Okay, so good afternoon everyone.
My target is to complete MARX, DURKHEIM and half of WEBER today along with PYQ. Okay rest we will do tomorrow. We are going to have four classes in this session. So tomorrow we will be done with thinkers and in the next two days we will do stratification, work and economy. Okay.

Okay so sociology of these three people is mainly the product of the changes taking place in Europe of those times. Okay so this is always going to be the context to understand these three people. Okay so I am going to start with DURKHEIM.

## **DURKHEIM**

Today first topic from DURKHEIM that we will understand would be Social Fact very important topic. Okay then I will talk about Division of Labor and how all these things are connected to each other.

### **Social Fact**

DURKHEIM always used to say one thing that until intellectual forces struck Europe everything was fine there was no social disorder there was social order maintained properly society was in equilibrium mode. Okay. That means individuals needs their ambition their aspirations their demands were controlled and regulated. Controlled and regulated by religion, family system, church system, state system, patriarchy. So these social forces had contained or regulated the need of individuals. But the moment intellectual forces strike Europe all those intellectual forces challenged these forces only. Patriarchy was challenged by ENLIGHTENMENT ideas. Similarly the idea of church religion was challenged by scientific revolution. Okay. Family system as MONOGAMY was also challenged by different ideas of ENLIGHTENMENT. And women as subject to patriarchy was also challenged by ENLIGHTENMENT thinker like MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT. Okay. That means intellectual forces, what they did, was to question all existing social forces like patriarchy, state, church, family. Okay. That means all those individuals needs which were contained by them those needs now got unleashed. Now they were given full freedom. Modernity individual was given full freedom. Okay. The moment individual gained freedom this actually led to what we call as social disorder. Okay. People were not paying heed to religion. Women were not paying heed to the idea of patriarchal system and people were not even paying heed to what we call as the idea of GOD or church or state system or monarchy. Okay. Now DURKHEIM says if all those forces which contained the need of individual have been questioned what is going to bind people together now. This is the basic idea if patriarchy questioned monarchy questioned state system is questioned religion is questioned what is going to bind people together. Okay. And that is how he said all those were social forms or forces or phenomena or fact which had contained the need of individuals. Now in the modern times individual are free to do whatever they like they have full aspiration full dreams to do whatever they like. If their dreams are not fulfilled they commit suicide. They may lead life of anxiety depression and therefore state has to do something to control or regulate the desires of individual. This is his entire basic philosophy, if you've understood.

So let us start with what is Social Fact basic and then I tell you the history also. Okay. So when we define Social Fact, so we would always say it is:

- Patterned way of:
  - collective thinking
  - collective acting and
  - collective belief
- External to and coercive of individuals. Okay.

So definition must be there when question of Social Fact. Patterned way of collective thinking, collective acting, collective belief external to and coercive of individual. Now let us understand what this is. So he used to say when individuals gather together whenever they gather together this gathering creates a phenomena which is external to any individual. Okay. And that actually you know is something that cannot be created by any individual. For example, if I take a fest, a college fest, that fest is a social fact. It is external to any of the students. It is coercive of any of the students. Okay. And the fest is more than sum of the students. Okay. And it is also different than any of the individual. So individual may go mad because it is fest time. Okay. So they do whatever they like super excitement होगी (will be there) उस टाइम पता ही नहीं चलेगा ऐसी वेव उनको बहा के लेके जा रही होगी (at that time they won't even realize, such a wave will be carrying them away). Okay. When four members when two members or some members come together it forms a social fact called as family. Family is a sentiment a patterned way of collective thinking belief which is external to any of the individual which has formed the family. Okay. Similarly religion has come into existence only because many people have come together and this gathering creates a belief collective belief which is external to any of the individual. So all those social facts are nothing but patterned way of collective thinking which is product of collectivity but external to any of the individual in the collectivity. Okay. So it is he here draws analogy to the human body. The human body consists of multiple organs but human body is more than sum of the organs. If you combine the organs human body is more than that. Similarly religion although consists of many individuals but it is more than sum of those individuals. It is not just individuals. Family although consists of four people husband wife kids but family is more than any of the individual. It is a sentiment external collective thinking belief external to anyone. Okay. So similarly relationship. Relationship is also social fact consists two people but it is something more than any of the two. So boyfriend girlfriend both will be regulated by the concept of relationship. Okay. So social fact, you have now understood its definition. So here we will write one line that:

- Social facts are more than sum of individuals put together. Okay.

And when those individuals come together. Okay. These are individual coming together. When these individual come together this gathering creates a phenomena which is external to any one of them. Okay. And this gathering is not just more than sum of these people this gathering is something different than either of the individual component. Okay. So fest is not just more than all those students it is also something different than any of the student. Okay. So:

- More than + Social Fact is different than any of the individual.
  So we just need to remember these two: more than and different than sum of individual. These two components. Okay. And DURKHEIM always used to call this:
- Social facts as **SUI GENERIS**.
  - Now the meaning of SUI GENERIS. Okay. SUI means self, GENERIS means generating. Self-generating. When 10 people got together, the party atmosphere was created on its own. Okay. The party mode was self-generating, no single person created it. It is formed by the coming together of 10 people, that party mode is being created. Okay. So SUI GENERIS means self-generating. And whatever self generated that thing was it is not just more than those 10 group 10 individuals it is also different than any of the individual. Okay. So party is different than any of the individual more than sum of the individual. Okay.

Now let's come to features. And then I'll give you examples. You've understood the examples anyway. Let's quickly understand the features.
Its features are few and far between, they come from the definition itself.

1. It is **external**. We understood from the definition, external to individuals.
2. It is **coercive**. If you are in a party, then why are you sad, be happy. Okay. So you have to be happy, the party will be going on. Coercive of individual. Okay.
3. Then it will be **general**. General in nature. That means you may find it universally. You may find party everywhere. You may find everywhere. Okay.
4. And then **SUI GENERIS**. SUI GENERIS we have understood. More than sum of individuals and also different than any of the individual. Okay. These are the total four features of Social Fact.

Now let us understand types of Social Fact.
There are two types. Remember there are only two types. You need to keep this in mind. Okay.

1. **Material Social Fact**
2. **Non Material Social Fact**
   Okay. Now don't think of normal pathological social fact. The definition, the classic typology that is only of two types. Okay. Normal pathological I will tell you where it fits, it doesn't fit here. So this is the type of Social Fact.

Now what is Material Social Fact? We will define this too.

- **Material Social Fact**: A social fact which is written or codified or directly observable.
  
  - Examples:
    - Constitution (codified)
    - New criminal laws (well codified) Okay.
    - Then you can also talk about any religious text which is well codified standardized and directly observable.
    - Anything sex ratio is also observable.
    - Data from government agencies.

- **Non Material Social Fact**: Its exact opposite. A social fact which is unwritten or not directly observable.
  
  - Examples:
    - Values. Values are not directly observable nor codified. Okay.
    - Morality
    - Collective consciousness
    - Collective effervescence
    - Social currents of integration and regulation. Okay.
    - Social cohesion.
      You understood the difference between material non material social fact. Okay.

Okay, wait. Okay. What does DURKHEIM say after explaining the types? He said that my interest, DURKHEIM says, my interest is not in studying this at all. I don’t want to study Material Social Fact. He always used to say my interest is to study Non Material Social Fact. And he always used to say Non Material Social Fact is the cause behind Material Social Fact. So this is the cause, this is the effect. So your values define what kind of laws we will have in society. Your values will define religious texts that we are going to have in society. The constitution that we are going to have in society. Okay. Sentiments of people will help us understand what kind of arrangement or what kind of sex ratio we may have in society. It is values which are the cause. Sex ratio is the outcome. Okay. So Non Material Social Fact, we will write this after types of social fact. We will say:

- Non material social facts are the cause behind material social facts. Fine.
  So therefore subject matter of sociology would be according to DURKHEIM not just study of social fact but study of non material social fact. Because this is the cause, so you will study this only. Fine. Everything comes from this. And in this, and in this, the underlying force is the gathering of individuals from which all this would have been created. Values would have come from gathering but values are greater than those gatherings, than any individual. Morality would have come from that gathering. Collective consciousness has come from it, effervescence has come. I will also explain you what is collective effervescence how different from consciousness. Current of integration regulation comes also from the gathering. Okay. And cohesion also part of gathering. And the same is the idea of constitution also comes into existence because of gathering. It is more than any of the individual who has made the constitution or contributed to the development of constitution. Okay.

Now after doing this much we need to understand that after this DURKHEIM is trying to study social facts as a scientist keeping social fact as unit of society. Now that we have understood non material social fact shall be studied so he will keep non material social fact as unit of study. Unit of study of society like laboratory. Assume society is a laboratory, its unit is non material social fact. Now he is going to codify rules of studying material social fact. Okay.

#### **RULES OF SOCIOLOGICAL METHOD**

It was a book written by DURKHEIM to explain to the future students of sociology how the non material social fact can be studied by any sociologist. Okay. So the book was designed to explain how social facts can be studied empirically through scientific methods. Okay.

So I start with the rules.
**First Rule that he explained (a question has come from this too, okay): Rule to observe Social Facts. That how do you observe social fact.**
First rule is this. Okay. So he clearly said:

1. First treat them as natural phenomena. Natural, just like we studied in the first three classes, we understood POSITIVISM that just like tree, animal, plant, asteroid, earth, soil everything exists naturally. Similarly you have to treat family, caste, religion, law existing naturally as if it is not made by humans. Okay. So the first rule to observe social fact is to treat them as if they are natural phenomena.
   - Treat social facts as naturally existing phenomena. And yes it is a fact that they are naturally existing. No individual has created them. They have evolved organically. Okay. Family is not creation of any individual. Family is a sentiment which has developed as more and more number of members united. Okay. So we have to treat these things as naturally existing.
2. And which means we have to treat them as if they are **things**. Treat them as things. Okay.
3. Then treat individuals as **atoms**. When atoms combine, a compound is formed. Okay. Similarly, when individuals combine, a social fact is formed. Okay. So treat individuals like atoms.
4. Then he says, now assume that atoms are governed by social facts. Okay. And that means patterned behavior of atoms can be observed. Okay. Social facts are external to the atoms, controlling atoms, and therefore atoms will have some patterned behavior since they are controlled by some social facts. Okay. So member of family will have some patterned behavior. Member of religious group would have some patterned behavior. Okay. Member of any group would have some member of college union student union would have some patterned behavior. Okay. Fine. This was the rule number one.
5. Once you have patterned behavior, just to extend this, you can easily collect data on it. Collect data on individuals' patterned behavior. Okay. Then find co-relation and all those things that we studied earlier in POSITIVISM, the same thing will come back. Okay.

**Second Rule: Rule to differentiate between Normal Social Fact and Pathological Social Fact.**
This is the second rule that he talks about. Now what is this rule? He clearly says any social fact is normal social fact if its occurrence is general, universal or inevitable. If it is present everywhere in the world then it is a normal social fact. For example crime present everywhere in the world it is a normal social fact. Family present everywhere normal social fact. Religion present everywhere normal social fact. Now what is pathological social fact? Any sort of deviation from the general occurrence would be called as pathological. So crime is present everywhere but if you see sudden spike in crime rate this is a deviation from the general occurrence of crime. Families present everywhere but if you see sudden deviation from the family pattern which is rise of what we call as SOLOGAMY. This is pathological. Okay.

- **Normal Social Fact**: General and inevitable, which is everywhere.
  - Example: Crime
- **Pathological Social Fact**: Deviation from normal.
  - Example: High crime rate.
    Okay. Or you can understand it like this, skewed sex ratio is normal social fact. Everywhere in the world sex ratio is skewed. Nowhere in the world you have balanced sex ratio. Okay. But if you see a skewed heavily in favor of men that means you see lot of female feticide infanticide taking place then it is pathological. So you need to study that particular thing. Okay. Deviation. So he always believed study the deviation. Okay. That will tell something about pattern of society.

**Third Rule: Make typology of Society.**
Fine. Typology of society where we have to just like we have typology of compound in chemistry, simple compound, complex compound. Similarly in society we can frame some typology like society, complex or doubly complex. He proposed a bipolar model of society. And bipolar means simple and complex. And the reason for calling any society as simple and complex is degree of specialization or nature of differentiation. If a society does not have specialized institution it has very simple institution then that society would be called simple society. But if society has specialized institution to deal with specialized type of activity, okay, that hyper complex bureaucratic structure, okay, or special kind of law for special kind of things, okay, then we are living in complex society. This what he used to mean. Okay.

- Typification depends on degree of specialization in society. Okay. Fine. Now.
  - For example, if we talk about crime, there is a separate police for cyber crime, a separate unit for drugs, a separate unit for cross-border terrorism. We live in such a specialized system for crime. Whereas in traditional society you would not expect so many different specialized units. All villagers are together for any crime. Okay.

**Fourth Rule: Study Cause and Function of Social Fact.**
Okay. So I start with cause. How to study cause of social fact? He always said cause of any social fact is another social fact. Cause of any social fact is not individual. It always another social fact. Okay. So, and we also studied above, like the cause of material social fact is also non-material. So:

- **Cause of any social fact is another social fact.**
  - Example: Cause of skewed sex ratio is patriarchy. Okay.
  - Example: Cause of religion is collective effervescence. Okay. So when people get excited in collective gathering, this brings religion into existence as a force, as a body of belief system.
- Then we talk about the **function**. He said if you want to study function, function of social fact means you need to understand what it contributes to the system in general. In what way it is contributing to the maintenance of society. Okay. So studying function of social fact means:
  - It means to study its contribution to the maintenance of society.
  - So we can study function of any social fact. Function of religion, DURKHEIM did, it's in our syllabus too, we will study three-four functions, what all those functions are.
  - There is also a function of crime. Crime is also necessary evil. Okay. To society. If there is no crime there is no new ideas there is no challenge to existing idea. And remember NELSON MANDELA, GALILEO GALILEI, GANDHI all of them were called as criminal in their times. But if they were not there society would not have moved on or would have maintained a new order. Okay. So crime is also helpful for maintenance of society to some extent. Therefore punishment should not be very harsh. If you make harsh punishment new ideas stop generating from society and society may not move ahead. So keep light punishment. Okay. He says this.

**Fifth Rule: Testing the Study on Social Facts.**
Now how do we test the study on social facts? Whether social fact is the cause behind another social fact. How do we test that? We can test this phenomena because if we are saying test, what are we testing? Whether this social fact came because of that social fact. To test this, the method is very simple: you compare. Like for example, DURKHEIM says if suicide rate is suddenly spiking in society it is a social fact and the cause for this spike in social fact suicide rate must be another social fact. Okay. And that could be low degree of cohesion. Now you need to test whether low degree of cohesion can really cause spike in suicide rate. How do you compare this? Just compare people with high degree of cohesion with their suicide rates. If you find high degree of cohesion having lower suicide and low degree of cohesion people having higher suicide that means there is some connection between degree of cohesion and suicide rate. This method he called as **Comparative Method**. Okay.

- So to test whether social fact can cause another social fact he suggested **Comparative Method**. Okay. And in comparative method what are we doing? We are doing, we are actually studying concomitant variation. Okay. So concomitant variation or comparative method, the connection is simple, that's all you need to explain.
  - Married people rate of suicide
  - Single people rate of suicide
  - And then religious people and atheist people.
  - Now DURKHEIM after comparing these two groups then comparing these two units in this group found out married people have low suicide rate. Single have high. He found out religious have low suicide rate. Atheist have high. And then he found out some common pattern. The pattern was wherever we find atomized individuals with low degree of cohesion like atheist have no faith to hold on to. So they are atomized therefore high. So he is finding variation, concomitant variation. From here, if cohesion is high, rate decreases. From here, if cohesion is low, rate increases. This is variation. Okay. We see this coming out in the comparative method. Fine.
- And eventually with this method he develops with this kind of analysis he develops **law of human behavior or generalization**. Okay. And his generalization, how did it emerge after all the study? Because he didn't just compare these, he compared many other things. Ultimately he developed a generalization:
  - $$ \text{Degree of cohesion is inversely proportional to suicide rate} $$
  - Okay. So we know now in modern society the degree of cohesion is low, so suicide rate is high.
  - Traditional society degree of cohesion is high, so suicide rate is low. Okay.
  - So this is across society comparison. And the one above was across group comparison. So we've seen two types of comparison. Okay.
- So eventually what he says is, you compare. The comparative method, he ultimately then says, you compare on three levels:
  1. Within society in different times.
  2. Within society across different social groups.
  3. Across different societies.
  - So he compared suicide rate in ENGLAND, FRANCE, DENMARK, he also compared three countries. Okay. This he did within society across different groups: married, single, religious, non-religious, young, aged, men, women, rich, poor. And this one was FRANCE, ENGLAND, DENMARK before industrialization and after industrialization. Okay. Across different time.
- Ultimately what he says is: **Comparative method is not just method but sociology itself.** Comparative method means sociology because it is due to this that generalization can be developed. When you compare then you find co-relation and with this co-relation you then finally establish a generalization the way we established degree of cohesion and suicide rate.
  This covers your Social Fact. Nothing beyond this has come in PYQs, and I am sure nothing beyond this will come because this is all there is. Okay.

### **RELIGION**

He clearly said religion is also a universal social fact. That means it is present everywhere. Normal social fact right. So to understand this normal social fact of religion he wanted to study the religion in its very simplest form. Okay. And therefore he chose to study religion among indigenous tribal people of AUSTRALIA that is ARUNTA tribe. Okay. And he found out that religious traditions whether in ARUNTA, FRANCE, INDIA, JAPAN wherever they may be present but across religious traditions there are some common patterns. Every religious tradition, even if they look different, have different books, different gods, but there is definitely a pattern in all of them. Okay. So after studying the ARUNTA tribe, he found a pattern at a simple level. So he said:

- Religion is not an individual experience, it is a social experience external to any individual. Okay.
- To understand religion he studied religion in its simplest form among ARUNTA tribe.
- After studying religion in ARUNTA tribe he defined religion. Okay.
  - **Religion**: A set of beliefs and practices which bring people together around what they regard as sacred. This gathering constitutes a moral community called church.
- So he simply observed through texts that ARUNTA people had some common traditions. They used to organize some festival some rituals be it birth ritual be it death ritual be it initiation ritual. When a child gets inducted then he is part of the festivity he is celebrating with the adults he is dancing around some animal. Okay. Eating with the adults. So these are some collective practices. And whenever the community is engaged in such practices they always have some mark on their body or some mark on their shoulder in whatever form or some mark on their walls of the houses. That mark represents what we call as representation of the clan that they belong to. Okay.

#### **Features of Religion in case of ARUNTA Tribe**

1. People assemble together. It creates a phenomena called tradition, ritual, rites, festivity etc.
2. These rituals take place around a **totem**.
   - So there will be some totem around which all these rituals are taking place. Okay. Like GANGA river can be seen as a totem around which all the ritual takes place. Okay. Similarly any GOD around which whole temple is constructed and rituals are taking place is a totem. Okay.
   - Yes, that can also be a totem. In fact, the tennis court during the FRENCH REVOLUTION, in that too the whole DECLARATION OF RIGHT was a totem around which everyone had gathered. Okay. Because tomorrow we will also have to compare how it is in modern society. Okay.
   - So if we define totem now, **Totem** is any object, plant or animal which represents collective sentiments. Okay. Which represents collective sentiment. Okay. So GANGA river represents our collective sentiments, that's why DURKHEIM also called totem collective representation. Collective representation of what? Of collective sentiments. It is a representation of people's sentiments.
3. People naturally consider totem as **sacred**. They naturally considered totem as sacred. Okay.
   - **Sacred** means anything that is forbidden and set apart from mundane life. Okay. Totem is their representation, of their sentiments, and it becomes very sacred for them. Sacred means it is different from the world, the rest of the world is different. Okay.
   - And rest of the world is seen as **profane** to them. Rest of the world is considered profane. Profane here simply means ordinary. Not bad. Ordinary. The rest of the world is just ordinary. This water is special, all other water is ordinary. Okay. Fine.
4. And last he gives **Totemic Principle**. Now what is totemic principle? Totemic principle is very simple. If people are collectively worshipping or organizing rituals around the totem then that means they are worshipping themselves. Okay. They are worshipping their own belief. Okay. So if I am worshipping totem that means I am worshipping my own self because it is my belief that it is it is representation of my sentiment. Okay. So totemic principle means:
   - Worship of totem means worship of collective sentiments.
   - That's why he used to say: Religion is nothing but society's own worship. Okay. Okay. This is the whole idea of DURKHEIM on religion, the basic idea.

Now let's come to, you don't need to explain what rituals the ARUNTA tribe had, all that is not needed. You just have to tell point by point like this, what will be there, the basic keywords.

#### **Functions of Religion**

Fine. You already know the name of the book, this book is ELEMENTARY FORM OF RELIGIOUS LIFE.
He clearly says there are total four functions:

1. **Social Cohesion**
2. **Social Cognition**
3. **Social Discipline**
4. **Social Euphoria**
   Total four are: social cohesion, cognition, discipline, euphoria. Okay.

Let us come to **cohesion**. What function of religion is this? This entire underlying philosophy of his is based on STRUCTURAL FUNCTIONALISM. He is studying everything like naturally existing system. So he would want to inquire the function of this naturally existing thing. Okay.

1. **Social Cohesion**: One of the function of religion is cohesion. He says that I have observed this collective beliefs have some function. It brings people together, unites them. So it becomes "We the people" from "I the man" or "I the woman" to "We the people". So "We the HINDU", "We the MUSLIM", "We the JEWS". So collective sentiments come out. This is one function of religion. It brings people together. Okay. And where do we see this bringing people together? In festivities, in events, where people leave their individual identities and bring out their MUSLIM identity, their HINDU identity, their JEW identity. Okay. On such events. So social cohesion's basic idea is:
   - Brings people together or binds them into a social bond.
   - National events bring us all together. Nation is nothing but new form of religion which has its own totems, flag, constitution. It brings everyone together. WORLD CUP in itself was a totem. It brought all the DELHI people together and all the INDIANS together. Okay. So again nationalism is nothing but a new form of social bond.
   - Fine. So now let's come to, and anyway, if you see here in traditional society too, the rituals that happen, birth rituals, death rituals, how are they too? Whatever our individual identity may have been throughout life, but when we are born and when we die, those religious customs are what come back. Okay. So it keeps people connected together.
2. **Social Cognition**: Cognition in the sense that religion has one important function. It helps individual to explain the inexplicable. It helps individual to tolerate the intolerable. It helps individual to make sense of the senseless world. Many things in this world are such that they seem senseless, intolerable. But religion gives us a tonic, gives us the strength to bear it, endurance. Okay. So it gives a cognition, why is it GOD that I was born poor while everyone else is rich. Then GOD throws flowers from above and it is understood, okay, there must be some reason for this. So the person becomes quiet there. Okay. So cognition means it gives you a thinking capacity. So we will say it like this:
   - It gives cognitive capacity to individuals to explain the inexplicable, tolerate the intolerable.
   - For example, questions on death, poverty, inequality, failure. Whatever questions come in our life regarding all these things, for them we become dependent on GOD. Okay. That after so much hard work why didn't I get success? How did someone with so little hard work get success? For all this we remember GOD, we get cognition from there. Okay.
3. **Social Discipline**:
   - It regulates desires of individuals and keep their needs limited. This maintains discipline in life.
   - We can have, as individual we are animal until and unless our desires are regulated by society. So religion plays very important role in socialization of individual keeping their needs limited and to make them feel complacent with the limited needs also. Because this what GOD has given to them this what they have come to believe. Okay. So it ensures conformity. Fine.
   - So here we will write it in one line like this: It ensures conformity and evades deviance. Individuals become conformists, they go less towards deviance if there is something called religion. Yes, it works like social control. Okay. So you will feel like stealing many things but you won't because GOD is watching. Okay. You will feel like using unfair means, no man, it will be wrong, it will be immoral. Okay. So it controls you. Okay.
4. **Social Euphoria**:
   - It brings highly excited state of affair among individuals.
   - It transcends individuals from the world of profane to sacred. This is also a function of religion, that it takes you from the ordinary world to a special world. Okay. Once you are part of religious festival community or any church you feel extraordinary about yourself. You feel completely different from the ordinary people. Okay. And this happens on occasions. Be it occasion of WORLD CUP if you consider it as new form of religion or nationalism sorry if you consider it as new form of religion then you will definitely see that the very excitement around WORLD CUP victory transcends people from the world of profane to sacred. They forgot all their sorrows, they were in extreme excitement at that time. Even the traffic police couldn't stop them. This social fact, this collective excitement was not in the hands of the traffic police, they couldn't stop it at all. Okay.

So this is what function of religion was. When it comes to cause of social fact, function we have understood. Cause of social fact we have already mentioned, it is another. For religion, DURKHEIM had coined a term: **Collective Effervescence**.

- **Cause of Religion**: Function we have understood. Cause of religion, which is material social fact, was or is Collective Effervescence which is non material social fact.
  - Now this collective effervescence is that super stage or super state of excitement. There is crowd and there is mob. What is the difference between the two? What is the difference between crowd and mob? Mob is a super excited state of crowd. Same people but this is a super excited state. Okay. So that mob is an example of collective effervescence. During GANGA AARTI, people will be super excited, at that time they will not do anything else, their focus will only be on what is happening. Okay.

This is all about religion. Now usually evolution, evolutionary scholars if you study, they would always put religion and science as opposite to each other. In the sense if society is modernizing religion is declining and modern scientific thinking is going to be the way ahead. However DURKHEIM never shared this view. DURKHEIM always used to believe that religion is an organism which will fight for its survival. Okay. And therefore instead of its decline we may find new form of variant. Just like a virus doesn't die, a new variant comes. Similarly religion also will not die because he is treating everything like a biological organ. Nothing dies, a new form of religion comes. Okay.

#### **Evolution of Religion**

So now we will give a subheading here: Evolution of Religion.

- Unlike evolutionary scholars (which included AUGUST COMTE himself, SPENCER, MORGAN, FRAZER etc.) who believed science and religion antithetical to each other, DURKHEIM believed religion will not cease to exist. Okay.
- He always believed religion is never about GOD. It is always about set of beliefs and practices around what people consider as sacred. And people can consider anything as sacred. Okay. Then how can we say religion will decline. Fine. People considered constitution as sacred when constituent assembly was formed. People considered national symbols as sacred when the symbols were formed. People can consider anything sacred collectively. Okay. So we cannot say religion will cease to exist. That is why he used to say:
  - "Old GODS are dead, new ones are yet to born."
  - Here GOD metaphorically means religion, even though he himself says religion is literally not about GOD, but he is saying it in a metaphorical sense. So old religion is dead, new one is yet to born.

Now we will understand the **New Forms of Religion in Modern Society**.

- Any practice that brings people together with common belief around what they regard as sacred can constitute religion.
  - **National Events**: Bring people together. Here you can put anything, REPUBLIC DAY, INDEPENDENCE DAY.
    - The crowd in a temple watching some rituals being completed, when you compare it with the crowd on INDEPENDENCE DAY around some rituals, there is no difference. The events may look different, but what is the underlying force? It is bringing people together under common beliefs about what they regard as sacred. We have to find similarities across differences, as a student of sociology. Okay. So these are your national events.
    - Yes, in this, as I told you, REPUBLIC DAY, INDEPENDENCE DAY. Cohesion, it brings people together as common, what we call, citizens, INDIANS. That INDIAN sentiment comes out during these events.
    - Second, I told you discipline, it keeps them controlled. That if you are standing and praying or singing, you are in a controlled state. You cannot move beyond 52 seconds, and if your mobile phone rings in between, then people will look at you. Okay. You are in a controlled state.
    - After that, cognition. That as a nationalist, I have certain thinking about what happens to my nation. And whenever nation requires me, I will be there. If something happens with PAKISTAN, then my mind immediately thinks, no, they must be finished. So my cognition, as an INDIAN, my thinking, my mindset is INDIAN. Okay.
    - And then comes the euphoria. When INDIAN sentiments come out, then everyone is out. What is there in this? Same thing. DURKHEIM thought like this. He never talked about HINDUISM, ISLAM. Okay.
  - **National Elections** or even State Elections. Okay.
  - **Constitution** is new religion. Okay. It is in itself a totem regarded as sacred. We have NATIONAL CONSTITUTION DAY also for the same. Okay.
  - Similarly there are some events like **Social Movements**. All social movements, there again you would see the same sentiments. Social movements of LGBTQ, you would see charged sentiment of LGBTQ with certain rituals, certain kind of colored ribbon that they may have held in their hands with some slogan. It is patterned behavior. In every social movement you may see these things. So all of it which brings people together around common beliefs and practices. The beliefs of the LGBTQ is to make the world as safe and secure for homosexual as it is for hetero. This is something which is binding all of them and they have their own set of what we call as slogan airing or rights or rituals. Okay. So you have to think at this level when you are talking about modern forms of religion. Okay. So if you get a question "Relevance of religion in modern times", you must write about this. Don't explain about HINDUISM, ISLAM there. Okay. Fine. So this completes your topic of religion. Okay.

### **SUICIDE**

DURKHEIM simply wanted to study suicide because usually it is seen as personal act and he wanted to show that even what seems to be personal or highly individual can be explained as result of some social forces acting upon it. So that is why he literally chose to study suicide.

- So here his interest was not to study suicide of an individual. This we need to remember. This was not his interest. This means why individual commit suicide, he never wanted to study this.
- So then what did he want to study? Rather his interest was to study:
  1. Why suicide rate changes from one group to another. Why is there variation in suicide rate across groups? He wants to study this.
  2. Second, what he wants to study is why suicide rate is almost constant in society. Okay. Population may change and all that will happen, but the rate is almost constant.
  3. Third, why suicide rate varies from one type of society to another type. These three things he wanted to study mainly.

So to find answers to all these questions he started with the RULES OF SOCIOLOGICAL METHOD.

- First he treated suicide rate, the number of people committing suicide, as natural phenomena. This many number of people are naturally going to commit suicide. It is natural, just like an asteroid's arrival is natural, suicide happening is that natural. And therefore he started treating social fact which is suicide rate as a thing to be observed or studied. Okay. He wanted to find out the pattern of suicide rate. For this he collected data. Okay.
- So here we will first define suicide rate:
  - **Suicide Rate**: Number of people committing suicide per lakh. In INDIA, it is per lakh. Okay. Fine.
- Used RULES OF SOCIOLOGICAL METHOD and applied scientific method to study of suicide rate. Okay.
  - So we need to pick up those basic points. His research question is this: Why suicide rate varies from one group to another. Okay. So for that he obviously did collect data.
  - **Data collection** from police station etc. This is basic. Positivists always rely on official data. They consider everything to be natural phenomena and they believe official data to be representative of natural phenomena. Okay.
  - **Data classification**. Then he classified the number of people committing suicide into groups like married, single, men, religious, atheist, aged, young, rich, poor, something like this. Some categories like this.
  - Then he talked about **data co-relation**. Okay. So he found out some co-relation. What does co-relation mean? Association. He sees some relationship between being single or being atomized and having higher chance of suicide. Whereas being part of a group and having lower chance of suicide. He sees some relationship in this. Okay. So he established co-relation between two variables. And what are the two variables here?
    - One variable is degree of cohesion.
    - Second variable is number of suicide cases.
    - Individually. So he found out members who are part of a group where cohesion is strong, their number of suicide is low. This association led him to eventually convert this into **causation**. Because eventually positivists initially find co-relation, eventually establish causation between the two.
  - But causation was not so easy. Before he established causation he wanted to do one more check, double check. At that time it was called **multivariate analysis**. Okay. So he did multivariate analysis. Okay. Now what is multivariate analysis? Basically if DURKHEIM is observing clear cut pattern: married people have low suicide, single have high. Men have high, women have low. Religious have low, atheist have high. He wants to be very sure that is man being atheist enough for him to commit suicide or is man is atheist is committing suicide because he is man also and single also. Which of these variable is having more impact on him committing suicide. Because a person is not just atheist. A person is not just poor or rich. What is a person? Rich, atheist, boy who is single. Person is the total of this, right? So he has to find out which of these four variables had the most impact on his suicide. To understand this, he kept multiple variables together and kept some constant to understand whose impact would be greater. You don't have to go into this much detail, but you must mention this word here. Okay. So in this we will write one line:
    - In order to understand which variable has had higher impact on suicide he kept few variables constant and studied relation between others. Or eventually he tried to develop a single causation.
  - The social cohesion as non material social fact, as I told you, behind every social fact the cause is another social fact. Social cohesion which is non material social fact defines the rate of suicide which is the material social fact because it is observable. Okay. Cohesion is not observable with naked eyes. We have to treat it as thing, as a phenomena. Fine. This is the study of suicide.
  - And from this causation he derived a **generalization**. That is, he developed a law. And the generalization is this: Higher the degree of cohesion, lower the suicide rate. Same thing again. Okay.
  - And now this generalization can be applied to two types of society: simple and complex.
  - DURKHEIM never studied function of suicide. He only studied cause. Only in the study of suicide did he leave out the function. Otherwise, he studies function.

#### **Types of Society and Suicide Rate**

Okay. Degree of cohesion, this law that he derived, eventually how and where is this law applicable?

- If I apply this law to **simple society**: In simple society DURKHEIM clearly says degree of cohesion is very strong. (We will go to that when we study Division of Labor). Degree of cohesion is very strong in simple society. People have common experience, common world look or out view or life style. Social bond is very strong. Their collective consciousness is very strong. Therefore rate of suicide in a village or in a tribe will be very low.
- But in a **metropolitan city** like BANGALORE, MUMBAI, DELHI, rate of suicide will be very high. Because there no one is your own, everyone is busy with their own things. Okay. Rate of cohesion is very low. In fact RAMACHANDRA GUHA also says BANGALORE is INDIA's suicide city because it moves very fast. Whenever any city is tried to be made like TOKYO, we need to keep in mind that suicide rate might increase there because TOKYO means it moves very fast. And where there is speed, there cohesion is minimal. Custom, all that, whatever it is.
  So we apply this to types of society and we will also get answers to DURKHEIM's questions simultaneously.
  
  | Society Type    | Degree of Cohesion | Suicide Rate |
  | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
  | Simple Society  | High               | Low          |
  | Complex Society | Low                | High         |

So as soon as any village starts to urbanize, atomization starts, cohesion starts to weaken. People become specialized, people have no time left, they are occupied in specialized role, work and they may get stuck, they may be stuck in regime, rule bound regime, 9 to 5. So their bond, social bond may get weakened. Their new bond would be there, staff, colleague, but that would not be very strong. That will be strong only in the office place. At home there will be no one to look after them. So they may start feeling depressed, isolated and may also have suicidal tendencies later on. Okay. This is what DURKHEIM used to say. So we saw this. Now we understand the question about type of society, why it is different in different societies, different types of suicide rate. Why it is different in different groups, we also understood that degree of cohesion is the ultimate factor there too. Here too, degree of cohesion is the ultimate factor.

#### **Typology of Suicide**

Based on Integration and Regulation:
|                     | **Low Regulation** | **High Regulation** |
|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Low Integration** | Egoistic Suicide   | (Modern/Complex Society - High Suicide Rate) |
| **High Integration**| (Simple Society - Low Suicide Rate) | Altruistic Suicide |
|                     | Anomic Suicide     | Fatalistic Suicide  |

- You find high integration and high regulation in simple society. Or in complex? Among members and high regulation on their desire in simple society. Okay. So you find these two in simple society. Therefore rate of suicide will be low. Okay. Rate will be low but suicide will still happen. Number of suicide will be relatively lower vis-a-vis modern society where there is low integration and low regulation. But nature of suicide will be very different here. Here the types of suicide will be of two type:
  - One because of high integration we will have **Altruistic** (people will give their lives for others in the village. Okay. Altruistic suicide).
  - Then we have what we call as high regulation, from that **Fatalistic** suicide.
- Then we come to low regulation and low integration. That is case of modern or complex society in comparison to simple society. Okay. So here suicide rate is high but nature of suicide is different.
  - **Egoistic** suicide.
  - And **Anomic** suicide. Okay.
  - Egoistic suicide is because of low integration.
  - And this is because of low regulation. Okay. This is the typology.

Beyond this, you don't need to study anything more in DURKHEIM. Now it could be, it's like, think of it as a model he has created. Tomorrow WEBER will call this an ideal type, it doesn't happen exactly like this in reality. Okay. Yes, that is interpretative study then, this is positivist study going on, meanings are not being seen here, only types are being seen. Okay.

- **Altruistic Suicide Examples**: You can give examples of altruistic suicide, you can create your own examples, these are simple, direct, you must have studied them. Okay. And you can easily talk about altruistic suicide across society. There you don't have to be conscious whether you are writing about simple or complex, you are simply giving an example of altruistic suicide. Okay. So you can talk about suicide bombers. Okay. You can talk about the traditional fighters involved in any war in at level of what we call as international conflicts who sacrifice their life as part of soldier as part of army defense. Okay. So there you can, altruistic suicide. And in fact during COVID, the COVID warriors, the doctors, you can give their example. Doctors knew that they may lose their lives but still they treated people. So they were called as COVID warrior also. So you can give all those examples. So here you mainly have to keep warriors in mind, no matter how they are, good or bad we won't say because value freedom has to be maintained. Warriors, apart from COVID, what else will come? Suicide bombers. You can talk about KAMIKAZE fighters which is also a conventional example, quite a good classic. Okay.
- **Fatalistic Suicide**: Fatalistic suicide is mainly because of high sense of regulation on the individuals. So when two people like for example are in love with each other, love marriage, okay, they are thinking of it but it is not somehow allowed by their parents. So what do they think? If we don't meet here, we will meet there, together above. So they jump. Okay. So their suicide is fatalistic suicide. Okay. And DURKHEIM himself didn't give much respect to fatalistic suicide, he wrote it in a footnote. He talks about master-slave relation there, that slave used to commit suicide because of the exploitation committed by masters. So you can write that here. Slave suicide. Or suicide by couple.
- **Anomic Suicide**: DURKHEIM used to believe whenever society is transitioning very rapidly in such cases we have anomic suicide taking place in a society. Okay. So like during lockdown there was sudden transition towards work from home. There was sudden transition towards what we call as online work or sudden transition towards shutdown of factories or suspension of labor laws. So so many things were happening at that point of time. Many people lost, many people struggled to go back to their places. In the on the way to their place they lost their lives. So all the reverse migrant cases that came, who lost their lives, you can simply put them in case of anomic suicide also. Okay. And then you can also talk about, what do you call it, suicide by farmers in case of uncertainties, when society is moving towards privatization. Okay. Liberalization. Farmers may not find so much of what we call as, you know, sentiment being shared by the government towards their concerns. So they may commit suicide in that case also. But it is happening in cases of sudden transition, whenever they feel that society is moving fast towards privatization, government may not be concerned about them.
- **Egoistic Suicide**: A welfare-istic society is mainly taking place among cases with low integration. Low integration is mainly felt by some people. Like for example, you know, when you study about student suicide. Okay. In KOTA. They feel a lack of integration. They feel they are victim of the hyper competitive world of merit where they have to prove themselves to be unique. Okay. So this hyper competitive ecosystem of learning is leaving them with very low integration making them vulnerable to prove themselves to be unique and different and therefore atomized. And this desire of them to be different may eventually take their lives. Okay. So there you can also put student suicide, classic example. Okay. Celebrity suicide also you can write. But yes, you can write. Yes, yes. When they don’t feel integrated with what we call as society as whole as to why whatever they are earning for. Okay. If they are not being recognized as good actor or if they are not being approached by directors they just earning money but they are not known or given recognition or they are not given any award they may go into sense of depression. Okay. So this is the case of suicide. Fine.

### **DIVISION OF LABOR**

Now let's look at Division of Labor last. Then I'll do PYQ. Okay, we'll do DURKHEIM's questions after this.
The theory of Division of Labor by DURKHEIM, basically:
| Society Type      | Division of Labor                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Simple Society    | Elementary form of Division of Labor (very simple in nature) |
| Complex Society   | Complex form of Division of Labor (specialization based) |

This is specific to Division of Labor, what I told you. Now its background, which is important for us. DURKHEIM says in simple society people are united by single social bond of what we call as common shared experience, common shared beliefs and common shared working life. So all of them are working on the fields or in the agrarian setup and that is why all of them can do what the other person can do. All of them are farming and some of them are also employing their family labor. Okay. So it is more like a close knit community working together on farm land. All the members of family know how to plow the seeds how to sow the seeds how to harvest the seeds. Okay. So nothing is very specialized about their skills. Everyone is having common skill. Okay.

- So here we will write: The social bond in simple society was based on **Mechanical Solidarity**.
- Social bond in complex society was based on **Organic Solidarity**.

Now what is **Mechanical Solidarity**?

- Solidarity as result of individuals sharing beliefs, experience and working lifestyle. Fine. People share same belief, experience and working life style, it creates mechanical solidarity among them.

And **Organic Solidarity**?

- This when does it develop? It does not develop with people sharing common belief experience or working life. Rather it comes into existence when people from different work sector or sometimes people having different roles come together. Like for example if I talk about LEVEL UP IAS or any coaching institution there is interdependence between teachers, management, marketing team, sales team, YOUTUBE team. All of them are interdependent upon each other. This is what we call as a organic solidarity. So we are as we as LEVEL UP IAS type, as we say, this solidarity that is coming, this is purely based on organic solidarity. Okay. So solidarity as result of interdependence between people involved in specialized roles or occupation.
  - Fine. I can see organic solidarity everywhere in modern society. I can see it in modern bureaucracy. The whole hierarchy represents nothing but organic solidarity between the bureaucrats ranged from GROUP D to GROUP A. Okay. I can find organic solidarity in global value chain system. If I see IPAD is assembled in CHINA. Coltan to make the IPAD is procured from DRC. Okay. And transporters or freight people are carrying that ore, coltan ore, way back to processing plant. So you would have some people who would take out that ore from the truck and who would then dispatch it to processing plant. And then finally the whole IPAD from CHINA is exported to USA. From there on it is dispatched all over the world. So this in this whole chain so many people were involved. Each specialized in different set of roles. This binds them into what we call as organic solidarity. Okay. So at international level too, we see it everywhere.

Now DURKHEIM, his one concern was, as I told you earlier in the lecture, that in traditional society the needs of individuals were restricted. The needs or the desire of individuals were very much regulated. We had religion, family, church, state system, patriarchy controlling the needs or desire of individuals. But in modern society which promised freedom, the so called desire which was controlled now got unleashed, got full freedom. Now this desire if it is not fulfilled in modern society may lead people to commit suicide or may lead people to resort to crime. Okay. So whatever anomie that you see in modern society that is actually result of unwavering support given to idea of freedom and no scope for people to fulfill those freedom. It's like freedom you got completely but resources are not enough for you to fulfill your ambitions. So you will go mad, your mind will be disturbed, frustration will be there, depression will be there, you might do something wrong. Okay. So whatever mistakes are happening in modern society it is all because of the ideas, liberation ideas. Okay. And regarding this DURKHEIM always used to say that I have no issue with individual rights. I have issue with the disruption caused by individual rights. Okay.

- So here we will write a line: Social bonds exist in both types of society. But the nature of social bonds vary.
- Now third thing that I would like to highlight here. Since people had common lifestyle, common way of working condition, common experience, if anyone deviated from the commonality he was subject to severe punishment. So here **Repressive Law** was practiced to ensure people don't deviate from the common shared experience, common shared lifestyle. Okay. Common shared world view.
- And here since people are given enough freedom, okay, to think independently, to work independently and to get specialized whatever way they like. So this freedom has to be protected. You can’t have severe punishment for that. And therefore the law shall be **Restitutive in Nature**. Restitutive law to protect the individual freedom. Okay. To protect individual freedom. This means very simply, here you could not question church. Everyone had common beliefs. Nobody could question it. If somebody would question it he would be subject to heresy, blasphemy. Here people can question church or religious texts without being declared as heretic or as committing blasphemy. Okay. So this much of expression is given freedom. Okay.
- And other than these basic difference we can also talk about the degree of cohesion and integration in simple society would be very high. Okay. High degree of integration and regulation. And here low degree of integration and regulation.
- Nature of suicide we have discussed. In simple society we have Altruistic and Fatalistic. In complex society we have Egoistic and Anomic. So in Division of Labor its entire typology is coming out.

Now in the book Division of Labor, one thing he did was to explain the typology, told everything about both societies. Now he is telling that if in modern society people are atomized, nothing is controlling them, they are given freedom, what is going to bring them together? What is going to keep people together? And we studied the only thing which can keep people together in modern society is interdependence, organic solidarity.

#### **Anomie**

Now when society is transitioning from simple to complex. When society is going from there to here, then currents of anomie are being unleashed. Now we need to understand anomie. Okay.

- **Anomie**: It is actually a phase of society where the desires of individuals are not regulated anymore. They have full freedom to achieve whatever they like, full aspiration to do whatever they like. But if the desires of individuals are not reined in or regulated, eventually if they are not able to fulfill those desires they may simply commit suicide or may do something which may not be suitable to the order of society. So we will write anomie is a state of moral disruption or a phase where desires of individuals are not regulated enough. Okay. Desires of individuals are not regulated enough.
  - So he clearly said in modern society those desire are unlimited. In modern society the desires are unlimited. And therefore individuals who are not able to fulfill desires may resort to deviance. May resort to deviance.

Now the last point of Division of Labor. The current of anomie, as I mentioned, is unleashed when society is transitioning. Okay. This transition happens in what ways?
**In what way society transitions to complexity?** This is a big signal and you have to use this as an example also. Okay.

1. When there is an **Economic Boom** in society, then understand that society is about to transition to a new state about which we don't know. Economic boom is one condition. Okay. What happens in economic boom? People are experiencing new heights. Okay. And therefore their desires would also be very high. Fine. And if they are not able to fulfill those desires despite economic boom, they may start doing something which may not be desirable. Okay. Sometimes when people start earning huge they may get cut away from their old traditional life which was a social glue to them. So like in KBC it happened that some man became a millionaire, then he forgot his wife, forgot his children too, then built a new house, new wife came, new children came. Okay. So the old social ties are breaking with economic boom. People's desires increased, all that. Okay. So in this we will write a line:
   - With economic boom individuals cut away from old social ties and may become atomized. May become atomized. Okay.
2. **Economic Bust** is also a situation. Same happens in economic bust. What happens with economic bust? People start losing their jobs. Individuals lose their jobs or employment during economic bust. This is what happens. Once you lose your job, okay, then what happens? You are not able to fulfill your desires or dreams. Again you may start feeling anxiety, depression, frustration. Fine. So you will see this pattern in both cases of anomie. Then there will be no one to talk to, will be alone, in depression, this and that will be going on. Okay.
3. Third factor is **Natural Disasters**. DURKHEIM also points this out here. Natural disasters. Whenever natural disasters occur in society, i.e., earthquake, cyclone, volcanic eruption, then again it causes displacement, havoc, or rehabilitation, or loss of life. People may start losing, disintegrated from their network. Okay. They start feeling that state is not doing enough for them. Okay. So natural disasters like earthquake, cyclone may atomize individuals.
4. Next, **Technological Disruption**. You will also use this. Technological disruption. Whenever it happens, the age of AI came, digital age came, AI can take away the job of individuals. Okay. So AI age may make individuals jobless. Okay.

#### **Abnormal Forms of Division of Labor**

And after this will come now, normal forms of Division of Labor, which is a cause of concern for DURKHEIM. Abnormal forms. Three types of abnormal form which worry DURKHEIM a lot.

1. **Forced Division of Labor**
2. **Anomic Division of Labor**
3. **Inadequately Coordinated Division of Labor** Okay.
- **Forced Division of Labor**: What is it? When people with right talent or merit are sitting on wrong position or when people with wrong talent or qualification are sitting on right positions. Okay. This is something that DURKHEIM would call as forced. And this happens mainly because people are given position not on the basis of merit. They are given position on the basis of contact, their sexual identity, their religious identity, their caste identity. When all these things matter more, then the natural division of labor, which can bring a good flow into the system, can create interdependence, that natural division of labor is not coming because you have forcibly placed people there who do not fit. Okay. So forced division of labor comes into existence when merit is taken over by ascriptive status like sex, religion, caste. In that case, what happens is that the people in that organization never feel good. They feel that no matter how much effort they put in, it's of no use. In the end, his religious factor worked there, his caste factor worked there, his religious factor worked there. So people don’t feel associated with the company. They feel like, let's leave this company, this company is not ours. They used to say a lot that we are all a family in the company, but now when they are working hard for the family, they didn't give them respect. Okay. So the person feels atomized there too.
- Then **Anomic Division of Labor**. Now anomic division of labor, he clearly says, this comes when individuals, all of them, are rewarded solely based on their reach, their social capital, instead of their skill, the skill that they possess. Okay. There you recognized their ascriptive status, here you are recognizing their social capital. Okay. So when social capital of individual takes precedence over their merit then it is called as anomic division of labor.
- Then comes **Inadequately Coordinated Division of Labor**. What happens in this? Here what is happening is that part time work or temporary work, you are looking for it. But part time work is not assigned to you or someone else is assigned part time work because you may not be seen as fit enough to do that because of you coming from certain sex, religion or caste something like that. And sometimes inadequately coordinated division of labor also happens when in the work place there is not enough coordination between employees. Okay. One team is doing something, second team is not working on the same task. Then again it brings an inadequately coordinated division of labor.

So eventually these three, and the four above (economic boom, bust, natural disaster, technological disruption), all of them have atomized individuals in modern society. All of them have atomized the individuals and weakened sense of cohesion among them.
And here, therefore, DURKHEIM says what is important is **State**. State shall come in here and State shall regulate what? Economic cycle of boom and bust so that people don't get atomized. State shall regulate rehabilitation program so that people again they don't feel depressed and they don't lose their close ones to natural disasters. State should regulate technology so that if AI is coming, state has some role in where and in what sense AI should be brought in, and where it should be stopped so that people don't lose their jobs. State should regulate the kind of division of labor that takes place in society. And for that State should give enough freedom to labor union so that labor union, a trade union, becomes strong and people, the workers, themselves make the owners accountable for what is going on, the inadequately coordinated division of labor you people have implemented, and what is this that you are not giving promotion to girls, you have maintained a glass ceiling. Okay. So all these things, laborers should be given so much power that they themselves make the owners accountable. So labor laws have a very big role. Ultimately whose role is it? Ultimately it is the State's role. That's why he used to say:

- **State is the embodiment of morality.** This is what DURKHEIM says.
  - Meaning, State is the only organ of society that can reintroduce those atomized individuals into a proper social bond. Okay. State can impart sense of cohesion among individuals.
  - Now what steps have been taken by the State to impart a sense of cohesion? Many things. Labor laws have been made strong so that workers don't feel atomized. Okay. The four new labor codes that have come, you can talk about them. Four new labor code. Okay.
  - For suicide prevention, so that people don't go into depression, don't commit suicide, for all that, State has made a NATIONAL SUICIDE POLICY last year itself. So wherever the current is weakened, State is coming in to strengthen, to foster cohesion. Okay.
  - Then similarly, strengthening labor unions has been talked about, promoting labor unions has been talked about.
  - Then spreading moral education has been talked about. Moral education. Okay. Moral education in what sense? Like why do we study ETHICS? Why do we study GS PAPER 4? So that bureaucrats are not just rule-bound, a web of cohesion that comes through morality, common shared beliefs, that should also be with them. They should not just become rule-bound. Okay. So moral education has its own role to play to keep individuals stay in the web of collective belief of morality. Okay. So that they become empathetic towards workers, towards peasants, towards women, towards any such section which may be feeling miserable. Okay.
- This is all about, I mean, in the end he says this much: **Organic solidarity alone cannot help until State plays its instrumental role.**
  - And other roles you can show of the State, so many, schemes like ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT. Okay. Or all social welfare schemes, NAREGA, REGA, all of them, what is their job? That people don't feel unemployment, they get employment. ATMANIRBHARATA is the same thing, that people maintain a sense of cohesion, don't feel atomized.
  - Similarly, there is a concept that in factories or restaurants or any industry, there is a system of awards. The concept of NATIONAL AWARDS. BHARAT RATNA, PADMA BHUSHAN, PADMA VIBHUSHAN, these are also given to aged people, and always to make them understand how important they are to the nation building, how important their contributions have been. So again, people get a new lease of life that the country is calling us, so we will do something for the country, this and that. So all these things that the State is doing, modern society itself is doing nothing. It is the job of this organ of the State.
- If you look at the examples of the ones above, forced division of labor, where do we see forced division of labor? Where instead of merit, who gets respect? Sex, religion, or caste. So in manual scavenging, we see that caste plays a role. 95% of people who are manual scavengers are because of their caste. Okay. When it comes to sex, glass ceiling, we see that many people are not in topmost position because of them being women. So here we see merit remains just a myth, ascriptive statuses play such a big role. So you can include all these examples. Okay. You understood.
- And what else has the State done to promote women further, so that their sexual identity does not become a hindrance? The State has brought women's reservation. Okay. Now it's in the public sector, tomorrow there's a pending bill for the private sector too, that will also come. Okay. So you would see women's representation in politics, education, bureaucracy will come, that is also State's regulation to ensure that the rising suicide rate among women decreases. Why is women's suicide rate increasing? Like last year in GS there was a question, women's suicide rate is increasing, why is it increasing? It is increasing because ever since the concept of gender equality came, women have got equal amount of freedom. Okay. Or if they have got enough amount of freedom but they don’t have enough opportunities available out there, then they may feel a gap between the desires and the ends that they have. This makes them commit suicide. MERTON also used this later in his deviance theory, the same thing with slightly different wording. Okay.

So with this DURKHEIM is over. It was a bit long on DURKHEIM, okay, but...
Inadequately coordinated, you can say anything like, timely payment is not happening for employees, or timely promotion is not happening for employees. Okay. Or there is a mismatch and conflicts are happening between different teams in the department or any industry. That is also inadequately coordinated division of labor. Okay.

The cause and function of DOL. Cause of DOL, and which DOL here? The cause of DOL he clearly said was solidarity based on specialized skills. This was the cause of complex division of labor. Okay. And when it comes to function, division of labor has only one function, it brings people together. It promotes cohesion among them. In complex division of labor since people from different roles are coming together it imparts sense of team among them. So in a cricket team also we see this, all 11 people are specialized in different roles. When all of them come together then we see that interdependence is being created, TEAM INDIA is being created.
Yes, that is a basic critique of structural functionalism, that cause and function get confused within the structural functional paradigm itself. Okay.

### **PYQs (DURKHEIM)**

Let's do some questions, then we'll discuss further.

1. Explain whether DURKHEIM's theory of Division of Labor is relevant in present day context. (2021, 10 MARKS)
   
   - *Approach*: First, we must define Division of Labor. Division of Labor is basically breakdown of occupations according to specialization. Fine. This is what we define Division of Labor as. When it comes to how it is relevant in the present day context, then you will directly say in the present day context we have complex Division of Labor which brings into existence Organic Solidarity. However, Organic Solidarity is present in very weakened form. The employees or the workers in the modern society don't really feel so strong a bond that they used to feel in a traditional society when they had caste, village and other identities around which they formed cohesion. Today there is nothing like that. So here you have to talk about relevance, meaning you have to show how in today's date complex division of labor, the three types of abnormality we discussed, giving an example of each, in what ways we see anomic, in what ways we see anomic, in what ways we see inadequately coordinated division of labor. You can explain that. Okay. In our discussion we had focused a lot on other things also other than division of labor. We had focused on natural disaster, economic boom bust and what else did we do, technological disruption. Fine. We know State, because of all those disruptions, individuals who get atomized, to take care of all of them, State has brought out different policies. For disaster, there is DISASTER MANAGEMENT POLICY. If someone feels that because they are a girl or from a lower caste or tribal, they are not getting access to education, then there is NEW EDUCATION POLICY. Okay. So that technological disruption doesn't happen, there is SOCIAL MEDIA REGULATION. Okay. So State is doing its role. But when it comes to work setup, within work setup, there you will have to show State's role a bit, how State has brought four labor codes to ensure that workers feel integrated, not feel mismanaged. Management, all those things you have to tell. Okay.
   - Yes, you have to tell both things. When it comes to relevance of Division of Labor, you talk about both Normal Division of Labor and Abnormal. We studied two-three types of abnormal. First was Forced, second was Anomic, third was Inadequately Coordinated. And what will come under Normal? Your normal division of labor in modern society is all about interdependence. Okay. And that interdependence you can show within the work setup, whether it is private or public. You can show how people are interdependent upon each other in bureaucracy, how they are interdependent upon each other in a restaurant, how they are interdependent upon each other in a college, in school. At global level also you can show interdependence. Okay. How different nation states are interdependent upon each other, you can show that too. When it comes to abnormal, that's why I am saying this, so that this is not missed. Okay. Because this was his big point. Forced, you can show that in bureaucracy, yes, there is interdependence, but why is it that women are under-represented in bureaucracy? Okay. Why is it that tribals or DALITS are under-represented in bureaucracy or minorities are under-represented? Why is it that HINDI speakers are under-represented? Okay. This means State should have some role somewhere to represent HINDI speakers. HINDI speakers may not feel integrated enough with the system that we have. Okay. So you will have to explain all these things like this. Okay. In normal, we will explain everything, how we see it in different places. Here, you must hit this, that how you show relevance.

2. DURKHEIM argued that society is more than sum of individual acts. Discuss. (2021, 10 MARKS)
   
   - *Approach*: This question is based on what we have learned already. Okay. How to phrase this, always keep this in mind, it will help you remember DURKHEIM's basic philosophy. Basically, when cells combine, they form tissue. Okay. When tissues combine, they form organ. Okay. When organs combine, they form body. When bodies combine (human body here we are talking about), it forms social fact like religion, that will come. And on combination of bodies what will come? State, which is social fact again. And what will come? Law, which is social fact again. Economy will come. Something called market force will come, which is independently getting created. No one is creating it. Okay. Let alone any poor person. So all these things are coming from the union of people. And when all these things combine, then what is formed? Society. Okay. And when many societies combine, then what is formed? Global social order. Okay. So eventually, society is more than sum of individual acts. This entire philosophy of DURKHEIM, we can trace it. If we have to approach the question, we will say it like this:
   - This philosophy of society being more than sum of individual acts is traced to organic analogy. Okay. Social morphology. Fine. Now you just explain organic analogy briefly. This compares human body with human society. Both consisting of organs which are SUI GENERIS. Human body also has many organs which are SUI GENERIS, self-generating. Cells combined, tissues formed. Tissues combined, organs formed. Okay. Organ is more than sum of tissues. Tissue is more than sum of cells. Okay. Similarly, in society many organs were created: religion, law, state. More than sum of individual acts.
   - We will say DURKHEIM considered all the social forces, institutions to be social facts external to individuals. Okay. The biggest problem with this question is there is no starting point. We don’t know what to define. That's why here we have to explain like this briefly. Okay. Now the question is on social fact.
   - Now write social facts are more than sum of individuals. So just write when individuals gather it creates a social fact which is more than and different from individuals.
   - Now you have to give examples:
     - Religion: set of belief and practices around which people gather together keeping something sacred in perspective.
     - Similarly when it comes to what we call as Fest: same explanation.
     - Nation: same explanation. Nation is more than sum of individual and it also different from any individual. Fest is more than sum of individual different than any individual. Religion is more than sum of individual different than individual. Okay.
     - Finally the Division of Labor in modern society. The division of labor is based on specialization. So if we are thinking of specialization it is not just our personal choice it is the demand of the organ. The organ demands us to gain specialization or to gain high skill so that we get accommodated in the system. Okay. So this is not our choice to do MTech or PhD. It is the demand of the system. So complex division of labor is an organic whole which is demand of system and more than any individual. Same religion, fest, nation, all this will continue.
   - Now in this theory, after giving examples, your role is to tell how society is not more than sum of individual, rather society is product of meaningful individual only. How individual look at society in different manner. Here you have to show the opposite side. That is, from structural functionalism you will go towards interpretative theory. So you will create a subheading:
     - **Society is not more than sum of individuals.**
     - Here you will introduce interpretative school. Interpretative school argues society to be product of meaningful interactions and experience of individual.
     - Now using these same examples, show what individual would think of religion. How individuals construct religion in their everyday life. They are not necessarily bound by common shared tradition. People may look at religion in whatever way they like. Okay. So to some music is a religion, to some cricket is a religion, to some something else would be religion. Okay. People may look at religion in different different manner. Okay. Some may use it as a means to gain acceptance in the community. Some may look at it as a means to obstruct freedom in their life. Okay. So people are looking at religion. Some may use religion to justify their condition. So how individuals are looking at religion. Okay. You will explain that. So individual experience of religion, you will explain this.
     - Similarly individual experience of fests. Why do people go to fests? Explain that, instead of saying that fest is more than sum of individual acts. People have their own reasons for going to fests. Okay. Some will go to fest because their friends are there. Okay. Some will go to fest because they want to form new friendship. Some will go to fest because fest helps them free themselves of the tension of examination. People have different reasons that how people look at fest. Okay.
     - Similarly how people look at nation. Okay. So this way you can approach the question. Fine.

3. What are the problems in observing Social Facts? Discuss DURKHEIM's views. (2020, 10 MARKS)
   
   - *Approach*: There is a slight issue with this question. I don't know if a representation ever went for this or not, because "in DURKHEIM's views" is problematic. DURKHEIM himself never described any problem. Okay. Although if the question was just "What are the problems in observing Social Fact?", then we could have answered it.
   - By saying, the first rule, the rule of observing social fact, there we had four-five things that we were supposed to follow. First we had to treat any phenomena as natural phenomena. We had to treat individuals as atoms. We had to treat those phenomena as things. And then we had to understand impact of things on the atoms, understand the patterns, and then record the data, classify data, find co-relation, causation, and then generalization.
   - Now what is the problem with this type of analysis? Then here you would say that you can never do pattern study, data-based study, objectively. Because in social world you can’t define a phenomena. You can't define suicide, let alone studying suicide rate. Some people may call it sacrifice. Some people may call it martyrdom. Some people would call it, what do you say, murder, not suicide. Because it seems suicide but it may not be suicide. Okay. So people have their own interpretation of what is classified as suicide.
   - Second, the data may not be really what we call as objective. Every official authority may have different data on the same set. Okay.
   - Third, there cannot be one cause. You can’t say degree of cohesion. There can be psychological causes, biological causes, many causes are there. Okay.
   - Then the interpretative school will say that this man did not understand the meanings of suicide. A rich man who commits suicide after losing his money in an economic recession versus a man who is giving his life for his family because they don't have food, so that food can be saved, or like the classic example of ESKIMOS is given. Among ESKIMOS, it happens that some people give their lives so that resources remain for others. Both committed suicide, but how different are their meanings involved here. These things are not involved in DURKHEIM's study. It just ends at degree of cohesion, high, low, high, low. It seems very mathematical, the meanings behind it are lost. So this is the problem with observing social fact.

4. Discuss the distinct sociological method adopted by DURKHEIM in his study of Suicide. (2017, 20 MARKS)
   
   - *Approach*: Now what is the distinct method? Comparative method, we need to remember that. Okay. So comparative method must be defined and then you talk about types of comparative approach that he followed. And then you can easily describe those three types of comparison that he did for suicide: within society across time and space, and across different social groups, and across different societies. Okay. Simple.
   - Yes, so you can say it like this, the distinct sociological method that he used was based on positivist philosophy. The method, comparative approach. Giving such a passing reference to positivism will be enough. The main focus should be more on comparative method because there anyway we will explain that suicide is treated as natural phenomena, so subject to, you know, study of co-relation, classification, generalization. All that you will explain further in comparative method.
   - Include in this too, from comparative method, when it comes to DURKHEIM's sociological method, the entire discussion starts from comparative method and ends there, nothing else. Okay. Comparative method is the major hero of this question. Okay. So sociological method means comparative method.

## **KARL MARX**

I will finish this quickly.

### **HISTORICAL MATERIALISM**

To understand this we will make a table. We will do HEGEL versus KARL MARX. Okay.

| Feature                    | HEGEL                                                            | MARX                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Philosophy**             | Dialectical Idealism                                             | Dialectical Materialism                                                       |
| **Evolution of History**   | History of society evolves mainly because of evolution of ideas. | History of society evolves due to evolution of material conditions (economy). |
| **Goal of History**        | History evolves until absolute idea is reached.                  | History evolves until absolute material condition is reached.                 |
| **Mechanism of Evolution** | Evolution takes place due to dialectics between ideas.           | Evolution takes place due to dialectics between classes (economic classes).   |
| **Primacy**                | Ideas are primary and material conditions are secondary.         | Material conditions are primary and ideas are secondary.                      |
| **Origin of Ideas**        | Ideas are creation of cosmic plan.                               | Ideas are creation of ruling class.                                           |

Okay. These are the basic differences that you must write and explain them. Now let me explain you what ideas are. Okay. HEGEL's philosophy is very simple. HEGEL completely believes in GOD, accepts him, and says whatever we see in society, the arrival of a hero, NAPOLEON's arrival, was GOD's calling. LOUIS XVI's existence was GOD's calling. LOUIS XVI's departure and the revolution was also GOD's calling. All these people are actors who are following GOD's direction. This is all being directed, they are all moving. Okay. So FRENCH REVOLUTION also happened from there, everything is happening from there. Constitution also came, TENNIS COURT OATH, DECLARATION came, everything was a calling from above. And so called, what do you say, monarchs were removed and then landlords came, this was also the calling of the one above. KARL MARX doesn't believe all this. KARL MARX says that the one above himself is created by the most superior class among those below, the ruling class. Ruling class have created GOD. Ruling class have created religion, law, family, education. So if any idea is coming, it is coming from the ruling class. Ruling class is the tiny minority. Ideas are creation of ruling class. So if family system is like this, it is because ruling class wanted it this way. If law is like this, it is because ruling class wanted it this way. Because law, family, religion, education all of them are created by ruling class to protect the interest of ruling class only. Okay. So the ruling class is the one which is at the base. Ruling class created ideas. And ideas are secondary. Ideas are creation of ruling class. So everything that is idea, it is creation of superior class. So from this, in the end, you will place this diagram:

- **HEGEL's Case**: Ideas → Material Conditions
- **MARX's Case**: Material Conditions → Ideas

Okay. MARX used to call ideas as **Superstructure**. Okay. All these ideas form superstructure. And he believed all these ideas are created by the ruling class. Okay. Meaning, what kind of state will it be, what kind of laws will there be, what kind of family system will there be, all that is the creation of the ruling class. Now we will understand further how family is created by landlords and bourgeoisie, why he said so. This is the basic difference. So if you get a question "How MARX critiqued HEGEL?", which has been a PYQ, you just keep this table in mind and then develop the points. Okay.

Let us now come to **Historical Materialism**, which is MARX's philosophy.

- First, we will give the definition: A theory given by MARX to explain how history evolves in a dialectical manner. Okay. How history evolves in a dialectical manner through changes in material conditions. Okay. When you define, you don't need to write this much "theory given by MARX to explain", you can directly write this theory explains evolution of history in dialectical manner through change in material condition. Okay.

Now let's come to **Salient Features**.
First of all, the feature of this theory, it has some assumptions. Every theory is based on some assumptions. So there are some assumptions that MARX has taken.

1. **Assumptions**:
   - First, he has taken that man, innately man is a **working being**. This is his first assumption, that a person's identity is from his work and nothing else. Okay. Man is a working being and man express his creativity through his work. There is no other way of expressing oneself other than work. This is his assumption.
   - Second assumption is that **ideas are creation of ruling class**. Ruling class means the tiny minority class which differs in every historical epoch.
   - Third assumption is that **economy is the base of society**. Okay. And superstructure justifies conditions in economy. This entire theory is based on these three assumptions. Superstructure justifies conditions in economy, meaning law will be made to justify conditions in economy, in favor of the ruling class. Economy means the ruling class is being talked about. Okay. Education will be such that it supports the ruling class, promotes the ideas of the ruling class, makes people workers, not job creators, creates more workers. Such education will be there. There will never be a college for how to run a startup. There will be a college for how to get a job in a startup. More workers will be created. Okay. What kind of family system will there be? Nuclear. If it's joint, you will be considered inefficient, taking too many holidays. Nuclear family will be considered fit because it provides you mobility. Okay. So family structure, education structure, law, everything will be such that it goes in favor of the ruling class. Fine. Okay.

Now let's come to basic **Factors**:

1. Material needs (i.e., food, clothing, shelter) are the primary need of human beings.
2. Since they are not readily available, individuals enter into social relations of production. Bread, clothes, house are our basic needs. But because they are not available openly in the market, we have to work with people to get all these things. Either we have to join them, we have to open an office, run a work setup with them, or become their employee, become dependent. We have to enter social production so that we can make all these things accessible for ourselves. Okay.
3. Then once we have teamed up with them, paired up, then what do we do? This relation of production will help transform raw material into finished good. Okay. The raw material is converted into finished good by working together. Okay. You people are working in an office, so you are providing some service, some good. But after making it together, sitting on the assembly line, you have finally given it shape. Raw material has been created into finished good. Okay.
4. So this is done using certain **Means of Production**. Through means of production, you convert raw material into finished good. And what are those means of production? Tools, technology, human labor, land, factory, anything can be. Data is also means of production. Okay. Through all these, we convert raw material into finished good, into finished service. And then we sell it, then we get money, then we are able to fulfill our need for food, bread, clothes, house. Okay.
5. And then he says, the means of production are eventually owned by a tiny minority. There is a group that takes over that means of production after a point of time. Okay. As your need for bread, clothes, house is fulfilled, you start thinking of having more needs, secondary needs. To fulfill the secondary needs, new means of production are required. Okay. Meaning, new technology is needed, new tools you need to fulfill those means of production, to fulfill those needs, secondary needs. But those new means of production are owned by a certain class of people. So they would be called as the owners of means of production. Okay. People working for them would be called as the workers or the subject.
6. So eventually ownership is justified with the help of superstructure institutions created by the ruling class. So for example, if landlords own the land, then this ownership will be justified by the priest class. Priest class will say that GOD has given them land. These people are representatives of GOD. If we don't work for them, then we are committing a sin. Okay. So if we are not obedient, then we are committing sin, will not go to heaven. So these kind of ideas are created by ruling class.
7. Eventually inherent contradiction in the economic system, class struggle develops. Okay. The old economic system collapses and new comes into existence.
8. In the end, he says, **Class struggle is the motor of history**. Okay. This is the salient feature of a theory called Historical Materialism. Okay. This theory makes economy the base, and all institutions superstructure. This theory clearly says the base is run by few tiny minority called ruling class. And this ruling class own the means of production. And the other people will work for this tiny minority. And why they should be working for this tiny minority and why tiny minority should own means of production is justified using the superstructure. But after point of time contradiction develops. Inherent contradiction is very important term here. I will explain it later. Some such problem starts in this whole system due to which the system cannot continue. And the working class over a period of time develops an antagonistic relation with the ruling class. Revolutionary tendency develops. The old mode of production collapses and the new mode of production develops. Okay. This was the theory.

#### **Relevance of Historical Materialism Today**

If relevance of Historical Materialism is asked, it means you have to tell that yes, there is a working class which is actually working for few tiny minority people and they are not feeling very happy about it. That is why we see so many people from working class having movement against the ruling class. So we see people demanding what we call as minimum wage. People demanding working hours to get fixed. People demanding platform economy worker especially if you see, to get their work recognized or to be seen as organized worker setup. Okay. So you can tell that the demand for labor code among people has come from the workers below, which shows how workers are not really feeling so complacent with the kind of economic system that we have. Then you can also explain how inequality is increasing today. Okay. And why we see people protesting across the world and we see people protesting in form of working class against the owners of the tiny owners of the, what do you say, enterprise. So we may see people also going for GREAT RESIGNATION, as we call it. So people are not really opting to work anymore continuously in the same repetitive task. They choose to opt out of the work condition if they don’t feel any sort of pleasure that they used to gain from the work. Okay. So from all these things, from all these developments, we see how relevant Historical Materialism is even today. So we will write:

- Its relevance is visible when we see following events:
  1. Demand for **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**. Okay. Which shows that there is clear cut inequality and people are not happy about it. This shows relevance of Historical Materialism.
  2. Demand for **social security** through housing, health infrastructure, education.
  3. **Labor laws** which are not in favor of working class. Okay. So you have to show a lot from the working class side.
  4. Demand among **gig workers** to regularize their work. They also want that what they do should be covered under social security net. Otherwise, they don't get pension, insurance, unlike regular employee at work place. Okay. This is their demand.
  5. Demand among **women** to regularize their working condition. Here you can talk about WOMEN RESERVATION BILL in private sector, which is a pending bill. Women reservation bill in private sector. Okay. And workplace harassment.
  6. You can also talk about relevance of Historical Materialism by showing **global inequality**, that there is developed country then there is under developed or under developing. Regarding this you can also talk about ANDRE GUNDER FRANK's DEPENDENCY THEORY. Okay. Yes, you can talk about that too. Global inequality between developed and developing nations. Okay.
  - Meaning, when you are writing relevance, don't write any thinker's name. Pure GS. Pure GS, but that GS well connected to the theory given by thinker. Okay. In relevance, you will never write RALPH DAHRENDORF's name, ERIK OLIN WRIGHT's name. In relevance, only and only the basic GS, first attempt type, you will write. Okay.

Now if we talk about **Not So Relevant**.
Okay. Now for not so relevant you can easily tell. For this I will have to go a bit further. Before I explain you not so relevant, we can talk about:

1. **Expansion of middle class**. So the way MARX imagined the world to be divided into two classes, that is not really the world that we are living in. Rather we see expansion of middle class. So we don’t see clear cut polarization. So that makes MARX's theory of one class overthrowing another class as distant dream. Okay. So expansion of middle class, you can talk about. And this middle class is aspirational class. It looks up to bourgeoisie. It does not condemn bourgeoisie. Okay. They want to lead the same life style. This what they aspire to be. Fine. So this is called embourgeoisement in GOLDTHORP's language. So they look up to the, what do you say, good life style or luxury life style.
2. Okay. You can then also explain not so relevant under that today we are living in a world where we have **trade unions**. Okay. We have labor laws coming up. Okay. And when there are trade unions, it means that the scope for workers to mobilize and overthrow, that scope diminishes because the job of trade union is to bargain. It does not think of overthrowing. It thinks of having collective bargaining agreement (CBAs). When we have bargaining provision then why to think of overthrowing directly. Okay. So these are basic basic things. Yes, that's why I said not so relevant. Okay.
3. And you can also say that **working class is also not so homogenous anymore**. Fine. Working class is not so homogenous. Today we see female working class as part of working class. Okay. We see people from different background also to be part of the working class. And for them to unionize and have a common consciousness is very difficult. WEBER always used to say that status differences always prevent a common class consciousness from emerging. Okay. So even if there is class consciousness common but since people in the class do not share similar background, status differentiation will always prevent homogenization of class. Okay. So those are all basic basic things that you can write here. That we don’t have common homogenous working class. Basic points.

### **MODE OF PRODUCTION**

Critics I am not telling you in any of this. Okay. Critic, you just think of one or two thinkers and write them down. Okay. I am not telling critics. Otherwise, the focus shifts more to critics, and there's not much benefit in that. Marks come from what is asked. There's not much scope for writing critics. Okay.
Mode of Production, first we need to define what is Mode of Production.

- **Mode of Production**: Refers to the way society is organized to create goods and services. The way society is organized to create goods and services, that organization is called Mode of Production. Okay.
- Now Mode of Production has two elements:
  1. **Means of Production**: The tools or instruments used to create the goods and services.
  2. **Relations of Production**: Relation between the classes who are working to produce the goods and services. Okay. Relation between classes who are working to produce the goods and services. Tools used to create the goods and services. Way society is organized to create goods and services. So "to create goods and services" is common. Okay. In all three.

Now in Mode of Production, what is the most important thing? There are four types, we already know that. More important than that is **dialectics**. Now we have to explain how dialectics operate in each mode of production. What makes mode of production collapse? What makes another mode of production come into existence? Okay.

#### **Modes of Production and Evolution**

Each mode of production collapses due to **inherent contradiction**. Here your theory of dialectics will come into play. And from the ashes develops the new mode of production. Now let's understand how it happens.

1. **Primitive Communism / Society**:
   
   - People were collectively using their resources to produce goods and services. Whatever they would produce they used to share it with the people. Okay. Nobody was privately owning any produce. Anything that was produced was collectively shared across people. This is how the communist mode of production was like. Okay. There was no two different classes. There was only one horde system. Okay. ENGELS also uses it later, there was a primitive horde, all alike, no differentiation. There was no ruling class, no working class. There was communism of everything. Communism of husband, communism of wives, everything was shared. Okay.
   - **Inherent Contradiction**: Eventually as needs developed (i.e., you moved from primary to secondary needs), to fulfill those needs new means of production (i.e., new technology) was developed to fulfill higher needs. But this new technology was now owned by certain people. Okay. And the other people now started working for them. So the horde system, the primitive horde, was now started to get differentiated between the ruling class and the working class. Fine. So this means that new means of production created an inherent contradiction, or due to the development of new secondary needs, contradiction is arising in society. That new means of production is coming, whose owners are coming, and the society which was an organic whole is differentiating, dividing into two. Fine.
     - Basic Feature: Production collective, Distribution collective, Ownership collective.
     - With time secondary needs develop. And we studied earlier, when secondary needs develop, new means of production develops.
     - With this new means of production develop. And when new means of production comes, it is privately owned. Okay.
     - And that private ownership is, MOP is privately owned by tiny minority.
     - This ultimately means we saw this phase, society divided from an organic whole into two different classes. And behind all that was the development of secondary needs and the development of new means of production to cater to secondary needs. And eventually the arrival of private ownership. So these three together became inherent contradiction.
     - This primitive communism and this development of class structure. Okay. Where the upper ones became masters and the lower ones became slaves. And as soon as this came, at the same time this went. Its arrival means this is going. And this is not coming at any particular time period. It is evolving like an organic whole. Meaning, it is being born from its ashes. So slave society coming into existence with the collapse of ancient society. Fine.
   - Now you have to remember, what are we giving importance to? We are giving importance to inherent contradiction, what internal changes are happening in the economy due to which the economy is changing. Fine.

2. **Ancient (Slave) Society**:
   
   - What is happening here? Here we have production by slaves. Distribution is unequal. Okay. Maximum is owned by or usurped by masters. Very little is left to slaves. Ownership by masters. Okay. So collective, collective, collective, all that changed. Okay.
   - **Inherent Contradiction**: Now what is happening next here? Over a period of time, same formula you have to apply. With time secondary needs develop, whose? Masters'. Okay. And new means of production develop. Okay. New tools were explored, new technology was developed. So diamond mines have to be explored. Okay. Some very expensive luxurious stones have to be explored. Okay. So in all that, slaves are being exploited. They are going into mining, into plantation. They are working all day and night. Concept of cash crops is coming. The crops which can get the masters more and more amount of money. Okay. So eventually MOP is owned by masters. And after this we see how masters exploits slaves in plantation economy, through slave trade, through mining. So MARX says eventually certain condition develop when the slaves are not able to take exploitation beyond a point. What happens? They unite and that brings slave revolt. So again inherent contradiction within the system. Okay. Is leading to the demise of the system itself. Then we see slave revolt. And with this comes the collapse of ancient slavery society. So here too you have to highlight these in inherent contradiction. Inherent contradiction. Okay.

3. **Feudal Society**:
   
   - Feudal society also has the same system. Basic things you know. Let me directly tell you what the inherent contradiction was. Okay.
   - **Inherent Contradiction**: Okay. What happened was there were two reasons: one was internal and second is external reason.
     - **Internal Reason**: The productive capacity of land started declining after point of time, which today we call agrarian distress or rural unrest. Okay. Land fragmentation happening, or soil salinity happening, or over production happening, or whatever you may consider, soil fertility diminishing, or if on time the serfs were not able to pay the landlords. Okay. So those were some of the reasons. Or extra demand from the peasants, which we see historically in CHAMPARAN, or in BARDOLI, we see how extra demand is being made on workers, that beyond a point, despite not being able to produce, they have to make a certain amount of payment to the landlords. So that is an internal reason.
     - **External Reason**: External reason means some factors beyond land due to which land-based economy is declining. Industries being set up, mercantilism coming, merchant system coming, enclosure movement happening.
       - **Enclosure Movement**: What happened was, enclosure movement, I'll tell you. Enclosure movement basically what is happening is many landlords, they decided to fence off all their land and start grazing cattle so as to produce cotton and wool, not food crops anymore but cash crops. Enclosure, you must have seen in villages, some people fence their lands with walls. Okay. We then ask whose it is, don't know, this wall has been here for a long time. That is called enclosure, just closed it off. Now what's happening inside, sheep and goats are being grazed, animal husbandry is happening, whatever it is, for producing dairy products or for producing cotton wool products, all that is being started because cotton and wool are in demand in industry, for clothes and all that. So here in enclosure movement, landlords, on the land where they used to produce food crops, enclosed that land and started arrangements to produce cash crops there, so that they could finally sell it to industrialists, to RAYMOND or other companies, and then they would keep getting the final product, whatever it is. Okay. Enclosure movement is that. So this is an external reason. Why external reason? Because industry is developing. Okay. So to cater to them they are making enclosure. Fine.
       - Second external reason is people finding working opportunity in city life. Migration was also one of the reason for the land based economy to collapse because peasants were not available anymore. They had developed aspiration with city or urban setup coming in. They wanted to migrate to urban pockets and wanted to experience new lease of life. Okay. So this was also one of the reason.
     - And internal reason I have already told you. Soil salinity or irrigation issue or payment issue, whatever. Ultimately all these are inherent contradictions. Okay. Due to which what is happening? Land based production system is declining. Here too we saw people leaving their food crops and growing cash crops, and that cash crop too, not sugarcane and all that, but cotton and all that. Okay. So land based production system is declining. Inherent contradiction. Due to this, ultimately feudalism also collapses. And many landlords also started migrating to cities to become industrialists. So they have kept land in the village but they are now just aspiring to become industrialists in the future. Okay.

4. **Capitalist Society**:
   
   - So from here starts your capitalist society. Now this is very important. What contradiction develops in this, according to MARX? So MARX always believed that in every mode of production inherent contradiction will develop. And only with the development of those contradictions the mode of production will collapse. This happened in all the previous mode of production. Capitalism is no exception to that rule. The same thing will happen to capitalism. Now we need to understand what is going to be the inherent contradiction in capitalism.
   - So its basics, you don't need to tell, what is means of production and what is relation of production, we know that. Capitalism's basic **Inherent Contradictions** due to which this will collapse, according to MARX, are:
     1. First, that in capitalist society the goods are produced purely for **profit**. They are not produced to meet the needs of human. They are produced only to have more and more profit. And therefore you may see **overproduction of goods**. That means you may see a lot of waste generated. So waste, i.e., surplus will be created, waste will be created. Why is overproduction happening? Because goods are produced for profit mainly. Okay. So overproduction of goods for generation of profit. For generation of profit. This basic inherent contradiction due to which this system will sink, according to MARX. This produces lots of waste, surplus. Okay.
     2. Goods are produced for profit and **not to serve human needs**. Now what does this mean? This line is very important of his. Okay. Goods are produced for profit not to serve human needs. Here, two concepts of his come up.
        - First of all, some things that we don't need, we are made to feel that we absolutely need them. Okay. So that they can make profit. Fine. It was never our need. It was their need. Here comes MARX's concept of **Fetishism of Commodity**. Okay. Fetishism of commodity comes from here. That we are made to feel that we really want those goods. And how we are made to feel that we want them? The way they are advertised. Okay. So in advertisement your identity as cool or the man or the woman is identified with the commodity. So an identity is created around commodity. So commodities are presented with inanimate quality. Commodities are presented as if they are super natural objects which are possessed by very few people. Okay. So that craving, as we call it, that thing we see here.
        - And when it is said goods are produced for profit not to serve human needs, it means that goods have **exchange value** in capitalism, not use value. Exchange value is given more importance over use value. So here the second concept comes: Exchange value more than use value. Meaning, create those goods whose exchange value is high. Leave those whose use value is high. Create those which make more money. Okay. Fine. And those goods, the good which have exchange value more than use value, those goods are called commodity. Okay. Such goods are called commodity. Fine. So ultimately he says commodities are created in capitalism, not goods which have use value.
     3. Third, he says that in order to save a lot of money, industrialists always try to cut down on the basic minimum fixed cost, which is the **wage**. Okay. So he tries to get the wages cut. So what industrialist would do is to replace you by machines which are more efficient, more productive, more time saving. And that means labor cost is cut down by replacing the labor by machines or technology. Now what will happen due to this? Due to this, machines will come, technology will come, labor will start losing jobs. Unemployment will be created. And these unemployed people will form second concept: **Industrial Reserve Army of Labor**. Okay. And remember Industrial Reserve Army does not mean only unemployed people. It also means part time employed. It also means under employed. People who settle for less than their capability are also called reserve army in MARX's language. Okay. So we will do these in detail later. This is the third contradiction.
     4. Fourth contradiction, because workers are replaced by machines, that means **purchasing power of workers have gone down**. And if purchasing power has gone down, overproduction is happening above because of machines. So what will happen due to this? When you have overproduction in economy and under consumption in economy, then we have **recession**. Okay. So overproduction + under consumption = Recession. Why is there under consumption? Because workers don’t have purchasing power. And why is there overproduction? Because machines are there, and with machines overproduction is taking place. Okay. So overproduction with machine. Recession came. When recession comes, then what happens? MARX further says that all these are inherent contradictions of the system. This system will have to face all these. So according to MARX, feudal economy never faced recession. Slavery society never faced recession. Only capitalist society is facing recession. Which shows that capitalism is highly irrational economic system. It has some things which should not have been there. Otherwise, those things would have happened earlier too, but they were not there during feudalism. Okay.
     5. Fifth, when recession comes, then what happens? Small players exit the market first or the big players? Small players. Meaning, small and medium enterprises would be somehow exiting the market. Okay. Not all of them but some of them may exit. And what happens is the big players would somehow buy them out. The small and medium players, big players will buy them. And due to that, what will happen? The big player will become a bigger player or the biggest. **Monopolization** will start here. Okay. So with recession the small and medium enterprises may lose market share and may be bought out by big players. This is called monopolization. Okay. Monopolization by big player. Because it is also true that, for example, in the steel industry, cold drink industry, there used to be many players. Today only two are left. Okay. Major. There used to be 60-70 globally. Now only two are left. Steel industry also had many players, only five-six are left. Okay. Meaning, where is the world heading? Where monopolization of resource is happening and hoarding of that resource is with only a few people. And then eventually that monopolization we also see during lockdown, we saw how some sectors started expanding so much. They bought out many small medium players. Okay.
     6. Now when monopolization is taking place, in this MARX says one thing. That when big players are buying out small players, not all the small and medium players are bought. Some of the small and medium players actually go out of the market for ever. They start finding jobs now. So the people who were entrepreneur now may start finding jobs as working professional. Some of them may be bought out by the big players, monopolization. But other entrepreneurs may start joining the working class again. Okay. Due to this, the middle class, the middle of which, the upper middle class was bought out by the bigger player. Lower middle class sinks into the proletariat. Middle class is completely finished. Only two classes remain. Okay. So if I explain this again, MARX is just saying this:
        - There is Bourgeoisie class.
        - There is Middle class (because he had to prove that middle class will be finished, it will not remain).
        - And third was Proletariat, the working class.
        - In this, MARX says, this middle class, in this middle class, the upper middle class is bought out by the industrialists during times of recession. And the lower middle class sinks in during recession. And this is how proletariat's size is expanding. This is called **proletarianization**. Okay. So proletarianization is happening with more and more people joining proletariat as they lose their, what do you say, jobs during recession. And upper middle class, since it is getting owned by, bought out by bourgeoisie, so this is forming monopolization. Okay. So this is happening. Fine. Proletarianization.
        - With recession the small and medium enterprises may lose market share, may be bought out by big players (this was called monopolization). Plus other small and medium players may sink in to join proletariat. Okay. This will be called proletarianization. Proletarianization means a process of expansion of the working class. Okay.
     7. Last contradiction, MARX says that eventually more technology is developed, and technology will be developed further at a higher end so that all inefficiencies in the setup are eliminated and profit can be made. The more tech you introduce, what happens eventually is the homogenization of the working class. Okay. The working class may not have any differences between them anymore. There may not be any upper skilled, semi skilled or unskilled. Everyone will be unskilled or everyone will be similarly skilled because everyone is replaced by machines. For this MARX gives a term: **Homogenization**. So as more and more technology is introduced all the workers would be looking almost same. There would be no difference between them, skilled, super skilled or unskilled with more and more technological intervention. Okay. So homogenization of working class with more technological innovation. Okay.
   - So these are some basic important inherent contradictions: homogenization, proletarianization. **Pauperization** is also the same, when people start losing their job, when they start becoming poor relative to what they were. Okay. And this idea where middle class is completely finishing, its lower section is going down, upper section is going up, MARX also gave a term for this: **Depression of Middle Class**.
   - So in your answer, not so many keywords, but some important keywords should be there, like homogenization, proletarianization, monopolization, recessionary conditions setting in. If you are explaining some four-five contradictions, it means you are explaining inherent contradictions. Don't just say that surplus value appropriation of worker happened. You need to be a little precise here when it comes to capitalism. This is very important mode of production. Okay. Fine.
   - And due to this what will happen? Eventually MARX assumed that because of these inherent contradictions (all that we studied was IC), capitalism will collapse. And who is the one to make capitalism collapse? Capital itself. Because it is only because of capital that people have become unemployed and they have joined reserve army. This reserve army will overthrow the industrialist class. Okay. So this is its inherent contradiction.

Now just a little bit I am telling you about Reserve Army. Alienation, I don't think I need to teach, I guess you all know that, there's nothing to tell in that. Okay. Reserve Army and Fetishism of Commodity, these two things I will tell you.

#### **Industrial Reserve Army (IRA)**

- You can write: **Reserve Army of Labor consists of unemployed, partially employed and under employed individuals.**

- The Reserve Army expands with conditions of recession. As recessionary conditions come, the volume of reserve army increases. Number of unemployed people will increase, number of under employed will also increase. Okay. With recession IRA increases. And when does this recession itself come? When we have overproduction and under consumption. Okay. Fine.

- Now IRA is not very homogenous in nature. IRA also has types, according to MARX. So now we will talk about the **Typology of Industrial Reserve Army**:
  
  1. **Floating Industrial Reserve Army**
  2. **Stagnant Industrial Reserve Army**
  3. **Latent Industrial Reserve Army**
  4. **Paupers**
  - These are the four types of reserve army. Okay. Let's define all four.
    1. **Floating**: The workers who are regularly displaced due to cyclical fluctuations, bankruptcies, failure of firms and technological innovations.
    2. **Stagnant**: Workers whose employment is seasonal or irregular, they are called stagnant form of reserve army.
    3. **Latent**: Workers displaced from agricultural sector due to capitalist development.
    4. **Paupers**: Paupers are those who are on the brink, even on the brink of the reserve army. Okay. Those on the brink of the working class are the reserve army. Those on the brink of the reserve army are paupers. So these are basically those people who are, you know, very dangerous classes. Like many of them become criminals, vagabonds. Okay. People who are living on the brink, whose job is not secured. They are working every minute to make their life secure. Okay. Many such people come in this. MARX calls them **Lumpenproletariat**.
       - Paupers who leave the reserve army and form dangerous classes of criminals, sex workers, beggars. Okay. They are also called Lumpenproletariat. Okay.

- Now the last point on this. So MARX used to say that existence of Industrial Reserve Army is actually helping the capitalist class. As long as we have so many people under employed or unemployed, so long the employed people may not bargain easily with the capitalist because they know that capitalist always have reserve class ready to replace them. So these people may not bargain with them easily. Okay. So existence of Industrial Reserve Army helps capitalist class in order to:
  
  1. First point, **keep the wages low**. For example, the unorganized sector acts like reserve army keeping wages low in the organized sector.
  2. Second point, it can help capitalist to ensure that **workers don’t demand better working conditions or form a union**. If workers demanded better working condition, formed a union, they will be replaced quickly, people from IRA will come. Okay. So this is the basic function.

- Now some scholars say in INDIA the IRA mainly consists of the minority, low caste, tribal, MUSLIMS and women. So there are different studies on this by some scholars like SURESH MEHROTRA who tell that INDIA's reserve army, i.e., the entire unorganized sector, if you see, who has the maximum representation in it? In it, the maximum representation is of women, tribal, minority, low caste. And in the organized sector, who has the maximum representation? HINDU upper caste man. Okay. Such typology has been made. So in INDIA the IRA is found to be consisting of women (women's maximum representation we know is in informal sector. Okay), low caste, tribes, minorities, etc. in unorganized sector. This is SURESH MEHROTRA's study.

- Then there is a theory which tells, it is a European theory, but you apply it in INDIA too, it is visible. The theory is **Feminist Theory on Reserve Army**. So feminist theory clearly says that major chunk of the reserve army is constituted by women. Because in all three forms of reserve army, unemployed, underemployed, partially employed, women are there. Maximum part time work, if anyone does, it is women. And maximum unemployed, if anyone is, it is also women. This means who is the biggest reserve army? Women. This is the feminist position. KARL MARX did not show as much concern for women in reserve army as he showed for lumpenproletariat, i.e., criminals, sex workers. But feminist theory focuses more on women in it.
  
  - Feminist Theory on IRA. In this, I will tell you the name of just one or two people, or just one. There is BEECHEY. She says women constitute the biggest chunk in reserve army. At all three levels: low paid (okay, instead of low paid, I will write under employed), unemployed, part time employed. And if you look at it form-wise too, floating form, stagnant form, there too you will see women, victim of fluctuations in market, again women. Okay. So in this you can include examples of how we see women are under employed, unemployed or part time employed when we look at glass ceiling, when we look at glass walls, or glass cliff, or when we see low education to women. In fact, GLOBAL GENDER GAP REPORT highlights this very thing. Okay. At least at the work level, if not politics, how under represented women are in comparison to men when it comes to work. Okay. Similarly, GLOBAL GENDER INEQUALITY REPORT, you can also quote that to show that women, if you compare it with men, how low representation do they have in work setup, be it private or public sector. Okay. To enhance that, you can mention steps here. Okay. How they are being absorbed, what policies government is bringing. Fine. So this will basically be finished. Fine.
  - One strand of feminist believes that the major chunk of reserve army is constituted by women. Okay. And that is very much visible when we talk about ceiling, wall and all those things. Okay. Informal sector, they have the maximum presence. But on the other hand, there is another stand in feminism which discards this idea. They say that women are not part of reserve army. In fact, women have become part of the well set up organized sector with expansion of service sector. As service sector is expanding, women are entering well organized, regularized, full time employment. Okay. Only because of expansion of service sector. This has happened in USA. And as and when we see expansion of service sector in other countries, we see more and more women leaving IRA and joining the full stream proletariat working class. Okay. So you can mention them too in your notes. Yes, CLAUDIA GOLDIN's study is also on this.
  - IRON BOUGAL simply says that women's representation in IRA has declined with expansion of service sector.

### **FETISHISM OF COMMODITY**

Okay, I will explain commodity fetishism. It's very basic, let's wrap it up quickly.

- First, we will write the simple basic definition: **When commodities assume super natural qualities external to the makers, this is regarded as Fetishism of Commodities.**
- Fetishism of commodity is when you assume that there is something special in the thing itself. In anything, I mean, whether you talk about any car like BMW, MERCEDES, or any watch like ROLEX, or any clothing like GUCCI, ARMANI, or any bag like LOUIS VUITTON. So you are giving importance to the product, neglecting the contribution of the maker of the car, maker of the cloth, maker of the jeans, maker of the perfume, maker of the clothing, maker of the perfume, maker of the bag. Okay. So you are giving more importance to the product, not to the producer.
- In the early times what used to happen was craftsmanship was given more importance. The craft made by craftman was given more importance. Today the brand has taken the place of craft man. Okay. So brand is becoming over and above the craft man. And the good is becoming over and above the producer. So and this when this happens this is not easily taking place unless the advertisement industry embellishes the good or the product with certain qualities that may leave you have more and more of them. Okay. So that desire is created so that the brand and good appear above the producer to you. Okay. So let's write a line.
- In capitalism the commodities are endowed with qualities like status, happiness, beauty, success, the identity of real man or woman.
- MARX believes that it is the work of the people which gives value to these commodities. It is the work of the people which give value to these commodities. But in capitalism we are focusing too much on commodities not on workers. Okay.
- The craftsmanship is dead. The craftsmanship and the recognition to craftsman is dead. And the dead labor has become more important than living labor. Dead labor means that finished good which has no life in itself, its identity has become more important. The living labor who made it, has no value. Okay. This is what MARX is saying, simply. Okay.
- **Examples**: Give examples of this from everyday life. Okay. There are three-four forms of examples. You can talk about phone industry, clothing industry. Okay. Yes, diamond, yes, jewelry industry. Yes, you can talk about that. So you can write two-three examples like this:
  1. **Designer Clothing Industry**: People believe that wearing designer clothes will make them more fashionable and they draw happiness from the same.
  2. **Luxury Watch Industry**: We are buying watches not to tell time but to display our status and success.
  3. **Smartphone Industry**: Yes, it is related to that. Okay. Smartphone industry. People upgrade to latest smartphone not because of improved features but because they want to be seen as up to date. Okay.
- This is the whole idea of fetishism of commodity. And this fetishism of commodity, if you look at it philosophically, is nothing but you have given an identity to the object, independent of the maker of the object. Okay. So this thing you see in many places. Nation has become independent of the people who make nation. Okay. People make nation but nation has become over and above people. Social fact we studied. People make family but family has become over and above the members of family. Okay. Similarly people made caste system but caste system has become over and above any of the individual. People make fest, fest becomes over and above people. People make object, object becomes over and above the producer. Okay. So when you start seeing, say okay. You can see that scholars later call this **reification**. When you reify structure, when you reify family, that means you have come to believe that family exists independently of us only. Okay. How can family be separate from us? I mean, we start believing that we didn't create family, it is separate from us. Okay. We didn't create nation, nation is separate from us, we start believing because we have come to reify nation. So MARX said people are reifying objects in capitalist society. They have come to believe that BMW has its own value irrespective of the makers. MERCEDES has its own value irrespective of the makers. Even though now many such articles keep coming, CHRISTIAN DIOR bag sells for lakhs, whereas its value is 50. Such things come up a lot. Okay. So that's it. Meaning, it has no value of its own. The value is of the workers. Eventually if workers lose the job they would not be purchasing the same. The value of the things may go down. Eventually MARX always used to say that the real value of the product comes from the producer. The product in itself does not have any value of its own. Okay. But when we start believing the product to be having its own independent value that means we are fetishizing. Okay.

### **PYQs (MARX)**

Now I am just giving you two questions, do them and then you can go. Okay. If you are not able to do any question of KARL MARX, in case we haven't studied it, like alienation we haven't studied because you will be able to do it, that's why we didn't study it. Okay. So you can tell me if you are not able to do any question.
Class struggle, do I need to explain class in itself, class for itself? No need, right? If you have any doubt, ask me then.

Complex Society: Complex DOL (specialization), Organic Solidarity (interdependence), Restitutive Law.                                                                                                                  |
|               | - Anomie                               | - Moral disruption, unregulated desires during transition (Simple -> Complex). Causes: Economic boom/bust, natural disasters, tech disruption. Abnormal DOL: Forced (ascription > merit), Anomic (social capital > merit), Inadequately Coordinated. Role of State: Embodiment of morality.                      |
| **KARL MARX** | **Historical Materialism**             | - HEGEL (Dialectical Idealism: ideas primary) vs. MARX (Dialectical Materialism: material conditions primary). Base (economy, ruling class) determines Superstructure (ideas, institutions). Assumptions: Man as working being, ideas by ruling class, economy as base.                                          |
|               | - Salient Features                     | - Material needs -> Social relations of production -> Means of Production (tools, tech, labor) -> Ownership by ruling class -> Superstructure justifies -> Inherent contradictions -> Class struggle (motor of history).                                                                                         |
|               | - Relevance/Critique                   | - Relevant: UBI demands, social security, gig worker rights, women's work, global inequality. Not So Relevant: Middle class expansion, trade unions, non-homogenous working class.                                                                                                                               |
|               | **Mode of Production (MOP)**           | - Way society organizes production. Elements: Means of Production, Relations of Production. Evolution via dialectics (inherent contradictions).                                                                                                                                                                  |
|               | - Stages & Contradictions              | - Primitive Communism (collective -> private ownership). Ancient/Slave (master/slave exploitation -> revolt). Feudal (land-based decline, enclosure, migration).                                                                                                                                                 |
|               | - Capitalism's Inherent Contradictions | - Overproduction for profit (waste). Exchange value > Use value (commodities). Labor cost cuts (machines -> IRA). Recession (overproduction + under-consumption). Monopolization. Proletarianization & Depression of Middle Class. Homogenization of working class. Collapse inevitable.                         |
|               | **Industrial Reserve Army (IRA)**      | - Unemployed, partially employed, underemployed. Expands with recession. Typology: Floating, Stagnant, Latent, Paupers (Lumpenproletariat). Function: Keeps wages low, prevents worker demands. Composition: Minorities, women (Feminist view: women are largest chunk; some argue decline with service sector). |
|               | **Fetishism of Commodity**             | - Commodities assume supernatural qualities external to makers. Focus on product > producer (craftsmanship dead). Dead labor > Living labor. Endowed with status, happiness via ads. Reification. Examples: Designer clothes, luxury watches, smartphones.                                                       |
