## SOCIOLOGY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Irving Zeitlin**: socio was reaction to enlightenment (**ideology and dev of sociological theory**)
- Socio helps us not only to be more analytical but also understand individuals, groups and institutions around us as well as their interaction with each other
- Europe 3 phases of modernity
    - Dark age -> religious and God centric (no logic)
    - Emerged in response to **social and intellectual climate of Europe**
    - Sociology the Product of clash between enlightenment (individuals) and counter enlightenment ideas (society at core)
    - Enlightenment refers to the intellectual movement concerned with governance and economy
    - Dark ages and Era of enlightenment (intellectual movement) -> ideological modernity – **13-17 century**
    - Focus on humanism – human centric lifestyle. **INDIVIDUALISM empricisim and rationality**
    - **Led by**
        - **Voltaire** – free speech
        - **Hobbes** and **Locke** – natural rights – life, liberty and property
        - **Rousseau** – general will (will of majority) + every one had one vote
        - **Marry Wollstonecraft** – life liberty and property for gender equality
        - **Adam Smith** – free market economy – laissez faire and invisible hand + progressive taxation + specialization and DOL
        - **Montesquieu** (separation of power and const)
    - Renaissance – rebirth driven by new thinking – upheaval of art, architecture, ideas, literature
    - French rev – political modernity – rule of law and citizenship – 18 century – liberal democracy and concept of republic
    - Industrial rev – technological modernity – An era which involved mass production, factory system and standardization of production
        - Led to separation of work and home (**sexual DOL**) and time based production + efficiency + bureaucracy
    - Scientific revolution -> **Copernicus** – hello centric theory and **Kepler** – elliptical theory
    - Modernity refers to departure from tradition driven by intellectual forces and characterized by individualism, equality, humanism, democracy, free market, nation state and empiricism

### Emergence of Socio
- Counter enlightenment -> involved questioning the French, industrial and enlightenment. These have disturbed social order and caused lawlessness or anarchy. 2 groups emerged – modernist and conservatives / skeptics (Modernists romance with modernity); these were judgmental so a group emerged to take a balanced approach and study modernity
    - Crime rates , suicide, homelessness, divorce, reign of terror (**August Comte**, **E Durkhiem**, **Louis de Bonald** conservatives against enlighternment)
    - Man was no longer the owner of the product (alienation) + slum formation + economic inequality (**Karl Marx** radical)
    - Feudal to industrial society; capitalism, nation state, bureaucracy, change in household and kinship, middle class, Economic and cultural upheaval + social stratification with emergence of **nobility, clergy and commoners**
- Critiscism – **Bottomore** – encyclopedic and radical
    - Intellectual antecedents influenced socio incl.
        - philosophy of history (society progressed through stages of evolutions eg **Karl Marx** dialectical materialism, **Spencer’s** organismic theory)
        - biological philosophy
        - social survey – methods of natural sciences to socio eg poverty
        - social reform movement
        - rise of feminism and thought
- modernity is not homogenous and of varied nature. Assuming as only place is equal to colonization of modernity
- **SN Eisenstadt** -> multiple modernity such as Indian modernity (**Yogendra Singh** caste based political party, Indian secularism which is equidaistant, Indian socialism, Russian and Chinese socialism/ communism, SE Asian – satellite capitalism + hub for import/ export), dependent modernity of Latin America
    - India – caste based political parties; indian secularism, DPSP and social welfare
    - Bhutanic modernity green growth and happiness index
    - Chinese Russian – one party political modernity
    - Latin America – language modernity but traditional economy
- Hence modernity is a universal phenomena
- Chicago school issues – racism, orphanage for children and elderly, hunger and malnutrition, gender equality at workplace -> **Jane Addams** + **Du Bois** (Black men living dual consciousness – established hull house) -> had social reformist orientation
    - **Micheal Burawoy** – public sociology
    - **Schwendinger and Schwendinger**: early American sociologists were political liberals
    - Class and harmony cooperation
    - Majorly civil war after civil war
    - **Furnham**: Americans saw positive possibility of industrialization, but also aware of danger; Europeans were reactionary
    - **Stanford**: heavily influenced by Protestantism, which led to view socio can be interested in social reforms
    - **Veblen**: leisure class foster wasteful consumption
    - **Robert Park** – Chicago school – go to field and get data
    - Later America socio – melting pot socio, **Berger**, **Parsons**, **Luckman**
- Frankfurt school – **Adorno**, **Bauman** emphasized departure from core principles of enlightenment
- **Conclusion** – Hence, existing disciplines couldn’t answer societal changes and hence socio emerged as the “science of society”

### Early Thinkers
- So initiated with roman civilization – had a “city state” where political consolidation and progressive society; however, non -propsperous city states aged war
- Conquerors declared themselves as kings – barbaric state started
- Now people were miserable and needed help – church emerged with pope and bishop to advice the king
- But king paid off bishop and priestly class became agents of God
- Books against church came
    - **Thomas More** – **Utopia** - questioned church and the concept of after life
    - **Montaigne** – **What do I know** – humans have ltd knowledge and so do church about religion
    - **Rene Descartes** – I think and therefore I exist
    - **David Hume** – every religion glorifies body of miracles – those who benefit from it promote it
    - **John Locke** – man by nature is rational (establish a relation between means and goal) + initiated rule of law and separation of power
    - **Calvin** and **Martin Luther** – god has created both paradise and earth. So earth is equally sacred as paradise
- early thought of **Darwin’s** organismic evolution theory – imp influence on socio
- **Comte** – founder of socio - scientific discipline
- **Simon** – ethical socialism
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 1.png>)
- Counter enlightenment ideas also
- **Durkheim** - when an old society is disintegrating, it has a transition period where some people follow traditional vs other follow modern elements; so no unanimity ; need reforms

**_Intellectual forces_**: Changes incl eco (industrial), social, political (French)
- _Black ages Dawn of modernity challenges quest for ans_

### Scope of Socio
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 2.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 3.png>)
- **MOTHER OF ALL SOCIAL SCIENCES**
- Not first discipline – historians collected data in specific format
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 4.png>)
- No real consensus on scope of socio
- Started with a macro view (**Comte**), evolved to micro (**Weber**), further dynamic to synthetic
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 5.png>)
- **Sprott**: brave attempt to confine mass of slippery material into simple system of pigeonholes
- Influenced By Science
- Influenced by social philosophy
- 3 approaches – inductive, synthetic, formal
    - Inductive – empirical approach
        - **Comte** – socio is the mother of all sciences
        - **Comte** – social positivism – **SOCIAL STATISTICS AND DYNAMICS**
        - **Spencer** – organismic
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 6.png>)
    - Synthetic
        - French sociologist believed socio can study anything and everything
        - Called synthetic tradition of sociology – can study anything and everything
        - **Durkheim** – 3 parts of socio – social morphology (pop related aspect), social physiology (bodily parts of society such as family), general socio (develop theories)
        - **HOBHOUSE** – all other disciplines should come and merge with socio
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 7.png>)
    - Grand theories to explain cause effect relationships
    - **Karl Mannheim** – 2 types of socio - general socio and historical socio – but has problem of comparison and socio dynamic
    - Scope of socio is limitless
    - Suffers from sociocentrism
    - Mutual exchange and mutual stimulation
- Formal – pure and independent; focus on micro elements , SUOR
    - German school which recognizes the limitations of socio due to the subject matter of the study
    - Say socio is branch of social science
    - Has its own methodology
    - Socio is not the queen, rather diff from other social sciences
    - **George Simmel** – human behavior can be classified as formal behavior and actual behavior
    - Social life is dynamic
    - **Tonnies**, **Weber**, **Simmel**
- **Parsons** and **Merton** – combined (SOSA and latent manifest)
- Post modernists – reject meta-narratives
    - Socio evolved from positivism to here due to diff schools of thought
    - **Micheal Focault** – alternate institutions like old age, prison + health, ageing
    - **Anthony Giddens** - Double Hermeneutics i.e. everyday lay concepts and of social sciences have a 2 way relationship
    - **Alan Bryman** – hallmark of post modernist sociology is “purposive sociology” iei pluralist methodology based on the need of subject matter
    - **Zygmunt Bauman**
- Contemporary – gives importance to envt, women, public policy
    - In global times – climate change, new forms of kinship
    - Evolved from merely Eurocentisim
    - Man on earth, not just one nation
    - Role of social media
    - Deviance and anomie rising crime
    - Suicides from edu
    - New forms of marriage
    - Digital sociology

### CRITICISM
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 8.png>)
- **Maciver and Page** _– society is a web of relationships_

## HISTORY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Radcliffe Brown** – history is Idiographic vs socio is normative
- Specific vs generic
- Similarity vs difference
- Descriptive vs analytical
- FOCUS IS ON HOW EVENT HAPPENED VS CAUSE OF EVENT
- History is factual, socio is analytical
- archival research, content analysis, and comparative historical analysis to
- Historical sociology as a branch ->
    - Origin and evolution of social institution – origin of family (hoarder to patriarchal monogamous) or religion (animism and naturism) / Indology/ Orientalist
    - Generalization based on historical event - Used by **Marx**, **Durkheim**, **Weber**, Indology
- **GE Howard** – history is past socio, socio is present history
- Socio w/o history is rootless, history wo socio is fruitless
- Subaltern study – study mass from lens of masses eg women, queers
    - Devi movement – in Guj – Sanskritization of tribals at grassroot level so no land reform by mass for mass – no charismatic leader
    - Study of dasi in vedic times
    - Pagal panthi movement

## ECONOMICS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- economics focuses on the **economic aspects, such as market structures,** resource allocation, and financial systems
- Different –
    - Scope
    - methodology (quant vs qualitative)
    - not concerned with impact of MOP (or how much is being produced) – like **Marx**
    - inequality not explained
    - Narrow and laws vs deductive and nuanced
    - Can make not make theories
    - Eco considers human as rationality maximiser who is rational – called **homo economicus** whereas socio considers human as a social being who make decisions based on social norms and institutions
    - Eg – occupation due to social, religious, geo factors studied by socio and not eco (like bamboo ceiling)
    - Eg – anticipatory socialization, romantic ethics, cascading effect
    - Esp for new middle class
- **Alfred Marshall**
- **Durkheim** – DOL + socio and co have diff approach but same topic of research
- **Karl Marx** – change is social superstructure due to change in eco infra
- **Taylorism**, **Fordism**
- **Weber** – socio explains in economics what eco cant by giving a holistic view
- Related – welfare economics, impact analysis, outcome analysis, gender budgeting, tribal sub plan
- **Parsons** – eco and socio are totally inseparable from each other - > socio deals with study of eco behavior of man
- **Veblen** – socio concepts used by economists such as leisure class
- **Adam Smith** – market is non discriminatory and sacred
- Spending is driven by norms and culture of society -> eg marriage; so actual spending based on culture and not spending capacity
- Eg – leather industry for brahmins – tannering industry
- Eg – manuak scavengers as lower caste

## POL SCIENCE
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Pol science is the branch of natural science concerned with state institutions, political behavior, thoughts, governance and power
- Differences between the two
    - Traditional P focused on state and power whereas asll aspects
    - More concerned with the end result whereas focus on why such result is being achieved
    - Makes policy whereas provides base to make the policy
- Politics and socio are 2 branches of socio science which have stark overlap, but minute differences at the same time
- **Catlin** – pol science and socio 2 faces and aspects of same figure
- Political sociology
    - Social factors underlying distribution of power -> gender, caste, religion, class
    - Health of democracy and diff socio regimes – V-Dem report (variety of democracies)
    - **Weber** – bureaucracy
    - **Marx**
    - **Psephologist** - studies how people vote in elections
    - Pol science affects socio – one child
    - Socio affects pol – voting pattern, caste, community
    - **Plato** and his men of gold, silver, iron
    - **Aristotle** and citizenship
    - **Rousseau** and general will
    - **Locke** and rule of law
    - **Mills** – elite theory
    - **Pareto** – fox and lions and elite circulation
    - Critical theory – rejects between democracy and socialism as both dominate the subjects and term Naxalites
    - Hegemony

## PSYCHOLOGY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- From v advet tried to dissacoiate itself
- P focuses on human behavior at an individual level vs at a societal level
- 3 theories
    - **Durkheim** - different
    - Utilitarian phenomenology interaction – celebration of psycho
        - **JS Mill** – law of mind base of all socio -> there is no collective; every collective is product of individual
        - **McDougall** and **Freud** – whole social life reduced to psychological; factors – hence socio a psychology branch
    - Abalysis of social structure and impact of social factors vs mind and its actions
    - Sociological imagination vs individual traits
    - **Weber** – complementary as explains underlying behaviour
    - Individual vs collective behavior
    - Generalization vs unique context
    - Experimental vs empirical
- Complementary
    - Social psychology eg **Merton** reference group theory and anticipatory socio
    - Status and role ->
        - Status - position with duties and rights
        - Role - Set of expectation from that position (eg depression due to unemployment)
    - **Cooley** – looking glass self
    - **Parsons** – enriches socio – motivation oriented social actions as well as affective role of a mother
    - **Weber** – interpretivist and need to focus on understanding of social actor -> reciprocal of each other
    - **Durkheim** – celebration of socio – considered suicide not psychological but social-> suicide not psychological but social concept
    - **Marx** – alienation
    - **Merton** – self fulfilling prophecy and relative deprivation theory

## PHILOSOPHY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Socio evolved with strong philosophical orientation
- Socio raises philosophical questions
- Sociologists use philosophy to make theories and explain social change
- Develop concepts and ideas
- Natural philosophy cant be called a science because true science is social philosophy – **Locke**

## ANTHRO
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Understand past humans to analyze evolution, culture, social characteristics that make that culture
- Conflict theory and structural functionalism unique to socio
- Past vs future
- Stay vs observe
- Primitive vs post industrial societies
- Out of curiosity vs social change
- Eurocentric
- Social anthropology - > modernization of village or assimilation of tribe into mainstream culture
- **MNS** – took field study (inspired by **Malinowski**) + **William Whyte**
- **Spencer** evolutionary theory
- Diff stages of evolution eg
- Studies social structures over time
- Comparative socio same as cultural anthro
- **Kroeber** – Anthro and socio are twin sisters
- Hence – borrowing from other disciplines for a multi-disciplinary and integrated for holistic overview of social complexities

## COMMON SENSE
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Some say socio is diff from common sense; other say common sense closer to reality
- Common sense is shared knowledge
- **Weber** – routine knowledge of our everyday world and activities
- **Alfred Schutz's** phenomenological sociology, where it refers to organized and 'typified' stocks of taken-for-granted knowledge upon which activities
- Empirical, based on assumptions and presumption eg galileo and science (earth rotates around sun)
- Status quoist, social revolution
- Deeper insights vs prejudice
    - **Peter Berger** – debunking attitude to understand levels of reality in society vs what appears on surface
- Based on beliefs and culture, based on objective analysis
- Based on imagination, ignorance, prejudice
- Establish cause and effect relationship and developing theories
- Socio collected data on people life and questioned methods of society
- Local and temporal vs universal eg Somoa island women hard wired – common sense but not true for other places
- Assumptions vs evidence
- Intitutive vs objective
- Common sense – we don’t find pattern in seemingly diff things whereas common patterns in seemingly diff events (eg similarity in caste and race)
- For failure – we put blame on individual vs understand external factors causing influence (sociological imagination)
- Use examples where common sense diff than socio – eg > married men and single men, suicide (psychological), higher caste more meritorious (observational) and poor as they are not qualified, but actually closed stratification and elite rule,
- Common sense perspectives: 1. Biological – women have maternal instinct; but **Mead’s** theory in “**Sex and temperament in three primitive societies**” reveals not universal
- mad people more delinquent vs white collar crime (white collar more – **Sutherland**)
- women more emo than men whereas conclude role of family and media in shaping gender
- Related – vocabulary (eg vote bank and role model) , hypothesis , common sense challenges socio – dynamically evolving
- In renaissance, common sense died
- Death of common sense leads to scientific society
- Make your model of reality
- Help in getting qualitative data eg – capitalism
- Not understand socio research otherwise
- Develop ideal type
- Helps in understanding socio theories
- Socio questions common sense eg religion **Durkheim**
- **Locke** – sensory organ is collecting data and when it is filtered through a rational mind, people look at the data with diff perception
- **Beckers** – labelling theory of sociology becomes common sense
- **Gramsci** – cultural hegemony of elite become common sense
- Refine common sense like vote bank, anticipatory socio (act like actor)
- No gospel truths, hence multiple interpretations of society need to be accepted and common sense is an integral part to develop that unerstabding
- **CW Mills** and sociological imagination
    - SI as a tool to study social, external forces shape individual’s life
    - An ability to explain social forces governing individual life
    - He described 2 terms – personal issue (biography) and public issue (history)
        - Bio – a document on individual life
        - History – past or recent events
    - But everything is a public issue and nothing is a personal issue
    - Eg – crime and crime rate (**Merton** strain theory between culturally defined goals and socially available means), suicide and suicide rate (based on societal solidarity), divorce and divorce rate (service sector means financial indepdence for women)
    - Socio imagination study rates and not actions
    - These will depend on type of society and group membership
    - Study external force instead
    - Eg – sex ratio is skewed in Punjab and Haryana (bio); why? History -> Green rev + legalization of abortion + ultrasound tech -? led to individuals skewed sex ratio
        - Hence it is combining bio with history
    - Suicide of individual -> history of society (modern or old) ; martyr vs competitiveness and isolation in modern societies
    - **Merton** – American dream led to 1940 se increasing suicide
    - Biography may also be read to study history such as **Annie Frank**

### CRITICISM
- Post modernist – socio of today is common sense of tomorrow; not superior
- Phenomoneologist – focus on what people do

## SOCIO AS A DISCIPLINE
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Interdisciplinary approach – combine 2 disciples and integrating them
- Multi disciplinary – combine 2 or more without necessarily integrating these disciplines – eg Climate change analyzed by environmentalists, economists (how much to contribute), politicians (intl conventions), sociologists (LDC waste of developed), psychology (irrational decisions)

## SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Scientific method is a logical and systematic method with steps to conduct scientific enquiry
    - Topic selection eg domestic abuse
    - Problem definition eg why – narrowed the problem
    - Preliminary research and existing literature review
    - Develop hypothesis – untested assumption
    - Operationalize variables in hypothesis ie explain the meaning of the variable
    - Choose research method – survey interview/ observation etc
    - Data collection and check validity and reliability of data
    - Analyze, Generalization and publish – hypothesis approve or refute
- Critique of science and scientific method
    - Multicausality in social world; however restrict variables
    - Inter mixture of cause and effect -> poverty and alcoholism
    - Difficult to quantify the data
    - Difficult to establish reliability
    - **Karl Popper** – many statements and hypothesis in social science are not falsifiable and hence not scientific
        - Eg **Freud’s** 3 layers in cognition – ID, ego, superego
        - **Karl Marx** – said fully developed society like Europe will be first place to have communist revolution. This is falsifiable . but revolution is not coming because people are living in false consciousness is not falsifiable
    - **Paul Feyerbend** – in reality, many scientists are not going with scientist method, rather dream experiences, assumptions or chance experiments (**Madam Curie** chance experiment)
    - **Thomas Kuhn** – science undergoes paradigm shift where one theory is replaced by another but however in science, there is always one dominant paradigm. In social world, there is no one dominant paradigm and hence socio is not mature science but young science

## POSITIVISM AND CRITIQUE (OTHER THEORETICAL SCHOOLS)
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Positivism – cause and effect relationship that can be observed to define fixed laws of society such as in natural sciences. Philosophy which considers society exists like a natural system with inst such as family, state, law etc and has natural laws
- Features - **TOCQI**
- Assumes society exists naturally out there
- They will objectively collect data
- Finds correlation between variables and develops causal grand theories (generalization)
- It believes social world to be driven by single cause (mono causal)
- Try to predict behaviour
- Focus only on observable facts and considers other factors such as motivations ad meanings as inconsequential
- **Comte** defined positivism in 2 ways:
    - As a doctrine (a philosophy) or as a method (research methodology)
- Science – organized body of knowledge where facts are inter-connected to each other on basis of which conclusion are established
- Features of socio as a science (**TOQI**)
    - Empirical
    - Based on theory
    - Objective
    - Testable
    - Use scientific methods
    - Use deductive approach and empiricism
    - Reliability and replicability
- Then why socio is science – positivism
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 9.png>)
- Definition, Features, example
- How **Weber** concludes socio as science
    - **Weber** – socio is science as far as concerned with study of social actions, its causes and consequences objectively
        - What makes interpretive socio scientific -> qualitative data in a value-neutral manner
        - Social world by causal probabilism as there is one necessary cause eg – protestant ethics was a necessary cause
        - Every interpretivist socio accepts that they cant study the world as is; so study the model of social world (ideal type)
- Anti positivist
    - **Karl Popper** – 2 types of disciplines – pseudo science (theory is verifiable) and science (falsifiable)
        - Eg – suicide theory is verifiable but not fasifiable as solidarity makes sense but not falsifiable
    - **Thomas Kuhn** – young science and mature science; socio is a young science as multiple and single paradigm
        - Truth Is relative and based on the dominant paradigm
        - Eg – capitalism **Marx** vs **Weber**
    - Ethno and pheno – social world is illusion
    - **Horkheimer** – conservative and status quoist
    - **Peter Berger** – “sociology of everyday life” – humans are not puppets who react blindly to external stimulus but create their own reality + social facts don’t fall from the sky but develop in a particular context
    - study in many ways -> **Merton** with his mid range theories
- **Sayer** – socio may have predictions which are not always valid but it doesn’t mean its not science, it is as much science as seismology ; open science
- In concl, socio in its nascent stage was ambitious to gain a scientific status, but later started studying science sociologically
- Non positivists
    - Interpretivists -> consider social world consisting of meanings and motivations of individuals
        - Study the social action of individual (SA – any action which is meaningly and intentional in a social context)
        - Collect qualitative data, meaning and motivations
        - Eg – intention behind divorce , experience of prosperity and poverty
        - Value neutrality should be maintained
        - Data collection by verstehen
        - Multi causality – no single phenomena but understand causal probabilism (one necessary cause but other sufficient causes)
    - Phenomenology –branch of interpretivist sociology which considers social world and the knowledge about it, as a social construction ie. social world consists of subjective experiences and meanings of individuals
        - Influenced by **Weber’s** theory of attaching meanings at a micro level- where meanings don’t have independent existence but reconstucted by actor in their social interactions
        - Tries to explain what role human awareness plays in social actions. The focus is to explain the meaning of phenomena instead of how they came in to existence
        - Meanings are not fixed and hence there cant be an objective fact
        - Every meaning depends on context (called indexicality)
        - Human beings attach meaning to phenomena in not a mental action but based on some “typifications (good bad, moral immoral) and depends on culture which finally creates social reality -> no objective idea (**Alfred Shutz** in his **phenomenology of the social world**)
            - This was in contrast to **Edmund Husserl** who claimed classification of phenoema was a purely product of human mind
        - Purely qualitative data collected to understand diff objects, events, inst, object etc
        - Despite each ind having diff world view and meanings, social world/ order exists only because all of us have commonly agreed over few things
        - Eg marriage in Bihar (pakadhwa) vs church wedding in US
        - But even social order commonly agreed between members is also an illusion and not objective facts
        - Bracketing is a methodological tool used in phenomenology.
        - eg – data on crime , poverty (poverty rates diff by diff committees), exports -> opinion of investigator and not objective
        - questions even official data eg – GDP change base year
        - _P is required to explicate (explain) the concept which positivists take as granted in order to measure them (**Hussrel**)_
        - Eg – **Cicourel’s** study of juvenile justice ; police and juvenile officers had the problem of classifying the behaviour of juveniles into the categories: delinquent and non-delinquent. **Cicourel** did not find this process to be objective: it largely depended on the stereotypes of the ‘typical delinquent’ held by the official
        - Criticism – questions v existence of socio + too susbjective and common sensical
    - Extra
        - **Peter Berger** and **Thomas Luckmann** – no reality other than subjective reality of individuals
        - **Gabrielle Farina** in her “**Some reflections on the phenomological method**” – it is nether a docrine nor a philosophical school but a style of thought where investigator can have different experiences and results each time
        - Create theories
        - Enhance research methods
        - **Shutz**: positivism not considered with socio but made out of socio
    - Ethno – **Harold Garnfienkel** – study from people perspective and not investigator perspective using a documentary
        - Phenological research to explain how members create order in society
        - There are socially constructed rules of everyday interaction.
        - Members of society are repeatedly performing these rules and maintain social order (Document of Rules)
        - But the social order is an illusion
        - **Garfinkel** introduced “Breaching experiment” to prove illusion -> disrupt the social order and record the reaction of members
        - On recording the reaction of members, it is found members become desperate to restore the original social order, which shows that social order is not naturally out there but a construction of the members following the rules of everyday interaction
        - Lodger experiment – ask mom for food bill
        - Focus on what people do instead of what people think as in P
        - Critique – labelled as traditional or folk methodology
        - **Alvin Gouldner** – E focused on trivial aspects of life which everyone is aware of
    - Symbolic interactionism – **GH Mead** and **Herbert Blumer**
        - Philosophy that explains social world as a set of symbols exchanged between members
            - Humans are endowed with cognitive thought/ cognition
            - Cognitive though is developed through social interaction
            - Social interaction involves exchange of signs, symbols, gestures
            - Meanings behind everything are created and shared through language
            - Social order is possible only because of exchange of symbols and mutually agreed meaning of symbols
            - Eg – unfurling flag or burning flag
    - Dramaturgy – by **Goffman** – philosophy which explains socio world is a theatre and members are performers
        - Each member performs a role in everyday life
        - Role is performed acc to status
        - Role performance is done in front stage
        - Members prepare for role keeping expectation of audience
        - Member is ideal in back stage
        - Every member resort to role distance is to be taken seriously in some context (sometimes become informal – off script)
        - Every member is doing impression mgt
        - Eg – Delta airlines -> air hostess offers service + smile (emotional labour concept)
- Post positivism
    - Philosophy which critiques and refines positivism -> doesn’t reject
    - Quanti + quali data -> eg – unemployment rate plus experience
    - Researcher has some value as they are also humans
    - Quantitative method of research eg survey + qualitiatve method such as interview (esp unstructured)
    - Triangulation method
    - **Karl Popper** + **Thomas Kuhn**

- Example
    - Correlation -> racism leads to discrimination and poverty
    - Interpretisvist: why racism and how does It make them feel

## CRITICAL THEORY/ CONFLICT THEORY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Branch of socio that considers society not a natural state but a social construct created by the dominant group (patterns of inequality created by few dominant groups)
- will collect data to expose anomalies in society and advocate change in society
- quanti data but quali change eg **Ambedkar**
- 2 groups – Marxists and feminists
- Marxists – economy is the basic structure -> social world characterized by eco infra defines social superstructure
    - Base of eco changes due to changes in production – means and tech; few groups command ownership as tech changes and masses work for those few
- Eg – **Harvey** and his study on exploitative role of social objects
    - **Ken Plummer** – study of transsexualism -> need for equality
- **DEPENDENCY**, **SUBALTERN**, **MARXISTS**, **FEMINISTS**
- Any research done by/ for/ of women. Focus on gender inequality but also advocate change through policy formulation or activism
- Features
    - Preference to women experience about their working or domestic life
    - Pref to qualitative data like unstructured interview, case study, etc
    - Preference to building rapport with research subject eg **Ann Oakley** studied experience of women in transition to motherhood
    - Time taking process
    - Advocates intersectionality (eg Dalit women most exploited); black/ muslim/ dalit or combination of each
    - **Kimberley Crenshaw** – developed the intersectionality approach
    - Aim to create social change either by movement, policy advocacy or reforms at intl level
    - Mainstream is male stream research -> aim to de-masculinise and feminize malestream research
    - Eg – **Ann Oakley** conducted detailed study on women experience to motherhood using qualitative research method like unstructured interview
    - Eg – **Claudia Goldin**
- Features of Critical social research:
    1. Abstract concepts and ideology: Critical social research use abstract concepts such as housework, but
    goes beyond simply carrying out empirical studies based on such concepts.
    o Critical research tries to get beneath the surface of social reality. Distorted ideological beliefs may
    be related to dominant classes or to patriarchal or racist beliefs.
    o They mask the material reality that lies behind these beliefs. But critical social research involves
    trying to overcome the dominant ideology or ideologies.
    2. Totality, structure and history: Each abstract concept and particular belief cannot be examined in
    isolation. According to **Harvey** it is necessary to relate each bit of a society to a totality.
    o **Harvey** says: Totality refers to the view that social phenomena are interrelated and form a total
    whole.
    o Critical social scientists see societies as possessing structures. Structures constrain or limit what
    people can do, but also make social actions possible. Structures, though, are not static; they
    change.
    o Studies of society therefore need to be related to particular historical contexts. One needs to
    examine how particular societies have changed over time in order to understand them at any
    particular point in time.
    3. Deconstruction, essence and reconstruction: Critical social researchers proceed through a process of
    deconstruction and reconstruction.
    o In the process of deconstruction, the different elements of particular areas of social life are taken
    apart in order to try to discover an essence. The essence is the 'fundamental concept that can be
    used as the key to unlocking the deconstructive process'.
    o Reconceptualization - thinking of familiar aspects of social life in unfamiliar ways - is the key to
    discovering essences through deconstruction. This process is never finished. The process of
    deconstruction does not follow a pre-set path, as laid down by, for example, positivists.
    o Deconstruction leads to reconstruction. The researcher aims in the end to 'lay bare the essential
    relationships that are embedded in the structure'. They develop theoretical insights that allow the
    phenomena under investigation to be seen in a new way.
    4. Praxis: Critical social research is not just a theoretical activity; it is also a form of praxis.
    o **Harvey** defines praxis as 'practical reflective activity. Praxis does not include "instinctive" or
    "mindless" activity like sleeping, breathing, walking, and so on, or undertaking repetitive work
    tasks. Praxis is what changes the world."
- For Marxists, subject matter is peasants, poor, vulnerable, marginalized
- The concept of hegemony, originally developed by **Antonio Gramsci**, refers to the ideological and cultural
- dominance of the ruling class over subordinate classes. **Stuart Hall** extended **Gramsci’s** concept of hegemony to analyze the role of media in shaping
- popular consent and legitimizing the interests of the ruling class. He argued that the media
- constructs a “common sense” worldview that aligns with the dominant ideology.
- **Louis Althusser** argued that the ruling class maintains its hegemony through ideological state
- apparatuses (**ISAs**), such as schools, media, and religious institutions

## RESEARCH
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Longitudinal study – removes bias, comparative analysis, preferred by feminist as emotional bond, higher validity
    - Criticism – hawthorne study + lesser reliability + participation observation challenge like **MNS** + investigator bias
    - Helps in objserving cause effect relation (incl plurastic probability) and even make generalization and theory
    - Imp for ethnigoraphic accounts

## OBJECTIVITY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Quality of researcher to keep investigation free from bias, opinion and personal value/ prejudice, value and subjective interpretation
- Borrowed from natural sciences and Was colonized by positivists for the longest time i.e quantitative data as the symbol of good research
- However **Weber** questioned in his book “**Objectivity in social sciences**” and redefined objectivity in his work
    - Value neutrality: Collect Qualitative data in a value neutral manner
    - Vale relevance: every researcher is opinionated and hence should declare his/ her values right at onset of research (tell why)
    - Causal probabilism: multiple causes but necessary sufficient eg protestant
    - Ideal type : no absolutely objective scientific analysis of social phenomena independent of one sided view points. Every researcher has one sided understanding of social world which only explains his model of world. He should clearly state that he is only studying model of the world
- **Robert Bierstedt** – defines objectivity as conclusions derived from investigation are independent of race, caste, colour, nationality and political predisposition of investigator
- Multiple sources of subjectivity incl
    - Choice of topic and problem definition . **Weber** argues subjectivity can be tolderated at this level in his book “**MOSS**”
    - Question to be answered in research
    - Research methodology deployed by investigator
    - Interpretation of the investigation data analysis – **Oscar Lewis** and **Robert Redfield** in Tepostaton both observed Mexico – **RR** functional approach and harmony; Marxist approach and conflict
    - Subjectivity in certain research methodologies and empirical data collection itself like qualitative interviews, participant observation and non participation observation (prejudice) eg – feminists suggest supporting the interviewee
    - CHOICE OF testing tools
    - Challenges in data collection – **Andre Beteille** not allowed in Sripuram village
        - **William Whyte** – from non participant observer to participant non observer
- Has been explained by multiple thinkers incl
    - **Max Weber** in his – value free research via ideal types
    - **Durkheim** in his “**Rules of sociological method**” – consider social facts as things
- Other safegurads
    - Clearly lay down bias
    - Use spatial and temporal dimensions
    - Focus on testing and reflexivity
    - Double blind in research
    - Larger sample
    - Temporal and wider applicability research
- Difficiult to achieve objectivity as
    - **Dilthey** – a fact based approach focuses on one dimension and ignores other cultural ideological dimensions
    - Phenomenologists like **Shutz** – subject matter has consciousness and **Hussrel** – socio research can not be value free
    - **Gunnar Myrdal** - - total objectivity is an illusion which can never be achieved
    - Also, lose reformist agenda
    - **Alvin Gouldner** – Value neutrality is an elusive goal in sociology as investigators have to deal with multiple layer truth
- Hence desirable yet elusive goal with its own limitations due to the unique subject matter of socio which possesses consciousness . deploy most objective research methods for meaningful results

### CRITICISM
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 17.png>)

## THEORY AND FACTS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Traditionally, facts and theory have often been summarized as diametrically contrasting dimensions of sociology with facts focusing on observable, verifiable data whereas theories being abstract social imaginations and hypothesis
- But invalid
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 15.png>)Intertwined – facts are verified theories based on a hypothesis whereas theories guide the research methodology for data collection to emerge as facts as well as summarize the relationship between different social facts and observations in a meaningful way
- Theory helps in
    - Hypothesis formulation
    - Testing and research methodology
    - Meaningful (causal relationships amongst facts)
    - Predictive analysis as observed by social facts of **Durkheim**
    - Point gaps for further research
- Fatcs help in
    - Validating or falsifying a theory
    - Base for positivist ideology of sociology
    - Formulate grand mid range thepries
    - Multivariate analysis
    - Comparative analysis
    - Longitudinal
    - Concomitant analysis
- Hence, imperative to understand the coherent dimensions of fact and theory for holistic development of socio as a discipline and defining social relaities
- Example -> women deterioirate condition
- Theory – relation between female workforce and women deteriation
- Hence hypothesis
- However, difficult as no agreement on social facts
- Variations in interpretation of facts
- Hence, while not possible to achieve complete value neutrality, possible to be objective in research and theories
- Socio w/o va;ue is unsociological

## TYPES OF RESEARCH METHODS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Theories make hypothetical claims and data helps in supporting, disproving or modifying them
- _Definitions_
- Methodology
    - Research methodology refers to the theoretical and philosophical framework that guides the entire research process
    - the principles, concepts, approaches used to conduct research, including the overall strategy, and justification for choosing research methods
- Types of data – primary and secondary
    - Primary – data collected by the investigator eg interview
    - Secondary – data already available in some form and collected by others eg official statistics, reports
- Data analysis – organizing data in a systematic way to discover the pattern revealed
- Serendipity – accidently discover sth while other research (like a latent function -> eg Hawthorne effect – find impact of lighting but ended up finding productivity same as they knew they were being observed. unemployment at single and global level, but it manifests into reducing education spending!)
- Quanti and qualti
    - Every theory produces a claim which is either accepted or rejected
    - Eg – suicide rate and industrialization – so need a comparative method to compare suicide rates before and after
    - Overall we used 2 quanti methods 1. Official statistics and 2. Comparative method (statistics means method in socio and not data)

|quantitative research **method**|Quali|
|---|---|
|Positivist **methodology**|Interpretivist|
|Quanti data|Quali data|
|Survey, official stats|In depth interview, observation|
|Used for Generalizations in social world eg – poverty pattern, suicidebsolidarity|Used for find experiences or world view of limited number of individuals or groups in detail ; usually not generalizable|
|Benefit – pulse check (official stats), verifiable , explanatory , unemployment as a root cause of poverty|Eg – **Weber’s** idea of verstehen and ideal types<br><br>Eg – **Ann Oakley** research on Housewives<br><br>Eg **Robert Merton** reference group theory<br><br>Ef **Stouffer’s** soldier deprivation theory<br><br>Eg – **Cicourel** theory of delinquent behavior|
- Epistemological foundation of research method
    - Branch which deals with sources of knowledge - process of knowing the social world
    - 3 ways – direct observational (positivist), indirect experienced (interpretivist), critically examined (critical)
    - Socio knowledge not same as philosophical or personal belief. Since socio claims to be a scientific discipline, it relies on empirical data. Both quantu and quali data in studies are empirical in nature.
    - There are 3 major approaches to know about social world empirically – positivist, inter and critical
- Feminist and Marxist researches
- Types of quanti research method
    - Sociologists use data ie convert social world into a numerical data eg suicide rate, poverty rate, workforce participation raye eyc
    - Structured interview
    - Official statistics – stats published by govt – can be hard facts (cannot be fiddled with) or soft facts (eg crime rate- can be fiddled)
        - Phenomenologist critical as data shows more of their priotities in collection rather than the people surveyed
    - Survey ->
        - Method in which multiple individuals respond to series of questions on a questionnaire or an interview selected from a target population
        - It may take the form of a questionnaire or interview
        - looks at large-scale social patterns abd make comparable resuls
        - It can be quali or quanti
        - Features
            - Runs on Q given to sample of respondents eg – pollsters use survey to gauge public opinion
            - Manufacturers use it to understand product feedback
        - Looks at large scale social patterns
        - Can be open ended or close ended questions
        - Ques may be based on likert gutman or Bogardus scale
    - Questionnaire -> a series of written questions which a researcher presents to respondents
        - Post/ email/ hand
        - Consists of 2 kinds of ques -> Close ended or open ended (veg/non veg or why)
        - Q used by feminist researcher, Marxists, economists, psychologists to understand or collect response on inequality/ gender/ caste race
        - It can be used to find answer to v specific questions
        - Can be used as a component of a large scale social survey in an otherwise spatially dispersed sample as well
        - Used by **Karl Marx** – first time survey in 1880s composed 101 questioned survey titled “**Worker’s enquiry**” amongst more than 25k French workers to understand nature of exploitation
        - Have high reliability as standardized
        - Have high validity as qualitative data can be collected
        - Used by **Goldthorpe** in his affluent worker study
    - Lab experiment – written notes
    - Scale approach -> used to collect quanti data from a set of population (sample)
        - Likert scale – 1,2,3,4,5 eg swiggy; not so reliable
        - Guttman scale – consisting of less likely, most, most unlikely/ agre, strongly agree
        - Bogardus social distance scale - experience of living with minorities in US -> used to measure ipiion of a group about another group (how likely are yoigoing to stay with minority); can have both likerd and gutman
        ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 16.png>)Helps in quantifying qualitative questions + standardization data collection
        - Easier to analyze and draw conslusions
        - Efficiency an reducer error
        - Economical and efficient
    - Structured interview/ formal interview
        - A structured interview is a series of questions a researcher asks respondents in person.
        - Mainl closed questions
        - Asme ques in same order comparable results
        - Respondent can chose only from given options
    - Laboratory experiment/controlled experiment: experiment that takes place in a closed environment where researcher creates laboratory like condition, creates groups like experiment group and controlled group, observe the impact of independent variable on the experiment group (dependent variable).
        - **Bandura’s** bobo doll experiment was conducted to study whether violent television LEADS TO more violence in kids – ans yes; so correlation or causation
- Quali research methods
    - Work with non numerical data for understanding social world and theories like text, notes, videos
    - They describe lived experience in detail
    - Eg – experience of youth going to clg
    - Unstructured interviews
        - Eg **Arlie Hochschild** – 50 couples in a 2 career marriage and 45 otherwise to understanding how shared responsibilities in nwew reality called “the second shift”
    - Ethnography/ participant observation ->
        - PO is a subset of a Ethno -> PO is a technique of data collection whereas ethno is a research method
        - Technique where researcher immerses himself in native’s everyday life and study their culture – PO
            - Eg – **MNS** multi caste tribal groups in Rampura – had diary + language -> identified a caste of people who were dominant caste who were shudras
                - Explained how untouchables were not allowed to sanskritize
            - Limitations – gatekeepers – insiders restrict your worldview to their world view
            - not allow data collection
            - location comfort
            - language learning – diff interpretation leads to reliability and validity
            - ethics of research
            - going native phenomena – you become that person
            - hawthorne effect
            - time consuming
            - no generalization
            - lower validaity
            - partial representation of reality – value relevance
            - problem of role allocation
        - **SC Dube** also – Sharmipet - method of conducting village study
        - PO has field work; E not necessary
        - E:
            - Method which involves deep engagement with community/ village/ tribe/ group in its natural setting eg **MNS** in Sripuram
            - Involves researcher building rapport with research subjects
            - Involves researcher learning local dialect/ lingo/ dialect
            - Maintains a dairy on inhabitants to keep data in a chronological manner
            - It helps in learning the “others” and their world view – develop subaltern perspective, feminist
            - Involves months to years to complete research
            - Eg – **MNS** on Coorg, or Brahmins in Sripuram
    - FGD:
        - Involves a GD on a specific topic by the members from similar background
        - Participants are free to talk with other group members
        - Discussion is observed by researcher
        - Helps find solutions to problems to investigate group attitude and develop in depth understanding
        - Eg – new product and its features by cnsumers
        - Eg – discssion on social issue like climate change
        - From **Robert Merton**
    - Grounded theory
        - developed by two sociologists **Barney Glaser** & **Anselm Strauss**
        - qualitative data based on data collected – create theory
        - based on this, create theory and refine more using further qualitative research
        - eg – how do you cope with stress – many interviews – seek social support – what kind – best way to manage stress is informal support
        - don’t start with a preconceived notion or a theory
    - Comparative approach/ method
        - Compares variables within or across time or space
        - Typologies (**Durkheim**) ->
            - 2 diff social groups within same society eg married single/ religious athiest
            - 2 diff social groups in 2 diff time scales eg **Merton’s** study before and after 40s
            - 2 diff societies in same time scale and across time scale -> **Karl Marx** comparison of diff counties or Europe at start of modern time and later
            - Develop generalization – **Weber** protestant ethics vs religion of India
    - Biography
        - Voice of leaders or voice of mintority in main stream text
        - Study of individual life in depth to gather data and understanding about the person and historical context
        - Bios search as research method because it acts like primary source to collect data on the person in the form of photo, diary, letter, blog etc
        - It can help understand political ideology of leader through speeches and official docs
        - It can help give vice to minority groups
        - It can help to reveal intention and motivation of leaders and how they experienced any specific event
        - Eg – Diary of **Benjamin Franklin** (**Marx Weber** for study of Calvinists) and **Ann Oakley** (housewife study – own study and took their diary also – diary record of how they felt everyday for being responsible for household or childcare)
    - Historical method
        - takes a theme and traces its evolution over time through the study of books, media reports, films, and historical accounts. Such studies require extensive use of secondary data gathered over long periods of time
        - eg – **Weber** and **Marx**, caste evolution
        - data may not be precise/ available/ reliable/ accuracy
- Data analysis significance
    - Marketing and advertising
    - Political campaign
    - Analyze pop priorities eg >36 like gardening whereas 21-25 like clubs
- **Ray Pawson** – debate on this 60s hangover
- **Alan Bryman**
- Triangulation is defined as the mixing of data or methods so that diverse viewpoints or standpoints cast
- light upon a topic. The mixing of data types, known as data triangulation, is often thought to help in
- validating the claims that might arise from an initial pilot study.
- It is a valuable strategy in social sciences to enhance the credibility, reliability, and comprehensiveness of
- research findings as given below:
    - • Gain a more complete understanding: Employing a variety of research methods (qualitative,
    quantitative, and others) provides researchers with different perspectives on the same social
    phenomenon. For example, **Lenin** used a mixture of quantitative data tables along with a political economy
    analysis of charged words used in his classic research monograph, **The Development of Capitalism**
    **in Russia** (1898).
    - • Minimize Bias: Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Triangulation allows researchers
    to leverage the strengths of different methodologies and mitigate the potential biases inherent in any
    single approach.
    o For instance, in “**Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste**,” **Pierre Bourdieu**
    integrated qualitative methods with quantitative analysis to mitigate biases inherent in singular
    methods.
    - • Increased confidence in findings: Replication of results across different methods strengthens the
    reliability of findings. If various approaches consistently yield similar conclusions, it increases
    confidence that the findings are not simply an artefact of the chosen method.
    - • Richer and more nuanced understanding: Triangulation allows researchers to capture a more
    complete picture of the social phenomenon under study.

## SAMPLING
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- It is a process of collecting sample from pop for a desired research
- Random or non random sampling ->
    - Random sample
        - Simple random – a process where everyone has equal chance of getting selected as a part of sample,. Done through random number generator eg – chits in a class
        - Stratified random – process of dividing the group into strata seg gender/ age based and then conducting random sampling within each strata
        - Systematic random – select every nth element as starting point and other members are selected after a fixed sampling interval
    - Non random
        - Convenience: those who are conveniently available to researcher are taken eg – first 30 customers of store
        - Voluntary response: a sample based on the ease of respondents. R directly contact the researchers and volunteer themselves
        - Purposive: Involves researcher using his/ her judgement to select a sample which is most useful to the purpose of research. Researcher wants to gain detailed knowledge about the specific group and may exclude other groups.
        - Snowball: It is used in cases which involves inaccessible or elite strata of society. Researcher gets in touch with a group and that group introduces researcher to another group

## RESEARCH DESIGN
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Refers to a set of/ document which lays down research question, objectives, sampling method and type of research method used for data collection
- Types
    - Exploratory: involves research to understand an unexplored phenomena eg – reason for certain dropout in school , why is suicide increasing
    - Explanatory : after understanding cause, researcher expalains cause in detail. Focus is on explaining a phenomena to cause effect relationship. Comes after exploratory research and aims to go deeper into result produced during exploratory research eg – what is impact (quali)
    - Descriptive: type of research which provides description of the characteristics of a phenomena eg – how many impacted – more quanti
- Utility
    - Limit scope
    - Conduct research comprehensively in a specific direction
    - Address dd of question
    - Decide research method
    - Imparts scientific status to research
    - Cross sectional research design – findings across time and space
    - Longitudinal research design
    - All based on question being studied
    - Value neutrality and objectivity
- No research without design

## HYPOTHESIS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **GA Lundberg** - Tentative generalization whose validity yet remains to be tested
- usually links two or more social variables
- 2 – simple hypothesis, more than 2 – complex hypothesis
- eg
- acts as starting point for research eg – poverty as a factor behind crime rate
- helps in data collection,
- direction – quali or quanti (data method and research design)
- limit scope
- proving or disproving a claim
- making theory, generalization or law
- reliability and validity
- Sources
    - existing literature
    - personal experience
    - deductive theory uses hypothesis – positivists
- Variables
    - any data which is subject to change is a variable
    - can be dependent or independent variable (effect and cause respectively)
    - can be quanti (data on income, age poverty) or quali variable (data on experience)
    - operationalization of variable -> process of quantifying a seemingly immeasurable phenomena eg – health of democract based on free speech, free fair electins, representation of people -> HDI index

## PYQ
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Rupture of modernity -> collapse of functionalism and bankruptcy of Marxism
    - Functionalism fall – give the three postulates of **Merton**
    - Marxism fall – give china + **Popper** + need to focus on individual meanings
    - Rupture of modernity – fundamentalism, religious revivalism, individualism
- **HERMENEUTICS**- TEXTS
- WHO ALL IN INFORMAL – CASTE, FEMINIST, SUBALTERN, CONFLICT, CHILD, TRIBE

## KARL MARX
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- _Marx is an institution, not a person_
- **St Simon** – ethical socialism
- **Historical Materialism**: theory given by **Marx** how history evolves in dialectical manner through change in material condition
    - Book: **Preface to Contribution to Critique of Political Economy**
    - What: Evolution of society (modes of production) with changes in material factors or economic infrastructure (consisting of forces of production and relations of production – relation b/w man and man and man and things)
    - Supplemented by **dialectic materialism** where two opposing forces interact with each other and create new structures
        - Dialectics is a way of analysing society through study of inherent contradictions and negations
        - MOP – how soc s org for goods and services
    - Inspired by **Hegel’s** idea of Dialectical idealism (that society changes with new ideas – human mind is mother of everything) – I think therefore I exist
        - **Hegel** in his idealism focused on **dialectic approach** of **thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis** for change in society – ideas emerge, counter emerges and new ideas form
        - **Hegel** said society is evolving and has 3 stages – universal reflexivity (everyone has same ideas – same as mechanical solidarity of **Durkheim**); universal egoism (everyone is focused on self interest) and universal altruism (state exists)
        - **Phenomenology of mind** – book
        - Consciousness lies in ideas

|   |   |

- But found this abstract, so took **Feuerbach’s** idea of materialism (society doesn’t change only with ideas)
    - Even considered **Engel’s** 3 laws of unity/ conflict of opposition, transition from quant to qual, negation of negation
    - Two opposing forces when interact with each other lead to conflict and create a new social structure
    - Talk about the MOP and “contradiction of history will end”
- Salient features
    1. Ideas are creation of ruling class
    2. Economy is the case
    3. Human is a working being
- _Relations of production_
    - **History is a process of man’s self creation**
    - **In order to survive, man must produce**
    - **Production is the first historical act**
    - **Man is perpetually a dissatisfied animal**
    - Humans have basic needs (roti kapda makaan) but they are not readily available. So individuals enter into social relations of production
    - These relations help transform RM into finished goods using means of production (forces of production) eg – energy, tool tech etc
    - Means of production are owned by a class of people
    - Eventually, ownership justified with help of social structure created by ruling class (like religion)
    - Due to inherent contradiction in economic system, class struggle develops. Old collapses and new comes in
    - Class struggle is the motor of history
    - Relation bw have (who own means of production) and have nots (who don’t own means of production)
    - Forces of production keep changing with change in tech – instruments without which prod is not possible – consists of scientific knowledge, technological equipment and organization of collective labor
    - Source of surplus lays in the excess of what bourgeoise / capitalist pay for labor power (ie the capacity to do value things which increases the value of the product) over the value labor power adds to a commodity
    - These can be ownership (ownership remains with the bourgeoisie) or control relations (controls production process and labour)
    - These man to man relations lead to **stratification based on their position in the production process**
    - Relation is usually in the form of **antagonistic cooperation** for man-to-man
    - Have nots don’t have ownership over things required in production process other than their own labour (not even that in ancient slave society)
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 20.png>)
- Relevance today
    - Relevance is visible when we see:
    - Demand for universal basic income
    - Neolocal and migration
    - Labor code demands
    - Peasant movement
    - Rising inequality
    - Rising monopoly
    - Rising alienation – resignation
    - Demand for social security laws not in favor of capitalist
    - Demand for regularisizng work of gig workers
    - Women – regularize working condition (pending – women reservation bill in private sector)
    - Global inequality and dependency theory
    - Commodity fetishism
- Not relevant
    - Rising middle class – look up to bourgeoise
    - Creative and customized professions + not homogenous working class
    - Labor union – overthrow becomes difficult
    - NOT ALL MASS PROD – EG ROLEX
- _Modes of production – refers to way society is organized to create goods and services_
    - Consists of means and relations of production (leads to have and have nots)
        - Tools used to create goods and services
    - Relation between class who are producing goods and services
    - Each MOP collapses due to inherent contradiction/ dialectics and from the other develops the new MOP
        - **Primitive communism**: collective ownership, production, distribution. over time, new needs develop leading to a new MOP due to inherent contradiction
            - all men were equal with equal access to forces of production in a “hunter gatherer society”. Food was abundant with ltd pop leading to cooperation rather than domination. But with invention of tools, society started breaking up as some men had more food than others, leading to private ownership with a few people and dependent slaves and hence a new mode of production emerged. negation of primitive communism
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 21.png>)
        - **Ancient slave mode of production**: ownership – master, production by slave, distribution – unequal; secondary needs develop over time -> new MOP; now exploitation by masters sch as slave trade and plantation economy leads to **inherent contradictions** and ends in slave revolt
        - **Feudal mode of production**: inherent contradictions: internal (**reducing productivity, tax revenue systems**) and external (**emergence of mercantilism, enclosure movement** as well as people finding working opp in city life with rise of capitalists)
        - **Capitalism**: inherent contradiction –
            1. **profit motive** leads to **overproduction of goods**
            2. goods for profit and not to serve human needs (**commodity fetishism**)
            3. wage cuts/ machines -> will create a **reserve army** of people
            4. reduced purchasing power and over production -> **recession**
            5. with recession, small and medium enterprises may lose market share and may be bought outby big players -> **monopolization**
            6. now lower middle class will join **proletariat class (proletarianization**) and upper middle class will in bourgeoise (**monopolization**)
            7. homogenization of Working class with more technological innovation
            8. pauperization increases + depression of middle class (movement)
            9. capitalism will be overthrown
        - **Exchange value more than use value -> commodities are created**
        - Difference between subsistence wages paid to labour and overall production is surplus which goes to capitalist. Such private ownership of surplus will lead to class struggle by workers, who will start feeling alienated and will demand ownership of surplus (Negation of negation)
        - **Features – money as a medium of exchange, ownership of capital with the bourgeoise, production process controlled by the capitalist, financial decision by the capitalist, commodity fetishism – goods for sale rather than own consumption**
        - **Socialism**: Proletariat will assume ownership of the means of production and production process in response to the class conflict of capitalism. There will be no private property – “disctatorship of class”.
        - **And surplus will be discutributed Communism**: “**Contradiction of history will end**” – Proletariat will renounce ownership of production process and truly end class conflict, where everyone will be equal. No new unequal relations of production, which ends dialectical materialism. Forces of production are collectively owned
        - **In conclusion, MOP develops in response to seeds of dialectics in previous MOP**
        - **Critical**
            - Dialectics between sexes ignored eg women suffrage movement
            - Dialectics of caste ignored eg **Ambedkar**
            - Class collaboration – trade union, cooperatives, labor codes, ESOPs
- Reserve army
    - Consists of unemployed, partially employed or under employed individuals
    - Expands with conditions of recession
    - Typology
        - Floating: workers regularly displaced due to cyclical fluctuations, bankruptcy, failure of firms and tech innovations
        - Stagnant: workers whose employment is seasonal or irregular
        - Latent: workers displaced from agri due to capitalist dev -> Changes in ASS show MOP evolution as per **AR Desai**
        - Pauper: who leave reserve army and form dangerous classes of criminals, sex workers, beggars
    - Helps capitalist class as employed will not bargain, keep wages low (eg – unorganized sector) + ensure workers are readily available and don’t demand better working conditions or form a union
    - In india, IRA is found consisting of tribals, minroties, women and others like these (**Suresh Mehrotpa**)
    - Feminist theory – **Beechey**: women constitute the biggest chunk in IRA(lindor employed, under, part time employed) – glass ceiling, wall, cliff, global gender inequality report
    - Can give suggestions
    - **Claudia Goldin** – entering service sector workforce
    - **Irene Bougel** – women rep in IRA declined with expansion of service sector
    - **D Dsouza** – migration for finding work
- **Centrality to one major thing** in every mode of production
- Class polarization
    - There will be polarizarion and homogenization amongst classes, leading to a class conflict
    - Facilitated by pauperization (inequality), proletarization (petty bourgeoise will sink into proletariat and concentration and centralization will lead to rise in capital being concentrated in fewer hands
- Being vs social being
    - Being: The constant part of human nature, which is creative and tends to make things to express the creativity
    - Social being: **Human nature** is governed by his social position in the mode of production. Excessive limitation on creativity leads to alienation
    - **Man’s consciousness doesn’t decide his being, contrary, social relation determine his consciousness**
- Alienation (**economic and political manuscripts**)
    - In capitalist MOP, alienation reaches its peak as **labour is only a means to end, which is production for capitalist**. He becomes a slave in production and creativity is lost
    - Hence, he starts getting **separated, isolated and powerless and meaningless** when he confronts social institutions that they cant control and consider oppressive
    - He gets a feeling a **estrangement and disenchantment** from a group, others even oneself
    - Alienation happens in two ways: in a given MOP, it increases with time as exploitation increases + degree increases as MOP increases
    - 4 types of alienation
- Alienation of proletariat
    - Process: Process is fixed irrespective of his own individuality and he doesn’t have any control over production process. Work becomes a means to end. The extreme DOL coerces him to become a part of the work and mechanical work does not satisfy him
    - Product: cant determine the fate of what he produces. Market works to promote the interest of the capitalist and not the worker. doesn’t have control over quality or quantity of product
    - Peers: isolated and compartmentalized work with no time to interact with others. Also competes for scarce jobs
    - Self: he loses control over his own thoughts also and works out of compulsion and not choice
- End is de-alienation which will involve capitalism where forces are collectively owned + condition of work is humanized
- **It is possible for me to do one thing to do and another tomorrow**
- **It was a history of man’s increasing control over nature, at the same time it was history of increasing alienation of man**
- **Explains rising alienation and silent quitting**
- **Even alienation amongst bourgeoise as they produce what the market wants and not what they want**
- **Supported by**
    - **Weber** – iron cage theory with extreme bureaucratization
    - **CW Mills** (**White collar**): even white collared people suffer alienation. Non manual workers have to sell their skills and hence, their personalities are bought and sold like any other commodity, alienating them from their being
    - **Herbert Marcuse**: **One Dimensional man** – leisure lies in false needs created by media to picture a “happy robot” compulsively chase “false needs”
- Class and class struggle (**Communist Manifesto**)
    - **Das Kapital** – class is people with same position in production process
    - Distinguished between 2 types->
    - Class in itself: A group of people working to fulfil their economic needs; class which doesn’t have consciousness of their position and conflict. This happens because they see similar features they have others but they themselves don’t realize they are a part of the stratum – objective manifestation of class
    - Class for itself (can be true or false consciousness). A group of people who identify capitalists as opposite to them; or as an exploitative class The reality of members and their consciousness converges (stratification lines become clear). – contradiction between class consciousness and reality of situation ends
        - **Goal is emancipation of all**
        - **Change the system – end of perpetual class struggle**
        - **Have class consciousness and class solidarity**
    - Conflict starts with consciousness and increases with antagonistic cooperation
    - Factors that lead to class struggle:
        - Bust and tech innovation
        - Proletarianization
        - Industrial reserve army
        - Depression
        - Monopolization
        - leadership, common enemy, critical mass of true consciousness, Class polarization/ pauperization – the gap between bourgeoise and proletariat will increase and this will lead to the them becoming poorer in relation to the bourgeoise – increasing class consciousness, network of communication, exploitation, alienation (conflict will be highlighted by the contradiction between social production and individual ownership)
        - ALSO Homogenization of workers will lead to disappearing of differences between skiled, semi skilled and unskilled workers
        - Resource alienation
    - What prevents class for itself? Super structural ideas, media **AR Desai**
        - Institutions and ideology justify eg religion opium + theodicy of disprivelege
        - Embourgoisement and perceive bourgeoise as a reference group rather than as exploitative opposition class with inherent contradiction
    - **History repeats itself first as tragedy and then as farce (emerging class falls back into an exploitative social structure) – polarization diagram**
    - **History of existing societies is history of class struggle**
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 22.png>)
    - Revolution will not come on its own but only if mature conditions exist
    - He talked about intermediate classes also – 6 classes in class struggle in France and 8 classes in revolution and counter revolution Germany
    - **Michael Mann** – development of class consciousness in 4 phases – class identity, class opposition, class totality and emergence of alternate society
- Commodity fetishism
    - Fetish - When commodities assume super natural qualities external to the makers
    - In capitalism, commodities are endowed with qualities like status, beauty, success, identity, lifestyle
    - **Marx** believes it’s the work of the people which gives value to these commodities but in capitalism, too much focus on commodities, not on workers
    - Craftsmanship and recognition overshadowed by brand / capital
    - Dead labor (finished good) more imp than living labor
    - Jewellery, electronics (eg – apple: update to latest iphone not for features but they want to show off), automobiles (Thar) fashion and textile (eg – Zara and H&M), luxury watches (Rolex)
    - Things become more imp than man who produces them
    - Now man and product produced have diff existences
    - In capitalism, man is not entitled to the fruit of his labor; instead it has an exchange value
    - Even labor gets an exchange value which is bought and sold
    - Little power of what we produce and hence alienation
- Other imp concepts
    - Industrial reserve army – which provides lbor in excess prosperity an cheap labor in otherwise
- Women
    - **William Goode** – industrialization made women to work
    - **Marx** – women still face old torments along with economic exploitation of capitalism
    - Feminist – problems of women submerged in family
    - **Kath Ennis** – in theory, capitalism can do without family but in practice, it require such fundamental change that it is hard to imagine it ever being carried out
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 23.png>)
- Emerging knowledge based capitalism – science and patents instead of only machines – surveillance capitaltalism of **Zuboff**
- World is going towards capitalism incl china which claims to be a socialist country
- What **Marx** looked at, the 19th century Europe, is v diff from current world
- Now, capitalist interest is distributed amongst shareholders
- Moving towards a manager managed capitalism – manager is not a capitalist but a labour
- Shift from monopolistic capitalism to cooperative capitalsm
- **Raymond Aron** – industrial society can be capitalist or socialist; but industry continues to be in the centre – both are focused on prod, just that in one, state is not as controlling + in socialism, one super industrialist vs in capitalism, multiple industrialists
    - Also said in socialism, state takes a percentage of your money – so still being exploited
- Acts as heuristic theory
- Shift from colonialization to sovereignty – class struggle
- Naxalism, Russia Ukraine
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 24.png>)
- Alienation
- Division of labor
    - **Karl Marx** suggests two types of DOL – social DOL and industrial/ manufacturing DOL
        - Social DOL includes members undertaking certain activities based on skills/ tools and exchanging it with others for the commodity to maintain socio economic life
        - Manufacture alienates/ isolates the producer from the product -> profits accre to capitalist, explitation and alienation increases
        - Leads to dehumanization of humans (vs integration by D)
        - Not based on occupational specialization
        - DOL inevitable and evolves with societal evolution
        - Anomic DOL vs alienations
    - Different from **Durkheim**

### CRITICISM
- Historical materialism and MOP
    - **Popper**: reductionist theory as he reduced importance of all other factors in society to mere economic infrastructure and material factors ; over emphasized conflict and ignored social factors
    - **Simmel**: conflict has its own functions
    - **Dahrendorf**: (**class and class conflict in industrial society**)
        - More than eco, what is imp is political class
        - Differential authority is root cause of conflict, not economic infrastructure
        - There is not as much rife with antagonism as **Marx** has visualized
        - Inequalities are highly dynamic
    - Non-positivist: ignored micro aspect
    - **Louis Althussar** – state controls over citizen by kiss or kick and not the capitalist. State influences the ideology of houses
    - **Gramsci** – domination whether in capitalism or socialism is not class domination but hegemonistic domination (ie the collective domination of a few who get power and then break promises – use ideology to dominate)
    - **Frank Parkin** – “**class inequality and political order**” – classes exist even in socialist countries
- MOP
    - Not materialized even after 140 years of theory
    - Narrow empiricism
    - Capitalism seems to be getting stronger
    - Too utopian
    - No feminism angle as patriarchy was an important angle of capitalism growth
    - Communist countries failed politically
    - Workers have themselves become stronger and organized
    - **Weber** – sole focus on economic determinism inadequate
    - **Anthony Giddens** – criticizes for neglecting individual action in social change
    - Other basis of stratification
    - **Lenski**: other MOP may emerge after breakdown of capitalism
    - **Dahrendorf**: heterogeneous workers who are difficult to be united; revolution is an impossibility as middle class will emerge and we move towards a modern society
    - **Weber**: classes are not communities who will unite; revolution is a distant possibility
    - **Ken Roberts**: limited evidence of a social class developing in manual workers (**Class in contemporary Britain**)
    - **Raymond Williams** – cultural history ad ideologies/ discourses define and shape historical development
    - **Bourdieu** – capital
    - **S Firestone**: no focus on dialectics of women, dialectics of caste (**Ambedkar**)
- Alienation
    - Very generic which club all occupations, which may not be necessarily true eg cricket
    - **Popper**: breeding ground for innovation
    - **Durkheim**: anomie and alienation can be corrected by correcting existing structure and doesn’t need an overhaul
    - **Goldthorpe** and **Lockwood**: a means to end which is std of living and not prod for capitalist (affluent worker)
    - **Robert Blauner**: alienation depends on the diff technologies and work the worker does (**Alienation and freedom**) – they go on a recreational tour to end alienation
    - **Bertell Ollman** – v difficult to distinguish between alienation and job dissatisfaction
    - **Braverman** and **John Scott** – Managerial evolution where managers are involved between bourgeoise and proletariat
    - Contemporary y jobs such as gig economy/ wfh
- Positive influence over **Gramsci**, **Adorno**, **Habermus**
- Economic determinist (too much focus on economics), but fail to see he also said superstructure helps in functioning of eco
- Can explain India’s naxalism + world system theory of **Wallerstein**

## WEBER (FATHER OF MODERN SOCIO)
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Sociology is a science which attempts at **interpretive understanding of social actions** to arrive at explanation of cause and effect
- Bridged gap between positivism (use of scientific methods) and idealism (**Kant**)
- Social action
    - First developed in “**Economy and society**”
    - An action with a meaning attached by actor, oriented towards others and taking into account the behavior of others
        - Meaning attached: actor is conscious of his actions and has some motivation to take it. Values don’t have an independent impact on the actor but are interpreted by the actor to undertake action
        - Oriented towards others, which may be physically or mentally present.
    - Understand cause and effect – basis of sociology
    - 4 types of **Ideal types of social action**
        - Rationality -> orientation to reality which weighs means and ends for purpose of efficacy
        - Affective – meaning is generated due to emotional response dedicated by the mind of the actor
        - Traditional – meaning due to cultural beliefs and traditions -> reacts automatically to habitual stimuli which guides in course of repetition or belief
        - Zweck rational – action with logical means to achieve logical end -> by well calculated logic and plan
        - Wert rational – value oriented rational actions - driven by value of society
        - eg – why actor (SRK/ Kapoor family/ bring social change/ earn a lot)
        - No action is a pure action. In reality, every action is muddled. So ideal type can help understand theoretical pure types not found in reality
- **Weber** rejected methods of natural science and developed his own methods in “**Methodologies for Social Science**”
- Verstehen (to interpret) – translate to human understanding (**MOSS**)
    - First by **Dilthey** but interpretivism by **Weber** and **Simmel**
    - Foundation of most of **Weber’s** work and one of his key contributions
    - Human understanding which involves comprehending at the level of actor by following systematic simple steps
    - Investigator should reconstruct the actor’s situational choices and constraints
    - He should be at the same wavelength with the actor
    - He should have no sympathy to actor or situation; maintain objectivity in his investigation
    - He should interact with actor to get primary sources of data
    - This can maximise the probability to understand true meaning behind an social actions
    - Meaning can be drawn via two observations (Eco and soc): direct observation (where meaning is clearly visible and understand by physical characteristics of the act and the external world eg shouting) or explanatory observation (investigator draws meaning by explaining the situation and constraint – puts the act in a context and assigns a motive to it) eg – wood to sell or fire
    - Based on the idea that meaning precedes social act. **Weber** study of “**meaningful conduct**”
- Causal Pluralist method – rejected the mono-causal theory for social actions, and said there are multiple causes leading to a social action. Focus should be on identifying the probable causes (Probabilistic theory) to understand meaning of social actions.
- Ideal types: 2nd most important contribution by **Weber**, which involves developing abstractions to understand complexity of social world by focusing on certain traits of an item
    - one sided **mental category** which highlights features deemed essential by researcher
    - **It is not a description of reality in itself but a way to express reality – it is not a pure type**
    - **Lachman**: Act as measuring rod to understand actual phenomenon. These are heuristic devices
    - **Weber** agrees there are regularities in societies, but these regularities are in the mind of the actor. The actor has subjective interpretation of these regularities
    - Used for comparison, building hypothesis and **limited generalization**
    - Ideal type tries to understand meanings in term of **regularities** and differences
    - Helps in giving objectivity to research
    - **Ideal types are formed by a number of elements, which may or may not be directly observable and hence are identified by subjective understanding of the investigator**
        - They are neither description nor hypothesis of reality but can help in description or explanation
        - Often used to general phenomena that occur at diff times and places
        - Aim – look at society objectively without bias – nth to do with values
    - Ideal types can be used in 3 categories: Historical particular, Abstract phenomena (such as social action or authority), particular behaviour (such as economic/ pol behaviour of supply demand )
    - benefits
        - Gives a ready framework for investigators to understand meanings
        - saves time
        - helps in forecasting
        - establish linkages amongst distinct social phenomenas (such as Protestant ethics and capitalism)
    - Used in **Economic and social organization, city and sociology of religion**
    - **Susan Jones** – helped socio become a separate discipline
    - Criticism -> difficult to understand the true meaning without context + bias of investigator
        - Ignored latent meaning
    - Examples of ideal type today
        - Capitalism – std, free market, profit motive – but in reality, sate intervention
        - Democracy – equality, representation, no unfair practices (diff types across world)
        - Family – middle class happy family (cereal family) – actual neolocal , diff features in diff families
- Authority – essay 1922
    - Power is an aspect of social relationships
    - Power is chane to influence others even against their will/ resistance and regardless of the basis on which opportunity rests
    - He elaborate his study in context of power in history of society what called “**Herschaf** – authority”
    - **Chance or probability** of command being obeyed by **group of people** is authority
    - Power has an element of coercion also, where authority is a form of legitimate power
    - Elements of authority
        - Master/ ruler or a group of masters/ rulers
        - Ind/ group that is ruled
        - Will of ruler is expressed through commands
        - Evidence of influence of rulers in compliance
        - Direct/ indirect evidence that rulers commands need to be obeyed
    - Patterns of authority have changed over time. 3 types of authority –
        - Traditional: authority **obeyed due to belief in traditions**, customs and values.
            - To make traditional authority more palatable, he made 3 ideal types within the ideal type
            - Gerontocracy – rule of elderly eg gram panchayat (no staff)
            - Patriarchalism eg fater, father in law, maternal uncle (no staff)
            - Patrimonialism : elderly men with proper staff for administration (eg -Parliament)
        - Charismatic:
            - Authority obeyed due to belief in charisma of a person
            - Eg – religious, political, business (eg – steve jobs), edu (Divyakranti)
            - Defines as a certain quality of an individual by virtue of which he is considered **extraordinary** and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman or atleast specifically **exceptional** powers or qualities
            - from personal traits of the leader. The person ceases to be leader if followers doesn’t find him charismatic. This can lead to revolution and is more prominent during a crisis. Hence, its usually short lived during the time of crisis - “devotion to exceptional sanctity, heroism, or exemplary character of an individual person and of order revealed or ordained by him
        - Legal rational: authority obeyed due to belief in legal rules and legislation.
    - Component used
        - Ideal type
        - Social action (affective is charismatic)
        - Power and authority
        - Causal pluralism – eg social action are not unique – necessary and sufficient causes
        - Elective affinity : connection drawn between 2 ideal types eg-> traditional SA and traditional authority; protestant ethics and capitalism
    - eg – college (dean), school (princi), office (director), sports club (coach)
    - in reality, no authority is pure type. They are all approximate types
    - people may obey authority due to multiple reasons. However, task of interpretive socio is to understand the change in patterns of command - obedience
- Rationalization
    - Change in the way people are thinking from traditional to rational ways
    - This historical evolution visible in changing form of social action and changing form of authority
    - So social action goes from affective to traditional to wert rational to zweck ration
    - Authority from traditional to charismatic to legal rational authority
    - Processes/ events which shaped -> scientific revolution, enlightenment, French revolution (common people) -> no of votes
    - Industrial revolution -> standardization and meritocracy – everything is well established and standardized
    - Example: number of marks is the focus, short notes for efficiency, well standardized criteria (1-12, then Ug), std currciculum
    - Example – food industry: more food items at less cost, food in min time(efficiency in cons), standardized protocol
    - Example – media – 1 min 100 news, Inshorts – cons of news efficiently, standard template for news
    - one authority may change into another such as routinization of charisma or traditionalization of rationality
    - Features of revolution
        - Efficiency
        - Calculability
        - Standardization – well patterned
        - Human will be considered as cases
- Bureaucracy
    - Analyzed through his approach of ideal type
    - Secondary group which is organized to complete tasks efficiently (sec means impersonal)
    - **Weber** def of bureaucracy – “hierarchical org designed to coordinate work of many individuals in the pursuit of large scale administrative tasks and org goals most commonly used in modern society
    - bureaucracy is the most rational form of legal rational authority (**Water**)
        - Hierarchical in nature
        - Impersonal
        - Rules based
        - No scope for improvisation
        - Position Cannot be appropriated
        - Staff is trained according to the requirement
        - Efficiency of highest degree
        - Different from bureaucrats, who are just positions in the bureaucracy social structure
        - Each admin official Specialized DOL and responsibility in their area of expertise
        - recruitment on merit
        - benefit of predictability and efficiency
    - found in both public and private sector for efficient completion of tasks
    - Modernization creates **hedonists without hearts and specialists without spirits**
    - While it is an appropriation of reality (ideal typical representation not completely capture the living reality) , modern societies are moving towards this type of bureaucracy
    - However, it may lead to “iron cage of rationality”, where rationality becomes so dominant that individual creativity of the person is restricted, leading to alientation
        - Can lead to dictatorship
        - It is rule bound and no space for human values
        - Cannot supersede chain of command and personally doesn’t have any power
        - Will lead to dehumanization and rationalization
    - Counter: may industries which run on creative ideas and don’t have strict rules (**Blau** study – also marketing industry, coding, music, ABP by NITI ayog, role of thics in governance, mission karamyogi)
    - **Robert Michels** (**Political parties**) – iron law of oligarchy -> will aim to preserve their power and org becomes a goal in itself. So become conservative
        - Demo seems inconceivable w/o organization but in reality, org is the death knell of democracy
    - Other concerns – disenchantment, dictatorship of officials, red tapism (ritualism)
        - Power gets concentrated in hands of a few minority to get task competed
    - **George Ritzer** – mcdonaldization to explain increasing mechanization
    - Criticism
        - **Blau** – rules don’t maximise efficiency. Instead informal settings exist within formal bureaucracy that can max efficiency due to red tapism
        - **Goldner** – bureaucratization depdenent on type of work.. predictable job -> bureaucratic org; unpredictable -> absence of hierarchy
        - **Henry Mintzberg**
            - Diff types of bureaucracy – simple (in shopkeeper), machine, divisional (global level – regions eg MCd), professional (schools, clg, music club), adhrocracy (temp form like movie – also **Avin Toffler**)
        - **Burns** and **Stalker** – said also organic bureaucracy which is bottom up not top down
        - Has inefficiency and red tapism
- Rationalization of bureaucracy
    - Bureaucracy evolved due to European climate
    - Define intellectual forces in Europe and impact like rationality and effieicny
    - As a result bureaucracy evolved over time

    - Shift from patrimonial to industrial bureaucracy shows historical experience of Europe
    - Monarchs had patriarchal bureaucracy whereas they have legal rational now
    - B is now concerned with max goods in min time
- Protestant ethics and capitalism
    - Not directly challenge marxist belief that eco infra to social superstructure. Instead believed ideas become an effective force in history and can also shape eco regime
    - 19th century Europe saw a rise of capitalism and protestant ethics around the same time; “Is there a correlation between the two”
    - state of mind concerning making ways of making wealth . this state has been historically present across societies across ancient times
        - defined 4 types of capitalism -> rationalism of capitalism
            - booty cap - war
            - traditional – silk route merchants
            - pariah - Jews
            - rational – logical calculated means of making wealth
    - Created ideal types of both (**OPAN**) and (**WIPE**) -> led to elective affinity
        - **OPAN**:
            - O – created the world for his own glory
            - There exists an absolute transcedant god who created the world
            - Predestination - Predestined each to salvation or damnation -> led to anxiety
            - Asceticism – don’t consume money – deny worldly pleasure
            - Notion of calling – all work is sacred and should be done with devotion
        - **WIPE** – capitalism
            - Capital – as reinvested
            - Efficient worker
            - Wealth accumulation is the ultimate motive of capitalism
            - Individualism is more imp for hardwork and dedication
            - Profit accumulation by rational org of work
            - Ethics of work with time is money and work is worship
    - Realized that the uncertainty of salvation made people believe success/ wealth is source of being chosen by God in afterlife. So they started working hard (leading to rise of capitalism)
    - Parallel rise of charismatic leaders also helped in development
    - Dual variables exist for rise of capitalism – spirit and substance
    - Helped by substance – tech and skills
    - Elective affinity of protestants that it led to rise of capitalism
    - “**Religion of China**” – Confucius ethics believed in collectivism/ harmony and not individualism, which is not in line with spirit of capitalism
    - Religion of india - Similarly for Hindus, caste barriers in form of Karma and that worldly activity is not important for afterlife – no spirirt
    - Ancient Judaism – no substance
    - Observing dedication towards work makes God happy
    - **Gunnar Myrdal** – similar lines – Indian archaic inst that hindered growth of economic society
    - Diff from Marxist capitalism
        - Not based on exploitation but religious beliefs and uncertainty of salvation
        - Not alienation but motivation
        - Modern cap applies rational means to profit for a rational end

### CRITICISM
- **CW Mills**: Spent limited focus on mental processes
- **Merton**: no focus on latent functions ( No focus on unintended consequences)
- No focus of societal factors
- No focus on collective action
- High level of subjectivity possible with investigator as no standard framework for formulating ideal types
- Ideal types
    - Focus on extremes
    - High subjectivity of investigator on what traits
    - No proper methodology to develop ideal types
    - Difficult to understand the relation between phenomena
- Protestant
    - **Kautsky** – capitalism preceded and protestants and developed only to justify their position
    - Took certain elements of religion and ignored others
    - Asceticism in other periods also – then why 19 century only
    - Why catholic Christians didn’t rise?
    - **Tawney** – overlooked influence of other factors like political/ legal/ institutional factors
    - **Immanuel Wallerstein** – Eurocentric
    - **Milton Singer** – took selective elements in Chettiars of Madras which had both spirirt and substance
    - **Stone**: Not protestants but bureucrats that led to capitalism
    - **Veena Das** – took too myopic a view of Indian society

## TALCOTT PARSONS
**VALUE CONSENSUS IN SOC MAINTAINED BY AGIL FRAMEWORK AND A PRE-REQUISITE FOR SURVIVAL OF SOCIETY**
**Neo structural functionalist**
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Parsons** analyzed and criticized the existing schools of thought as follows
    - Utilitarians – studied the social world in a highly individualistic fashion ; however they focus on individual choice and miss the collective
    - Positivists believed that laws of society can be observed as natural scines using empiricism and generalization ; they overlook the role of values and norms
    - Idealists – believed ideas/ consciousness is the basis of all social reality; they focus on values but miss out of external pressures of society
- Father of structural functionalism, esp in America with his grand functional theories, while considering micro aspect of social action
- He saw society as a social system comprising of sub systems with actors having unique functional pre-requisites
- Society evolves from easy to complex forms
- He rejected **Hobbes** view that man functions out of fear – instead he believed value consensus is the integrating force of society and motivates man to undertake roles
- Motive of socio is to understand how this value consensus is reached
- Social action (**Structure of social action**)
    - An act done consciously is social action. 4 elements
        - Act in a social situation
        - Orientation towards attainment of a goal
        - Regulated by norms and values
        - Investment of energy
    - The orientation may be motivational (**cognitive** – see envt in relation to their need, **cathectic** – based on emotional attitude of the actor towards object, **evaluative** – evaluate the optimum efficiency) taking into account needs and plans or value orientation (**appreciative** – judge emotional response, **cognition** – judge validity of judgement, **moral** – what is the right thing to do)
        - Motivational arise due to personal condition of actor
        - Value orientation rises due to value and norms of society
    - Three types of social action:
        - Instrumental (similar to Zweck rational social Action) – where evaluative motivation is dominating
        - Expressive – appreciative value component
        - Moral – value orientation is dominant – you are working according to societal norms
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 30.png>)
    - Ideal type of classification of social action, modes of orientation and social system is pattern variable
    - **Parsons** categorically classified human actions and society to expressive orientation and instrumental orientation
    - Expressive orientation had emotional expression, personal relationships vs instrumental orientation involves prioritize individualism, achievement of goals and rules and fulfilment of responsibilities
    - 6 types of dichotomies possible **ADAPCO**
        - Affective vs affective neutrality – A is quality of expressing one’s emotions eg – at home or romantic relationship, need affectivity whereas no expressive emotion in workplace
        - Diffuseness vs specificity – D is a quality of multiple roles played by a single individual vs well defined roles by specialized individuals eg mother plays a diffused role whereas a teacher when only be a teacher in school
        - Ascription vs achievement
        - Particularism vs universality – P is giving preferential treatment to individuals on basis of expressive ties. Vs U is equal treatment to everyone irrespective of personal ties-> special privilege to a friend (individual as unique vs same – impartial and fair)
        - Collectivity vs self orientation : see himself as apart of bigger whole vs independent
        - Eg – In India no tradition to modernization but modernization of tradition eg – caste based political party, secularism of India
        - It is the affinity between mode or orientation and subsystem that define social order of society
        - Helps in
            - Understanding modern institutions eg education schools with achievement based and universal
            - Understand conflict between traditional and modern orientation eg caste based reservation and caste based meritocracy
            - Understand changing roles in family eg in family traditional roles like mother expressive, as feminization - > mother enters workforce – nuclear families
            - But Eurocentric based on binary – Asian as modernization of traditional insittuions
    - **Tonnies** also follows similar type of social system
- Action system and Social system (**Structure of social action** and **The Social system**)
    - Action systems don’t exist in real world but are tools to analyze the real world
    - Social actions don’t happen in isolation but in constellations of social actions of individuals known as action systems. 4 Types of action systems
        - Culture system – consisting of beliefs, norms and values; “storehouse of information”; Inspired by **Malinowski**
        - Social system – actual interaction of various units in society. Institutionalized roles create social system
        - Personality system – internal and hidden aspect of society driven by motivations such as love, anger, tension sress alone; inspired by **Mead**
        - Organismic system : biological/ physical aspect of society; called the storehouse of energy
    - These are not real world but tools for analysing the real world
    - Institutionalized social structure called social system
    - Wanted to study how the norms and values of a system are transmitted to actors within the system
    - Conditions for conception of a social system
        - There should be a social interaction between 2 or more individuals
        - For achievement of some collective goal
        - There is a consensus on role expectation
        - They develop an abstract boundary around them
    - While each system maintains its boundaries and are distinct, Social system is linked to other system and influence each other through **knowledge flow and energy flow, which is called cybernetic hierarchy of control**
        - CHC is achieved by socialization and social control
        - Socialization is the transmission of valyes from one gen t another via school or fam
        - Social controls discourage deviance and various inst enforcing it are law/ police etc
    - Social system consists of plurality of individual actors interacting with each other, in a situation which has an environment with actors who are motivated in terms a tendency to optimization of gratification
    - Hence social system has a structure (units/ family/ kinship etc) and functions (performance leads to gratification and attainment of common goals)
    - Functions/ characteristics of a social system include:
        - Social system should have a structure
        - Should be supported by other system
        - Should meet significant need of its members
        - Should have a language
        - Should have a system to affress any disruptive behaviour
    - Developed structural functional theory in phases
        - Social equilibrium is the state of balance both internally amongst social phenomena and to external environment
        - Requisites functional phase (**Social structure**): Functions of **AGIL** framework need to be fulfilled for survival of any society/ structure
            - Adaptation (economic system): need for survival production of goods and services by controlling resources in envt. eg – father earning
                - Fulfilled by organismic system
            - Goal attainment: political system performs this function to define, energize, motivate, mobilise actors to achieve a common goal – determine the goal and achieve the goal
            - Integration: by social institution to maintain harmony and resolve conflict– coherence, solidarity and coordination in system
            - Latency: needs fulfilled by by cultural systems – need for socialization and cultural learnings eg- family, religion, school
        - However, certain factors cause strain in the system.
            - Eg – demographic issues eg – pop, migration, skewed sex ration
            - Tech issues – any tech like AI which can displace employees/ cause unemployment
            - New ideas like French revolution and enlighten, swaraj , Buddhism
            - Physical envt – CC, droughts
        - When soc experiences factors causing strain, society develops re-equilibriumating tendency. It means society evolves in a manner that it can deal effectively with a strain
        - In this process of adaptation, structural differentiation takes place
        - Eg – AI -> law update, edu update
        - Structural adaptation – organs of society re-align themselves to address issues at home
        - Structural differentiation – process of breakdown of roles of an institution and dev of specialized inst to deal with specific role eg -live ins and dating apps, banks, P2P lending, grants, surrogacy/ IVR, counselling
    - Mechanism equilibrium phase (**SOSA**): When specific mechanisms exist, and satisfy needs, there is an equilibrium. If there is a disruption, feedback is passed back to mechanism for a new equilibrium (this is what he called the moving equilibrium); eg - cybercrime
        - “feedback” from the action system to another. Eventually, these new inst will work towards maintaining eq (cybernetic web of control) – hence moving eq.
        - Tendency to restore eq in case disturbed because of any change in a social element
    - Status quoist – no explanation of dictator, rising inequality (Marxists)
    - **Parsons** believed after adaptation and diff, generalization of values is the automated process
    - Eg – edu changes -> we understand its part of system
- change is restorative to bring back equilibrium
- Supremacy of structure over individual in society
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 31.png>)
- Society can be explained in the form of a structure with diff status (status means structural position in social system) and individuals perform roles in each position
- Neglected the role of power or war

### CRITICISM
- Marxists: no focus on conflict theory
- **Mills**: too complex and ignores the role conflict/ inequality of power and authority
- **Merton**: Too abstract and grand – futile and sterile
- Low empirical testability
- **Dahrendorf**: too utopian
- **Jonathan Turner** – suffers from teleology and tautology
- **Dorothy Smith** – ignores gender in social change
- **Coser** – stats quoist and uni-linear
- But imp to understand social problems like poverty (Adaptation) insurgency and communalism (goal attainment), corruption (integration) and society breakdown from **AGIL** framework
- Imp from functional perspective
- Tech innovation + rising pop + failure of eco to adopt – unemployment
- A: India adapting to A – green economy + 3.5 tn
- G: Politics – digital india mission – vision 2070 – vision
- I – laws – green tribunal, DRT, DPDP
- Edu – dink fams, nuclear fams, study envt – transfer information – pattern maintenance
- Limitations
    1. No conflict – doesn’t consider sui – generis protest or social movements in society. envt movements – too consesnusal and value consensus –
    2. Group over resource
    3. who is designing goal – that isnot being studied – ignore feminist point of view
    4. doesn’t explain inequality

## MERTON (NEO-FUNCTIONALIST)
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Gave more practical theories vs functionalists (which are unworkable) and micro theoris (which have limited consequences)
- Disagreement to 3 postulates by structural theorists like **Radcliffe** and **Malinowski**
    - Universal Functionalism :
        - Social reality needs to be seen in terms of a system
        - Structural functionalists believed that **different objects or phenomena** perform function of unity of system
        - But **Merton** believed not all objects or social groups are functional and some may be dysfunctional/ non-functional, which do not contribute to unity of the system
        - **Brown**, **Spencer**, **Durkheim**
        - Eg – nuclear weapons
        - Hence, look at macro and meso level – both societal and group level
    - Functional indispensability:
        - **Brown** and **Parsons**: Some functions are bound to performed by society and **social institutions/ social items** are indispensable for performing these functions
        - Eg – **Parsons AGIL** framework
        - **Merton**: functional alternatives exist and no institution is indispensable
        - They infact lead to social change
        - Eg – creches
        - Eg – caste discrimation is not indispensable
    - Functional unity
        - Social items are not always working for society as a whole but also for some social groups
        - Social and cultural forms / social items are functionable and create positive function for the society
        - **Merton**: need to be studied in the context of the social item
        - Eg – medicinal marijuana or abortion
- Contribution of **Merton**
    - Need to look at net balance study of functionalism – function and dysfunction at both macro and meso levels of society
    - Added levels of society
    - Considered functional as status quoist
- **Merton’s** PoV: These functional theories are non-empirical and abstract. Empirical analysis is critical for functional analysis
- Also suggested a functional paradigm, a systematic approach, to conduct the functional analysis as he believed current functional theories were based on abstract non empirical works.
    - This was an integration of theirie with empirical data and research
    - Social item should be in a standardized pattern (not too abstract or too concrete)
    - Social context needs to be defined
    - General description of social item
    - Primary and secondary data should be used
    - Manifest functions identified
    - Latent functions identified
    - Dysfunctions identified
- Middle range theory
    - Acc to **Merton**, **Parsons** theory of functional structure was too abstract and didn’t encompass all system of concept. It just provided some general orientation as to what variables should be considered in research . hence it was premature and sterile
    - “**Parsons** is trying to be **Einstein** of socio while socio has not even have a **Kepler**”
    - Bridge between raw empiricism and grand theories
    - Characteristics
        - Limited assumptions or generalizations which can be verified
        - Use concepts which can operationalize the gap between theory and empiricism
    - Specific hypothesis followed by empirical evidence to make it concrete instead of grand theories or too specific micro theories
    - The theories will become more reliable, valid, and rightly organized
    - Triple alliance theory of theory, data, method
    - Benefit: empiricism, credibility, testability, reproducibility, reduce time, reduce cost, targeted
    - Disadvantage: Not specific on what constitutes middle?
        - Limited scope of framing universal theories
        - Subjectivity
        - Fragmentation of knowledge because limited social reality and only after extensive research totality
        - **Raymond Bound** – nth but what science uses in theory building
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 32.png>)
- Latent and Manifest functions
    - **Social Theory and Social Structure**
    - Earlier functionalists looked at only manifest functions, whereas his theory combined psychological and socio-cultural functions
    - One is an actual intention of the actor (manifest function – intended, recognized, expected) while other is the unintended function from the action of the actor
        - Unintended has Latent function, latent dysfunction, no function
    - Manifest function is analysed by micro theories, usually non-positivist
        - **Parsons** motivational approach/ inspired by **Weber**
        - Psychological dimension of sociological reality
    - Latent functions often include dysfunctional or unanticipated functions. The actor is unaware and has impact on social structure. This may need both qualitative and quantitative analysis eg. Class and salve domination, dowry, social media isolation, GAI
    - Hopi tribes and rain dance illustration (rain but actually integration )
    - Dysfunctional items may have positive latent functions and negative manifest functions and vice versa
    - Significance: combined positivist non positivist angles; increased scope of socio
    - **Veblen** – used example of conspicuous spending on cars (travel and status)
    - Differentiated between unintended consequences and latent functions, where LF are one type of unintended consequences (which also have latent dysfunction and no function or dysfunction of an action)
    - Partial view of realiy
    - Eg – work from home, reproduction, education,
    - Critique
        - Critics said that when he talked about functional alternative, he really was talking about structural alternatives. Semantic criticism.
        - Critics said that his model failed to predict dysfunction causing circumstances.
        - A status quoist as with latent functions he had effectively legitimised everything.
        - Overemphasis on latent functions, may compromise manifest functions eg one child policy to control national reproduction
        - Difficult to identify latent functions eg – purchasing contributes to GDP, helps in capitalism – leads to alienation
    - PYQ-> unintended consequence vs latent function – eg edu, climate, social media
    - Eg – exam, select student, creates celebs, suicide rates go up, unemployment, rote learners
    - **Colin Campbell** – it is difficult to have clear cut differentiation between latent and manifest; function and dysfunction
- Conformity and Deviance
    - **Social Structure and Anomie**
    - Conformity: action with Orientation to social norms and expectations, and within tolerance prescription of society
    - Deviation: action non-conformity with prescribed norms; reasons for deviation
        - Subculture
        - Parent deprivation
        - Faulty association
        - Differential opportunities
    - Deviance is a result for anomie
    - Deviation can be positive and rewards (Nobel) or negative and punished (such as crime)
    - Anomie: Discrepancy between culturally defined goals and structurally available means to achieve them
    - Gave the **structural strain theory** – individuals feel strain to achieve goals when they don’t have legitimate means to achieve them, which forces them to find alternatives and adopt deviant behaviour- lower class feels the strain more
    - Eg – **American dream** to work in high end jobs needs education (structural means), which may not be available to all; leads to increased crimes from unemployment – feasibility of jounrye from log cabin to white house
    - Developed in backdrop of great economic depression
    - Different types of social actors based on their **adaptive responses**
        - Conformist: accepts the cultural goals and the means available to achieve them, irrespective of their utility or fairness (majority pop such as edu)
        - Innovator: accepts goal but not the means (scientists or thieves, smuggler)
        - Ritualist: accepts means but least concerned about the goal (red tapism, employees)
        - Rebellion: nether accepts goal nor means, but creates alternate means and goals eg social reformers – proponent of counter culture
        - Retreatist: doesn’t accept CULTURAL goals or legitimate means eg alcoholist
    - What may be conformist at one time may be deviant for another time.
    - Every conformist may be deviant at some time and vice versa
    - Many cultures diverge from each other while defining conformity such as LGBTQ
    - Even relevant for understanding traffic issues in India – need to reach on time so take illegitimate means – also confirmed by **Giddens**
    - **Goffman** – we all are socially deviant
    - Criticism theory
        - **Howard Becker** (**Labelling theory reconsidered**): labelling theory said a person is deviant labelled, not for another group but + he is not deviant, he is labelled deviant
        - **Taylor** and **Lemert**: People with power define deviance and not cultural norms; they mark them as deviant
        - **Albert Cohen** – may be developed due to a subculture and not just one individual + didn’t take non-utalitarian crimes into account like vandalism
        - Country can be deviant eg – Pakistan
        - Other reasons than means and goals
        - **Walter Mills** – in lower class communication, delinquency is a learned cult and not anomic reaction to an unattainable goal
    - Hence, understanding anomies and deviances can help develop strategies to address them and prevent deviant behaviour
    ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 33.png>)
- Difference between anomie of **Merton** and **Durkheim**
    - Both analyzede anomie as a state of normlessness but offered diversified views and perspectives to understand the same

- Reference group - **STSS**
    - Contribution to the theory of reference group behaviour
    - A group against which an individual makes comparisons, to evaluate one achievements, aspirations roles etc.
    - Leads to a feeling of relative deprivation
    - Shapes our behaviors, aspirations and perceptions
    - There is an objective criterion i.e. frequency of interaction. The group refers to people who interact reagularly with each other eg – nation not a reference group
    - Used by **Stouffer’s American Soldier** which highlights relative deprivation of American soldier without any actual deprivation
        - Married with unmzarried
        - Married with civilians
        - Abroad with at home
    - Can be positive/ negative – which you want to join or avoid
        - Can be membership/ non-membership
    - Anticipatory socialization – to ease integration with reference group by behaving in the way reference group behaves
        - Aids in him rising up to the group
        - eases in his adjustment to the group
    - Marginal man – who behaves like reference group but is not merged, making him a pariah in his current group
    - Reference group can be based on status, open/ close, achievements etc
    - RG usually has a mode of com from which info about norms etc are gained. Those in authority have substantial knowledge, but authority should exceed the limit – functionally optimum degree of visibility
    - RG can also be a reference individual and not just a group – tr to approximate the role of qualities of the person
    - Can have changing reference groups as interest changes
    - Explains generation gap – diff groups chosen by diff generations
    - Self fulfilling prophecy - prediction that becomes true due the fact that it was a prophecy and re-enforced behavior
    - Used by **Srinivas** for Sanskritization
    - Eg – get in shape looks up to athlete, student who aims to excel looks at class topper
- Contemporary relevance dimensions
    - Conspicuous spending
    - Influence of celebrities and influencers
    - Social comparison
    - Emergence of low end luxury brands
    - Adaptability and migration
    - As a status symbol (eg a graduation cape)
    - acceptance to reference group (eg – tattoo)
    - et insights into the intricate relation between x and y

### CRITICISM
- Added a psychological approach to socio from biological

## GEORGE MEAD
**ROLE TAKING!!!!!**
**Dynamicism, self identity, reflexivity, self objectification**
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- uses symbolic interactionism to analyze the role of social interactions and significant symbols in dev of self and mind
- **CH Cooley** – looking glass self
    - We imagine what other think of us
    - Imagine ow we appear before others
    - We change our mood accordingly
    - This is social self – ability to be both object and subject – think what others are thinking of him
- Chicago school and the father of symbolic interactionism
- **Self and society are twin born**
- Self and society
    - Social act is when two or more people interact and communicate with each other and can **be simple or complex** transactions
    - **Society is sigma of social acts**
    - Gestures are the key mechanism through which social acts **are affected**
    - **Use significant symbol or gesture**
    - Gesture or symbol is basic mechanism of a Social act and can be **verbal or physical**, creating **significant gestures which have a common meaning to the people involved**, esp language which distinguishes humans from others
    - Benefits of significant gestures
        - Gesture and meanings are communicated (language – meaning is also communicated)
        - Elicit the same response between speaker and receiver
        - Potential of effective communication
        - Enables human thinking, which is the interaction between human and his mind; it is the conversation between I and me
    - He also says that social group comes first and it leads to the dev of self conscious mental state
    - Mind and Consciousness is developed due to presence of an existing social group and is responsible for social thinking
    - These symbols are used across different role taking stages to develop the notion of self and mind – and then go
- Self
    - Self: ability to be both object and subject
        - At birth we are devoid of social experiences;
        - We are not born with it; social relations and activities help in development of self; self develops with reflexivity
        - Self rises with human development and social interactions/ relations/ activities
- These interactions are facilitated by symbols and language
    - Mind and self are dialectically related
    - Body is not self; it becomes self when mind is developed
    - **Self and reflexiveness** is important for development of mind. Mind develops within the social process
    - Mind involves thought process oriented towards problem solving
    - Self presupposed social process
    - Once self is developed, it can be maintained even without social contact
    - Reflexitivity – unconsciously put yourself in place of others and act as they act
    - With development of self, People can evaluate themselves as they will be evaluated from outside (**Looking glass self theory of Cooley**). This development of self happens in phases and hence is an **evolutionary process + self helps in internal interaction as well as comm with mind**
    - Understand how to do conversation with others – what is being said and what needs to be said next
    - Over a period of time we start - Role taking by taking role of others and then looking at oneself (reflexivity)
    - This self identity or self awareness takes place as a result of role taking – reflexivity process of how others see us
    - Preparatory stage – as an infant, limited social experience and hence no role taking -> mimics without understanding the behavior
    - Play stage: when the children take particular roles or discrete others and have limited development of self as they start understanding language; lack a more generalized sense of self
        - Eg – doll mother -> understands mother and her are diff – so partial self awareness
    - Game stage: when they grow up, they can become self in full sense; take role of all others (generalized others)
        - Only when we take role of generalized others, we are complete members of society
        - Help in development of organized activities
        - We can do abstract thinking and objectivity
        - But there are many generalized others in the society, because there are many groups in the society
        - As a result each self is different based on the groups it’s a part of
        - Hence it s not that there is no individuality and everyone is a conformist
    - Most likely do what is expected of them to be done
    - Generalized other is the attitude of the entire community
    - People try to live up to group expectations
    - People put themselves in the same experimental field as they put everyone else
- I and me – Dualistic nature of self and relate to social experience.
    - Develop social perception, thinking, self consciousness, social interactions
    - Thinking is simply an internalized or implicit conversation of the individual with himself, by means of such gestures or it is a conv between I and me
    - I – spontaneous, immediate response of individual to others -> less socialized and doesn’t follow reflexivity
        - It is unpredictable and creative
        - Don’t know I – its surprising
        - Leads to novelty, dynamism and helps in developing a definite personality
        - Increasing dominance of I
        - We try to seek I so that we can understand ourselves
        - We are never totally aware of I and know about it only once act has been carried out
        - Imp – key source of novelty, shows our values and realism of self – permits us develop a definite personality
    - Me – Believe how generalized others see us – performs as conforming self
        - Individual acts in the way society expects it to
        - Knowledge about society and self
        - People learn to see who they are by observing responses of others
        - Me is a conventional habitual individual
        - Me involves conscious responsibility
        - Social self develops with the capacity to take role of others
        - Eg – respond as women ->> develop
    - Social control is dominance of me over I
    - So I prevents society from stagnating, while we ensures conformity and allow society to function effectively
    - But lgbtq?
- Inspired **Goffman’s** theory as well of impression mgt

- Origin not known only after 3 stafes
- Deviants are determined by I by me

- Characteristic of modern societies traditional societies
- Hence revolution dominated by I
- He argues that ind in their social interaction process are engaged in constant interaction between I and me - Conv between I and me (dialectics) determines our own socialization
- First reaction of ourself comes from I and is contradicted by self to make it socially acceptable
- Based on immediate reaction of I, me reflects on consequences
- Eg – consider pros and cons before we socialize
- Gave a socio psychological explanation when socio was dominated by macro theories
- Eg- **Ambedkar**

### CRITICISM
- Western ethnocentricism in concept of self – he sys self can exist w/o social conract but ignores the continuing role of social group on dev of self
- Doesn’t consider genetic influence
- **Ropers**: Social activities are discrete episodes and not in continuity according to **Mead**
- **Patrick Baert**: **Mead** saw social life as too consensual.
- Fail to elaborate origin of meaning
- Ignores historical settings and roles
- American determinism – too flexible
- Why all people behave the same way at times? Hence ignored social norms
- Neglected the influence of docial context in action – eg white clothes
- Counter – I brings dynamism to theory
- Explains generational gap

## DURKHEIM (INDISPENSABLE, SOCIAL COHESION, FUNCTIONALISM, SOCIAL FACT, CONCOMITANT, ULTIVARIATE)
**Integration**
**Social control**
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Functionalism – society works in a structured with recurrent patterns; every part has an imp role to play like an organism (developed by **Comte** and **Spencer**)
- Performs functional pre-requisites
- Teleological and tautology - teleology – use consequence as a cause ; taulogy – say the sme thing twice
- Society has its own reality beyond the individuals that comprise it
- Socio is the study of social facts using scientific methods
- – study of individual acts not same as collective behavior : It is a system of interdepdent parts which have functionality ancd indespensibility for maintaining social order
- Didn’t disregard individual factors but believed society has a stronger influence on people
- People’s norms, beliefs have an integrative role – develop collective conscience
- Looked at society and individuals as organs in a living organism
- Concl – understanding role of social facts, can better understand complexities of modern society
- Social facts
    - Social facts are ways of collective thinking, acting and feeling that exist outside individuals but endowed with the power of coercion by which they control him
    - Society is more than the sum of its individual acts AND different than sum of individuals (**sui generis**)
    - Characteristics of social facts
        - External - **Sui generis** (come from their own existence) eg – dometic/ civic/ contractual obligations or **RELIGION**
            - Social realism
            - A philosophy which explain any social institution existing independently of individuals
            - **Sui generis** means – implies that organs come into being with assemble or gathering of individuals
        - Constraining via coercion. It forces itself on individual
        - Generality - identify general types instead of particular types
        - Indepdenent of will of individual and taken collective by a group or society ; he is just a single element in the totality of the relationships which make up the society
    - Focused on both Material and non material social facts (like collective conscience and morality – earlier societies were held together due to strong collective conscience)
        - Material social fact is what is written, codified or directly observable eg const, new criminal laws, religious texts like Quran, housing arrangement
        - Non Material facts – not written or not directly observable SF – eg culture, religion, collective effervescence, social current, social cohesion, morality, value
        - CC maintains social order
        - NM SF are the cause behind SF; hence focus on nonmat SF
    - **ROSM**: Book to explain how SF can be studied empirically through scientific method
    - Rules of studying social fact
        - Rule of observation – study SF as things (naturally existing phenomena), treat individuals as atoms.
            - Atoms are governed by social facts
            - Patterned behaviours of atoms can be observed
            - which when observed show the definite reality rather than considering them as abstract ohenomena. identify objective manifestations of social facts – have definite reality
            - call data on patterned behaviour
        - Rules of classification
            - morphological (give society its appearance – distribution of pop, form of dwelling etc) – they make up substratum of collective life
            - , institutional (accepted by people and institutionalized – general and universalized )
            - non institutional (not accepted but can exert constraints such as a **mob** or sporadic ideas– also called social current)
        - Rules of distinction – normal and pathological state
            - Normal when they exist in the general form and fulfil the function in society. Things which are general and inevitable (crime)
            - Pathological when they deviate from the typical state and may be dysfunctional ; deviation from normal (eg spike in crime)
            - Eg crime – some rate normal
        - Differentiate between type of society
            - Bipolar model of society –
            - Simple or complex society
            - Typification will depend on degree of Specialization
        - Rules of explanation – complete objectivity and personal preoccupations should be kept aside. Yield general theory to establish cause effect relationship
            - Use various methods such as concainment, statistical analysis, indirect observation
            - Yield generalized theories which are not too specific
            - Formulate causal functiona theories ie separate cause and function to prevent illegimitate teleology
            - Eg – cause of infanticide is patriarchy
            - Understand function of social fact – its contribution to maintenance of society disorder
            - Test study of social fact causing another social fact by using comparative method => studied concomitant variation (how social fact was changing across diff groups)
                - Married, single; religious vs atheist
                - So degree of cohesion inversely proportional to suicide rate
                - Compare within society across diff social groups, across societies, within society in diff times
                - Comparative method is not just a mthod but sociology itself
    - Social facts exist in society like nature facts exist in science
    - Social facts help in developing universal laws of sociology
    - Subject matter of Socio should deal with general types instead of particular individual types i.e.e subject matter is social facts
    - Eg – laws, codes, religion, language
    - Book -> **Montesquieu** and **Rousseau** -> talked about principles to establish science of society which is **of general type**
    - **Rules of sociological method** – gave rules of studying the social facts
        - Read SF as things – they are concrete, stay for some time – visible manifestation of a social phenomena
        - May not be tangible but are visible
    - They are not abstract phenomena and can be visualized as objective reality
    - Socio research cannot ignore cause effect phenomena – every SF is caused by another SF
        - Identify cause of SF which lies in another SF
        - Determine function of the SF
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 44.png>)
    - Issues:
        - Individual meanings eg – suicide
        - Official stats
        - Not directly observable
        - Mono causal vs causal pluralism
- DOL
    - Book -> **DOL in society**
    - Developed in background of industrial revoltuon and society held together even with increasing heterogeneity
    - Hedonism / utilitarianism rejected
        - Not based in his pleasure or interest
        - Rejected **Comte** – DOL not reason of disorder in society
    - Splitting of work in smaller parts or processes, undertaken by diff people
    - Not only in economics but even home which is a social phenomena
    - Used evolutionary perspective to show it is a SF – sui generis and independent
    - In simple society, social bond was based on mechanical solidarty
        - Mechanical solidarity was a result of individuals sharing beliefs and lifestyles; means resemblance, character of simple society where people differ as little as possible
        - existed as homogenous units, material density was low (number of people) -> collective conscience V high
        - Also called classless/ primitive society/ tribal society
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 45.png>)
    - Has social controls to ensure conformity to the will of community
    - Repressive laws
    - In Complex society, high organic solidarity
        - OS – inter-dependence due to high specialization of work eg – mobile phone, coaching centre
        - moral density (interaction amongst people), dynamic density increased so organic solidarity
        - dynamic density increase as number of people and interaction amongst them increased
        - as pop increase, demand for resources and occupation increase so specialized stay in this occupation, others make a new occupation -> DOL
        - laws are reformative
        - ideas are empowering but no means to achieve these goals
        - Now as specialization increase, overall resource increase -> heterogeneity of relations -
    - Social bonds exist in both societies, but social bond was different

|   |   |
|---|---|
|- Mechanical solidarity|- Organic solidarity (solidarity in modern society due to interdepdence because of specialization and division of work)|
|- Low material density|- High material density (people migrate to urban areas -> so a conflict possible as people are more than work. So work fragmented and given to people leading to inter-depdendence)|
|- Homogenous units|- Hetero|
|- No specialized DOL|- Specialized DOL and interdepdence|
|- Repressive law|- Restitutive low|
|- higher|- Low social cohesion|
|- Altruistic fatalistic|- Others|
    - Cause – solidarity based on specialized skills
    - DOL functional for society as:
        - Drives integration of society – via dependency ; at subconscious level – dependent even when independent at conscious level
        - autonomy of individual to be innovative
    - individual while trying to be **autonomous** becomes more dependent on society
    - when society transforms from simple to complex, the current of -anomie unleashes (anomie is a state of moral disruption or phase where desires of individuals are not regulated enough)
    - in modern society, desires are unlimited and when they cant fulfil these desires, they go to deviance
    - ways in which society transitions
        - economic boom – with EB, individuals cut away from old social ties and may become atomized
        - economic bust – lose jobs or employment -> cant fulfil dreams, so depression
        - natural disaster – like EQ, cyclone may atomize individuals as they feel alone
        - tech disruptions – like AI will make individuals unemployed
        - abnormal forms of DOL
            - pathological form happens when work is meant for individual well being and not collective well being
            - Anomic DOL
                - When social capital takes precedence over merit
                - anomic happens during transition as **wants and expectations** disrupted – it is a situation where old collective consciousness is absent and new is not achieved
                - people do not follow norms attached to their situation
                - anomie means normlessness and lack of **social cohesion**
                - Promotes SELF INTEREST WHICH IS A THREAT TO ORGANIC SOLIDARITY
                - relevance today – avoids alienation, Expertise such as **Fordism** and **Taylorism** , neet
                - need code of ethics
                - labor generates unhealthy comp and becomes dysfunctional
            - Inadequate coordinated DOL – meaningless tasks and inefficient DOL eg – delayed payments eg MNREGA 36%
            - FORCED dol – comes into force when merit is taken over by ascriptive statuses (eg sex, religion, caste) eg – manual scavengers/ power elite/ a rickshaw puller forced to work in one, glass ceiling (eg – self recruitment theory of Glass). Person starts feeling lower solidarity with the role
        - All of them become atomized and have weakened sense of cohesion among them
    - Hence, need support of state to take action (this was in response to **Adam Smith** theory that DOL is a function of market)
        - State is embodiment of morality and can impart sense of cohesion
        - eg – digital law, trade union, equal wage roles, national suicide policy, moral edu such as ethics paper, MNREGA, state awards like ratnas, Atma nirbhar
        - eg – manual scavengers – state comes into play with manual scavenging prevention act
        - eg – women reservation bill
    - criticized for being top down + underplayed role of economic factors
        - **Harry Braverman** – ignores the degradation of work
        - **David Lockwood** – confuses inter depdendence with integration (social vs system integration)
        - **Merton** – dysfunctional aspects of work + strain theory – not only normlessness but srain
        - **Malinowski** – criticizes for equating DOL with progress
        - **Ulrich Beck** (**Risk societies**) – reflexive modernization – uncertainty of labor market due to human made risks
        - Cant explain forced attrition
        - **Talcott Parsons** questioned the applicability of **Durkheim’s** concepts to non-Western societies, arguing that the distinction between mechanical and organic solidarity may not be relevant in differen cultural contexts.
- Suicide
    - **Le Suicide**
    - Way of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative action performed by the victim himself and which he knows will produce this result (led to inter subject reliability)
    - **Durkheim** claim as a social fact clear shift from considering it a psychological phenomena. He never wanted to study individual phenomena but why
        - Why suicide diff in diff societies
        - Why rate almost constant
        - Why changes from one group to another in society
    - Suicide rate: rate of suicides per lakh pop
    - He used rules of sociological method and applied scientific method to study suicide rate
        - Data frompolice official stats
        - Data classification based on religion, marriage, age etc
        - Analyzed any correlation between 2 variables (degree of cohesion as part of group and suicide rate) and used concomitant method to prove no correlation between psychological or alcohol rates
        - Did **multivariate analysis** – in order to understand which variable has had higher impact on suicide, kept few variables constant and studied relation with others
        - Developed causation: social cohesion defines rate of suicide
        - Generalization – higher cohesion, lower suicide rate
    - He studied 2 types of societies: simple society and complex society and found that since simple have higher cohesion, lesser suicide rates vs complex have lesser cohesion so higher suicide rate
    ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 46.png>)2 types of bonds integrate individuals with society - forces of **integration** and forces of **regulation**
    - anomic/ fatalistic –
        - Anomic
            - when normlessness leads to suicide, anomic
            - no rules to protect individuals
            - new standards not developed and existing are not accepted
            - talks about 2 different types of anomic – economic anomie and domestic anomie
            - can be chronic (prolonged) or acute (all of a sudden)
            - chronic economic anomie – prolonged economic distress eg farmer suicides
            - acute economic – economic depression
            - chronic domestic – extreme isolation eg Dalits/ SC/ ST
            - acute domestic – divorce
            - **Merton** says happens due to anomie
            - eg – “Blue whale challenge”, reverse migrants, farmer suicides in case of uncertainity
        - Fatalistic – such excess regulations that person feels suffocated and death is the only solution eg , 50+ suicides in colombo prison in 2023, rape victim, slaves
        - rate of suicide inversely proportional to degree of solidarity
    - altruistic/ egoistic
        - Altruistic
            - over integration – traditional
            - degree of integration is extremely high and individualism is dead
            - unquestioned integration to society
            - high degree of organic solidarity
            - married have less suicide
            - eg – suicide bombers/ Sallekhana/ hunger strikes
        - Egoistic- too focused on individual interests that at pinaccle of success, he realizes what he has lost in life eg farmers (death every 2 hours in 2021), SC students in IIT, Kota mechanical coaching, celebrity suicide
    - did a multivariate analysis based on social factors and material factors + conclusions
        - Suicide is a social phenomena – no relation with material factors
        - Suicide is a social fact
        - Took police data
        - No relaltion between suicide and non social phenomena like stress or race or alcoholism ( Looked at geo and psychological causes also but no correlation)
        - protestant
            - protestant have higher suicide because they live a life of work and solidarity
            - they have more space for achievement as allowed
            - so they do not have social bondage
            - they look at the success of other achieves – feel life is wasted
            - they marry late or don’t marry - workaholics
            - in case of church, since social bondage is high – the group gives them strength to survive
        - Elderly – less likely to do suicide as they know their years are limited and hence live life more
        - Teenagers – more suicide as their attachment and social bondage is weak – solidarity with community is weak
        - Man rate more than women- no relation between alcoholism, emotion or drugs – they do that to enjoy life
        - Climate and suicide
            - Winter – less deaths as more festivals so higher social solidarity
            - Ritual is a social battery
            - It is not the climate but the ritual estivities that decide rate of suicide
        - Rate of suicide is same across traditional and modern societies – it is just that rate of suicide is reported in modern society
        - Socio is concerned with rate of suicide and not incident of suicide
        - Universal phenomena - certain rate is normal
        - Underdeveloped countries have less rate of suicide
    - Suicidogenic current (suicidogenic impulse) – while individual factors play a role (psychological pre disposition), society plays major rule to push – collective tendencies that dominate the susceptible individuals an catch them in their sweep
    - **Robert Beard** – more suicides in modern society rather than traditional society
    - **Jean Bachelor** -> developed individual suicides typology
    - Once suicide is committed, society Readjust forces to restore normal rate
    - Solution to suicide
        - Family does not provide enough support + state is too authoritiative
        - So need an institution suchas corporates which is superior to labour unions which just intsensify the differences with managers
        - These are occupational groups
    - In india
        - Farmer
            - A: Without benefits of govt support reaching them
            - F: due to forced labor and sharecropping
            - E: when crop fails and he feels isolated under debt
            - Al: whole family commits suicide
        - Women
            - A: With marital rape not decriminalized
            - F: Lack of employment
            - E: Hyper reality and zero figure / glass ceiling/ glass cliff
            - Al: Save honour of fam after rape
        - Youth
            - A: Blue whale
            - F: Kota
            - E: Isolation and peer group
            - Al: parent expectation
    - Distinct methods used:
        - Concomitant
        - Multi variate analysis
        - Inter reliable def
        - Use of sociological concepts
        - Comparative analysis
        - Longitudinal studies
- Religion (social cohesion, solidarity, sacred profane collective effervescence)
    - It is not an individual experience/ **supernatural inspiration** but a social experience external to an individual
    - Studied religion in a simple and promitive society of Arunta tribe
    - Defined religion in **Elementary forms of religious life** USING functionalist perspective
    - **Unified system of beliefs** and practices **relative to the sacred things**, that is to say things set **apart and forbidden**. Beliefs and practices which **unite in one single community** called a church those who adhere to them
    - Features of religion
        - When people come together, it creates a phenomena called traditional, practices, rites or rituals of individuals
        - These rituals will take place around a totem;
            - Can be an animal/ vegetable inaminate objects, Tree which represents a collective representation of collective sentiment
            - Totem becomes the representation of the clan – jal, zameen, jungle
            - Totems are the most elementary form for dev of religion and explain origin of religion
        - Totem was considered sacred (apart and forbidden) and rest of world was ordinary (eg ganga vs other rivers)
        - Gives totemic principles: Workship of totem meant worship of collective sentiment ; hence religion is nth but society’s own worship
        - towards sacred – can be positive or negative
    - **Durkheim** identified 4 types of rites
        - **Sacrificial** rites – specifiy and regulate the obligations that objects have towards the group
        - **Imitative** rites – can imitate similar to the totem for purpose of reproduction
        - **Commemorative** rites – how the group represents itself to others
        - **Piacular** rites – represent loss or suffering
    - FUNCTIONS
        - Euphoria: brings highly excited state of affairs among individuals, It transcends individuals from world of profane and sacred
        - Social cohesion and integration : brings people together or binds them into a social bond (eg WC got Indians together)
        - social control : regulates desires of individuals and keep their needs limited. Makes them conformist and evades deviance
        - social cognition – it gives cognitive capacity to individuals to explain inexplicable, tolerate intolerable, poverty, death, failure
        - Collective conscience – provides a **sense of identity**
        - Now : PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING eg meditation AND EMOTION SUPPORT
        - Ramayana helped during Mahabharat
        - Can be a base for social change eg nationalism
    - Cause of religion is Sense of collective effervescence - they feel empowered by a source greater than self
    - New forms in modern times
        - Any practice that brings people together in a common belief around what they regard as sacred can classify as religion
        - Elections – idea of India
        - **Bellah** – seen in civil religion of flag, cricket etc
        - Cricket
        - Nationalism like republic day – civil religion and Indian flag is the totem
        - Constitution
        - Social movements like LGBTQ, Feminist movements
        - Tribal worship of rivers and trees
        - Rise of “cult of individual ” – person as sacred eg **Osho** , hathras case – sacred – no feet touch
    - SACRED – things which are **transcendental and extraordinary** with moral superiority ->
    - Profane are things which are mundane – part of everyday life
    - Totem is symbolic manifestation of kinship and society - easier to direct feelings towards a thing rather than complex society

### CRITICISM
- **Merton** – need mid range theories
- **Weber** – social facts don’t exist on their own as pebbles to be gathered on the beach -> leads to methodolical challenges
- **Peter Berger** – injustice by ignoring individual human behavior
- **Heidleman** – too busy explaining society that he didn’t explain any method for it
- **Coser** – too much importance to society, ignores individual
- Too universalistic and do not have practical significance

- Couldn’t explain why same social fact has diff impact on diff people
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 54.png>)
- Too grand so ignore nuances
- **Giddens** – apparent moral ambiguity between individual and society in the modern world
- **Tarde** – difficult to understand how society exists w/o individual
- **Stephen Lukes** (**Power – a radical view**) – neglected emotions and individual behaviour
- **Anthony Giddens** – didn’t consider the interplay between material and non material faycs which are intertwined and have a symbiotic relation to shape human behavior
- Suicide
    - Called empirical generalization
    - **Atkinson** (**discovering suicide**) – quality of data
    - Didn’t include attempted suicides
    - Need to focus on causal pluralism approach which is more comprehensive and holistic
    - **Gibbs** and **Martin** – not positivist as suicodogenic not empirically measured
    - **Raymond Arcon** – need to focus on personal experiences of people
    - Why only a few commit suicide?
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 55.png>)
- Can use high integration, high regulation on x, y axis

## CHAPTER 5

## INEQUALITY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Intro
    - Modern idea of equality emerged from enlightenment as well as rise of capitalism with bourgeoise challenging nobility hereditary rights
    - Social differences are historical, but attachment of value to these differences leads to inequality
    - Different individuals are associated to different groups and evaluated differently
    - Equality means members of society have equal access to wealth, power, prestige etc
    - Patterns of difference in access to social -economic opportunities and resources lead to social inequality
    - Can be micro or macro (developed vs developing vs underdeveloped vs least developed countries)
    - It is a mental construct via differentiation (people with differences), ranking (preliminary ranking based on comparison), evaluation (attaching values to the differences), rewarding
    - **Andre Beteille** -> Inequality can be harmonic (inequality preached as a practice eg caste historically) or disharmonic (where preached vs practice are different)
- Reasons
    - **Rousseau**: 2 types of inequality (physical and moral/ political)
    - **Bourdieu**: 4 types of inequality and deprivation (economic capital, social capital, cultural capital, symbolic capital); these capitals may overlap – ALWAYS USE IN INEQUALITY
    - **Marx**: Due to difference in ownership of means of production and dependency theory
    - Functionalists: Inevitable to be able to perform all jobs
    - **Haralombus** and **Holborn** (**Sociology – themes and perspectives**): Inequality of power and inequality of material well being. They become repressive when aggressilevly enforced such as slavery
    - **Peter Saunders** – equality of 3 types – legal equality, equality of outcome, equality of opportunity (meritocracy – everyone has an equal chance of becoming unequal)
- Impact
    - Such inequalities lead to poverty and deprivation (**Merton**)
        - Deprivation has multiple dimensions such as health edu sanitation info legal aid etc
        - can be absolute or relative deprivation
    - **Goran Therborn** (**the killing fields of inequality**): Analyzed types and impact of inequality incl. ill health, crime, discrimation, poverty, health edu; exclusion of poor has to be eliminated
        - caused by **systematic arrangements**, processes and distributive actions, both individual and collective
    - **Wilkinson** and **Pickett** (**The spirit level: why more equal societies almost always do better**)– not only harmful for individual but also dysfunctional for society
    - **Bryan Turner** (**EQUALITY**) – Equality includes fundamental equality of a person,, equality of opportunity, equality of condition, equality of outcome
- Contemporary
    - Modern measures: GINI Coefficient, human development index
    - Provisions: Constitution DPSP, FR, Schemes like PDS, DBT, Subsidies, social security, progressive taxation
    - India: 10% people hold 70% wealth
    - **Sen** – I believe all problems in the world come from inequality of one kind or another
    - Equality can be legal, political, economic, social
- Talent Allocation: • Increased mobility can lead to a more efficient allocation of talent,
- Social and Cultural Integration: • Mobility can promote greater social and cultural integration,

## POVERTY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Intro
    - **John Sinclair** and **FM Eden** - Social problem involving lack of access to material resources required for basic subsistence and minimum standard of life (**Amartya Sen** and mdp)
    - **Ruth Lister** (**Poverty**) – definition of poverty has important implications for **political, policy and academic** discourse
        - Defined in economic and material well being terms only
    - Absolute poverty (poverty line at 1.9), relative poverty such as **Stauffer’s American soldier** or multi-dimensional poverty (imp for socioligists to evaluate if other needs beyond basic economic needs are also being met for a decent quality of life)
- Dimensions
    - Dimensions of poverty: social, cultural, digital, political, info, health, edu, finance
- Causes
    - Causes of poverty: economic, social, cultural factors
    - **Different views on origin and prevalence of poverty**
        - Blame the poor (limited motivation) or blame the system approach (limited avenues for social mobility)
        - The cultural perspective
            - (**Oscar Lewis** – social atmosphere of poor perpetuate poverty); tribals are poorer than average population by more than 40%. This happens due to world view, aspiration, experiences
            - Poverty not a result of individual shortcomings but the culture
        - Viscous cycle/ poverty trap – poverty to poor edu to poverty
        - Functional theories (**Herbert Gans** in **More Equality**)
        - Dialectical approach (**Marx**) and mismatch between use value and exchange value of labor
        - Feminist approach
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 56.png>)
        - **Diana Pearce** – disproportional women in poor due to lack to opportunity, male bias, household chores, wage pay, unpaid domestic work, lack of skills
            - **Glass ceiling**
            - **Pink collarization**
            - **Glass cliff**
            - Environment impact on women: more women are expected to be impacted by climate change than men
            - Poverty of women hidden in poverty of household study
        - Power and poverty (**Milband** – poor are the weakest in struggle for scarce resources)
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 57.png>)
        - Institutions (**Myrdal** – lack of education and political systems)
        - **Prahlad** – poverty need not be looked at from benevolent perspective – capitalists can earn while making lives better
        - **Rajni**, **AR Desai**, inequality, migration
- Types of poverty
    - Economic poverty
    - Information poverty – no linkedin, edu,
    - Energy poverty – deprivation of electricity – lack of access to water, internet , social exclusion
    - Capability poverty – deprivation of capaibiluty – capability to earn
    - Culture poverty – **Oscar Lewis** – limit goals – social exclusion but living for today
- Exclusion to poverty
    - Social exclusion from labor market - Student, unemployed, retired
    - From social relations – transgenders, “othering”, minorities HIV, disabled
- Many other factors can lead to dev of both
- Solutions to poverty
    - Redistribution of wealth
    - Marxists socialism
    - Inst reforms with schools
    - Feminist – protection laws eg equal wages act
    - reservation
- Concl
    - **Aristotle** – poverty is the parent of revolution and crime
    - **Shastri** – we cannot afford to spend millions and millions on nuclear arms when we have poverty all around us
    - **Gandhi** – poverty is the worst form of violence
    - **Gandhi** – a nation’s greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members
    - **Nelson Mandela** – overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity but an act of justice
    - **Mandela** – poverty is not accident. Like apartheid, it is man made and can be removed by actions of human beings
- **Ruth Lister** – women are over-represented in poverty while they face other kinds of deprivation even within the household

### CRITICISM
- Intersectionality – black homo poorafrican women – low life chance
- Techniques or tool to understand interwing or interpay of multiple marginalizing identities on individuals
- **Kimberle Crenshaw**
    - She argues we must use intersectional angle while analyzing gender, race inequality
    - Understand inequality more comprehensively
- Gender intersects with all other dimensions and not influence all by itself
    - So gender class eg – poor woman eg MNREGA
    - Gender intersect race – black woman

## EXCLUSION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Intro
    - **Haralambos**: Situation where multiple deprivations prevent participation in social activities
    - **Ruth Lister**: Prevention of having the same opportunities that are available to majority population (Book: **Poverty**)
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 58.png>)Dimensions
- **Amartya Sen** – exckusion is not ltd to food, shelter and clothing but political participation, access to edu, health, sanitation etc
- **Mary Daly**: concept is wider than poverty as not only economic inclusion but other dimensions also in social processes
- **Anthony Giddens** – homelessness worst form of social exclusion as deprives from other services
- **Merton** – deliberate exclusion due to anticipatory socialization and marginal man
- **Marx** saw exclusion as a form of alienation
- Characteristics
    - **Weber** – form of social closure where one group attempts to secure a privileged position for themselves and prevents others from becoming a part of the group
    - Usually systematic and not accidental based on societal structure; is intentional
    - Can be individual or collective
    - Social exclusion
        - Stratification and poverty increase exclusion
        - Curtailment of social rights and privileges
        - Exclusion from friends family or society
- Types of exclusion
    - From social rights
    - Education (**Oscar Lewis**- discrimination in labor market may prevent inv in edu) + (exc from schools after class 8)
    - Homelessness (worst acc to **Giddens** as automatically excludes others)
    - Political rights
    - Religious
    - Educational
    - Health
    - Financial and credit
    - Societal participation (dalit entering temple)
    - Labour market (white black)
    - Lead to high delinquent behavior (**Elliot Curie**)
    - Can lead to alienation
    - IR – Africa/ N korea/ Russia
- EG – LGBTQ, Women, Caste system, Apartheid in South Africa
- Steps – const, UNDHR, Reservation, RTE
- **Sen** – progress is more plausibly judged by reduction of deprivation than by further enrichment of opulent

## SOCIAL STRATIFICATION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Intro
    - **Tumin** – arrangement of any social group or society hierarchy of positions that are unequal with regard to power, property, social evaluation and psychic gratification
    - **Sutherland** and **Maxwell**: As a process of differentiation, which places some people higher than others
    - Structural hierarchy with some strata placed above others
- Process
    - 4 steps followed:
        - Differentiation (which may exist naturally or by society and can be perceived by people in society)
        - Evaluation: evaluate in terms of prestige, status, honour, income etc, leading to inferiority/ superiority
        - Ranking: when different strata are compared
        - Reward: reward/ punish different strata based on the evaluation and ranking attached
- Types
    - Can be open or closed stratification. Open stratification has social mobility to move from one strata to another (eg, bureaucracy)
    - But stratification need not always be hierarchical; **Dipankar Gupta**: “**it will be futile and even capricious to hierarchize languages or religions or nationalities**
- Sources
    - **Bottomore** defined 4 types of social stratification traditionally – slaves (vs citizens), estate (during feudal time – nobility, clergy and serf), caste (SS by birth), class (by economic factors)
- Social stratification by functionalists
    - Stratas exist to be able to perform certain functions/ menial jobs in the society
    - **Parsons**:
        - Every society is based on consensus of norms and values due to cybernatic
        - He said there are differential rewards for differential strata in society
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 59.png>)
        - These differential rewards lead to stratification
        - Stratification is inevitable as value consensus s an integral part of all types of society
        - functional requisites, explaining each function is a pre-requisite to the survival of a social system.
        - Critique
            - **Dahrendorf**: stratification is a result of closely related trinity of power, norms and sanction and not only functional pre-requisites
            - Elite self recruitment not considered
            - **Turner**: structural Functionalism struggles with illegitimate teleologies
            - **Beck** and **Baudrillard** – caste system rigidity cant be explained and now, inequalities are more individual based
            - **Gouldner** – social stratification not inevitable and criticizes for justifying inequality
            - Also, **Parson’s** theory exist only if everyone has equal opportunities
    - **WL Warner**
        - Further propagated the concept of differential rewards based on social status as a base of stratification
        - Social status – edu, occupation and income
        - _The social life of modern community_
    - **Davis** and **Moore** (**Some principle of social stratification**)
        - **MERITOCRACY**
        - **SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND INEQUALITY**
        - **ROLE ALLOCATION**
        - **VALUE CONSENSUS**
        - **SCARCITY OF TALENT AND DIFFERENTIAL REWARD**
        - **MOTIVATION**
        - **COMPENSATION**
        - Human societies are universally stratified
        - Some positions are seen as functionally more imp than others
        - Talent is considered scarce and hence social stratification is a way of attracting talented and meritocratic people in role allocation to fill more imp positions
        - These positions are exclusive and less in number
        - A lot of people are dependent on them
        - More important positions are paid a higher reward since they have talent and skills which are unique, and its needed to motivate them to service these positions
        - They have to sacrifice when they undergo training as some functions are more important than others
        - Hence social stratification is inevitable in any society
        - Rewards attract as an incentive to attract these people – status, wealth, power
        - They don’t question system but accept, creating a value consensus in society
        - Relevance in India – NEET, UPSC, SSC - np, as power is a more dominant source of inequality rather than awards + people of same talent get occupy higher position
        - Critique
            - **Melvin Tumin**: Opposed **David** and **Moore**
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 60.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 61.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 62.png>)
            - Difficult to determine relative importance of positions in an objective manner, talent and mobility
            - Rewards are not correlated with importance of position eg – a corporate slave vs chief minister (high importance, low reward) or SRK vs IAS
            - It is not the only motivational factor
            - If merit was sole criteria, then weaker sec would not have been underrepresented – so No equal opportunity eg UNDP data, IIM has upper class professors
            - Dysfunctional because it makes barriers to entry for underprivileged, reducing talent availability
            - Lead to maintenance of status quo, even when its dysfunctional and resulting in hostility
            - Trainees are not making a sacrifice other than suspended income
            - Social stratification is not always unity but prmote conflict – civil liberation movement
            - Countered by **David Moore** – judge based on uniqueness
            - **PINK COLLARIZATION**, **SOCIAL CAPITAL**, **STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS**, **GLASS CEILING**, **CASTE BASED CONSTRAINTS**, **POVERTY AND INEQUALITY**
- **Marx**
    - Strat refers to economic and vertical division in society
    - Stratification based on ownership of means and forces of production
    - Structure: have/ have nots
    - A minority has ownership of resources, leading to oppression of the lower strata who don’t own these resources
    - Hence product of dialectical materialism, unequal ownership and subsequent class formation
    - Consequence: class struggle
    - Universality: end of stratification with communism
    - **Charles Murray** – concept of underclass – people with little bargaining power and at mercy of employer eg minority and women
    - Critique
        - Social mobility will increase in future, with emergence of welfare state and middle class
- **Weber**
    - Saw stratification in a multi-dimensional view of class, status and power called **trinitarian model**
    - Happens because of unequal distribution of property, prestige, power
    - Class:
        - Defined class as a group of people with similar positions in the economic or market position, because of which they have similar life chances
        - Not a community
        - Related to unequal distribution of economic rewards
        - People with similar life chances have similar class
            - Life chance is level of opportunity to access good standard of life
        - Based on education and skills and not means of Production ownership
        - 4 classes: propertied upper class, property less white collar, petty bourgeoisie, manual workers
        - Have different skills and ownership on means of production
        - No evidence of polarization – instead middle class will swell (proliferation of MC)
        - No difference of community feelings (unlike **Marx**) – not a homogenous group because diff interests and prestige enjoyed differentiate their collective - consciousness
        - No abolition of pvt property – equality not necessary, infact it will take new forms
    - Status group
        - **Social group awarded similar amount of honor and share same position**
        - These are communities
        - Can be status group (a group of people enjoying honour from majority of individuals) or status less group
        - Related to unequal distribution of honour
        - Practice endogamy eg – inter caste
        - They follow certain rules and manners
        - Pass on same value system to next gen
        - Enjoy prestige due to their lifestyle (Refers to way of life chosen by individual)
            - Internal to individual – choice is individuals
            - Eg – IAS officer 2 sons – each has same life chance but diff lifestyle
            - Defines honour inequality in society (lifechance defines eco inequalities in soc)
            - Doesn’t necessarily lead to status inequalities
        - Eg – president delegation, exclusive clubs like gymkhana, sherpas, brahmans
        - Closed status group (closure)
        - Possession of property, and resource not always associated with status
        - Dependent on multiple factors such as knowledge, occupation, income, honour, social capital etc.
        - Consumers of goods and not producers of goods
        - Aware of their status eg Brahmins or untouchables
        - Traditional societies – ascriptive, modern societies achievement based
        - Usually more closed groups and have certain qualifiers for others
        - **Pakulski** and **Waters** – status is becoming more imp than economic class as cons is based on status (eg spending on marriage based on status and not economic capacity)
    - Party
        - Parties are structures who want to gain power (be at state or non state institution)
        - Usually represent class or status groups (not always)
        - Parties of patronage and parties of principle
    - Hence he concluded power property and prestige not necessarily correlated. Goes against Marxist idea of eco as deterministic factor
    - Application
        - Socio economic caste census – looks at diff
        - Surveys are very comprehensive
        - Eg – global gender gap, MDI
    - Critique
        - **Cellia Heller**: Status and class often inter related
            - Counter – usually bit not always + homo a status group across classes
        - **Ulrich Beck**:
            - Risk based stratification - inequality based on risk taking capability
            - Induced by modern society such as terrorism, innovation etc
        - Marxist – conflict theory
        - Feminist – ignores gender stratification
        - **Runciman** – 7 classess and not 4
        - **CW Mills** – new type of power elite
    - Illustrations
        - Individual with wealth may command little prestige or power eg = lottery, inherit wealth
        - Individuals with status may not have wealth eg – social woker, great Thunberg, people who are ascetics
        - With status but no power – eg ex PM, e x bureucrats, celebs
        - Status could be source of power – media ccelebs, Kangana ranaut
        - Wealth could be source of power – ambani
    - Reality is **multi dimensional if unit of analysis is individual actor**, class power status may not correlate. This analysis brings us **closer to individuals in every day** life insyead of **Marxian class abstraction**
    - **Inspired AB**

## RACE BASED STRATIFICATION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Concept of race was propagated by Europeans in 17th century to promote Whites as superiors
- Race is defined a group of people perceived different from others often based on their history, ancestors, birth and physical characteristics, molded by dominating group in the society
- It is riddled with prejudice and discrimination based on observable differences between people
- Loaded with prejudices, stereotypes and preconceived notions
