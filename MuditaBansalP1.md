## SOCIOLOGY - the Discipline
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Irving Zeitlin**: socio was reaction to enlightenment (**ideology and dev of sociological theory**)
- Socio helps us not only to be more analytical but also understand individuals, groups and institutions around us as well as their interaction with each other
- Europe 3 phases of modernity
    - Dark age -> religious and God centric (no logic)
    - Emerged in response to **social and intellectual climate of Europe**
    - Sociology the Product of clash between enlightenment (individuals) and counter enlightenment ideas (society at core)
    - Enlightenment refers to the intellectual movement concerned with governance and economy
    - Dark ages and Era of enlightenment (intellectual movement) -> ideological modernity – **13-17 century**
    - Focus on humanism – human centric lifestyle. **INDIVIDUALISM empricisim and rationality**
    - **Led by**
        - **Voltaire** – free speech
        - **Hobbes** and **Locke** – natural rights – life, liberty and property
        - **Rousseau** – general will (will of majority) + every one had one vote
        - **Marry Wollstonecraft** – life liberty and property for gender equality
        - **Adam Smith** – free market economy – laissez faire and invisible hand + progressive taxation + specialization and DOL
        - **Montesquieu** (separation of power and const)
    - Renaissance – rebirth driven by new thinking – upheaval of art, architecture, ideas, literature
    - French rev – political modernity – rule of law and citizenship – 18 century – liberal democracy and concept of republic
    - Industrial rev – technological modernity – An era which involved mass production, factory system and standardization of production
        - Led to separation of work and home (**sexual DOL**) and time based production + efficiency + bureaucracy
    - Scientific revolution -> **Copernicus** – hello centric theory and **Kepler** – elliptical theory
    - Modernity refers to departure from tradition driven by intellectual forces and characterized by individualism, equality, humanism, democracy, free market, nation state and empiricism

### Emergence of Socio
- Counter enlightenment -> involved questioning the French, industrial and enlightenment. These have disturbed social order and caused lawlessness or anarchy. 2 groups emerged – modernist and conservatives / skeptics (Modernists romance with modernity); these were judgmental so a group emerged to take a balanced approach and study modernity
    - Crime rates , suicide, homelessness, divorce, reign of terror (**August Comte**, **E Durkhiem**, **Louis de Bonald** conservatives against enlighternment)
    - Man was no longer the owner of the product (alienation) + slum formation + economic inequality (**Karl Marx** radical)
    - Feudal to industrial society; capitalism, nation state, bureaucracy, change in household and kinship, middle class, Economic and cultural upheaval + social stratification with emergence of **nobility, clergy and commoners**
- Critiscism – **Bottomore** – encyclopedic and radical
    - Intellectual antecedents influenced socio incl.
        - philosophy of history (society progressed through stages of evolutions eg **Karl Marx** dialectical materialism, **Spencer’s** organismic theory)
        - biological philosophy
        - social survey – methods of natural sciences to socio eg poverty
        - social reform movement
        - rise of feminism and thought
- modernity is not homogenous and of varied nature. Assuming as only place is equal to colonization of modernity
- **SN Eisenstadt** -> multiple modernity such as Indian modernity (**Yogendra Singh** caste based political party, Indian secularism which is equidaistant, Indian socialism, Russian and Chinese socialism/ communism, SE Asian – satellite capitalism + hub for import/ export), dependent modernity of Latin America
    - India – caste based political parties; indian secularism, DPSP and social welfare
    - Bhutanic modernity green growth and happiness index
    - Chinese Russian – one party political modernity
    - Latin America – language modernity but traditional economy
- Hence modernity is a universal phenomena
- Chicago school issues – racism, orphanage for children and elderly, hunger and malnutrition, gender equality at workplace -> **Jane Addams** + **Du Bois** (Black men living dual consciousness – established hull house) -> had social reformist orientation
    - **Micheal Burawoy** – public sociology
    - **Schwendinger and Schwendinger**: early American sociologists were political liberals
    - Class and harmony cooperation
    - Majorly civil war after civil war
    - **Furnham**: Americans saw positive possibility of industrialization, but also aware of danger; Europeans were reactionary
    - **Stanford**: heavily influenced by Protestantism, which led to view socio can be interested in social reforms
    - **Veblen**: leisure class foster wasteful consumption
    - **Robert Park** – Chicago school – go to field and get data
    - Later America socio – melting pot socio, **Berger**, **Parsons**, **Luckman**
- Frankfurt school – **Adorno**, **Bauman** emphasized departure from core principles of enlightenment
- **Conclusion** – Hence, existing disciplines couldn’t answer societal changes and hence socio emerged as the “science of society”

### Early Thinkers
- So initiated with roman civilization – had a “city state” where political consolidation and progressive society; however, non -propsperous city states aged war
- Conquerors declared themselves as kings – barbaric state started
- Now people were miserable and needed help – church emerged with pope and bishop to advice the king
- But king paid off bishop and priestly class became agents of God
- Books against church came
    - **Thomas More** – **Utopia** - questioned church and the concept of after life
    - **Montaigne** – **What do I know** – humans have ltd knowledge and so do church about religion
    - **Rene Descartes** – I think and therefore I exist
    - **David Hume** – every religion glorifies body of miracles – those who benefit from it promote it
    - **John Locke** – man by nature is rational (establish a relation between means and goal) + initiated rule of law and separation of power
    - **Calvin** and **Martin Luther** – god has created both paradise and earth. So earth is equally sacred as paradise
- early thought of **Darwin’s** organismic evolution theory – imp influence on socio
- **Comte** – founder of socio - scientific discipline
- **Simon** – ethical socialism
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 1.png>)
- Counter enlightenment ideas also
- **Durkheim** - when an old society is disintegrating, it has a transition period where some people follow traditional vs other follow modern elements; so no unanimity ; need reforms

**_Intellectual forces_**: Changes incl eco (industrial), social, political (French)
- _Black ages Dawn of modernity challenges quest for ans_

### Scope of Socio
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 2.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 3.png>)
- **MOTHER OF ALL SOCIAL SCIENCES**
- Not first discipline – historians collected data in specific format
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 4.png>)
- No real consensus on scope of socio
- Started with a macro view (**Comte**), evolved to micro (**Weber**), further dynamic to synthetic
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 5.png>)
- **Sprott**: brave attempt to confine mass of slippery material into simple system of pigeonholes
- Influenced By Science
- Influenced by social philosophy
- 3 approaches – inductive, synthetic, formal
    - Inductive – empirical approach
        - **Comte** – socio is the mother of all sciences
        - **Comte** – social positivism – **SOCIAL STATISTICS AND DYNAMICS**
        - **Spencer** – organismic
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 6.png>)
    - Synthetic
        - French sociologist believed socio can study anything and everything
        - Called synthetic tradition of sociology – can study anything and everything
        - **Durkheim** – 3 parts of socio – social morphology (pop related aspect), social physiology (bodily parts of society such as family), general socio (develop theories)
        - **HOBHOUSE** – all other disciplines should come and merge with socio
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 7.png>)
    - Grand theories to explain cause effect relationships
    - **Karl Mannheim** – 2 types of socio - general socio and historical socio – but has problem of comparison and socio dynamic
    - Scope of socio is limitless
    - Suffers from sociocentrism
    - Mutual exchange and mutual stimulation
- Formal – pure and independent; focus on micro elements , SUOR
    - German school which recognizes the limitations of socio due to the subject matter of the study
    - Say socio is branch of social science
    - Has its own methodology
    - Socio is not the queen, rather diff from other social sciences
    - **George Simmel** – human behavior can be classified as formal behavior and actual behavior
    - Social life is dynamic
    - **Tonnies**, **Weber**, **Simmel**
- **Parsons** and **Merton** – combined (SOSA and latent manifest)
- Post modernists – reject meta-narratives
    - Socio evolved from positivism to here due to diff schools of thought
    - **Micheal Focault** – alternate institutions like old age, prison + health, ageing
    - **Anthony Giddens** - Double Hermeneutics i.e. everyday lay concepts and of social sciences have a 2 way relationship
    - **Alan Bryman** – hallmark of post modernist sociology is “purposive sociology” iei pluralist methodology based on the need of subject matter
    - **Zygmunt Bauman**
- Contemporary – gives importance to envt, women, public policy
    - In global times – climate change, new forms of kinship
    - Evolved from merely Eurocentisim
    - Man on earth, not just one nation
    - Role of social media
    - Deviance and anomie rising crime
    - Suicides from edu
    - New forms of marriage
    - Digital sociology

### CRITICISM
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 8.png>)
- **Maciver and Page** _– society is a web of relationships_

## HISTORY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Radcliffe Brown** – history is Idiographic vs socio is normative
- Specific vs generic
- Similarity vs difference
- Descriptive vs analytical
- FOCUS IS ON HOW EVENT HAPPENED VS CAUSE OF EVENT
- History is factual, socio is analytical
- archival research, content analysis, and comparative historical analysis to
- Historical sociology as a branch ->
    - Origin and evolution of social institution – origin of family (hoarder to patriarchal monogamous) or religion (animism and naturism) / Indology/ Orientalist
    - Generalization based on historical event - Used by **Marx**, **Durkheim**, **Weber**, Indology
- **GE Howard** – history is past socio, socio is present history
- Socio w/o history is rootless, history wo socio is fruitless
- Subaltern study – study mass from lens of masses eg women, queers
    - Devi movement – in Guj – Sanskritization of tribals at grassroot level so no land reform by mass for mass – no charismatic leader
    - Study of dasi in vedic times
    - Pagal panthi movement

## ECONOMICS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- economics focuses on the **economic aspects, such as market structures,** resource allocation, and financial systems
- Different –
    - Scope
    - methodology (quant vs qualitative)
    - not concerned with impact of MOP (or how much is being produced) – like **Marx**
    - inequality not explained
    - Narrow and laws vs deductive and nuanced
    - Can make not make theories
    - Eco considers human as rationality maximiser who is rational – called **homo economicus** whereas socio considers human as a social being who make decisions based on social norms and institutions
    - Eg – occupation due to social, religious, geo factors studied by socio and not eco (like bamboo ceiling)
    - Eg – anticipatory socialization, romantic ethics, cascading effect
    - Esp for new middle class
- **Alfred Marshall**
- **Durkheim** – DOL + socio and co have diff approach but same topic of research
- **Karl Marx** – change is social superstructure due to change in eco infra
- **Taylorism**, **Fordism**
- **Weber** – socio explains in economics what eco cant by giving a holistic view
- Related – welfare economics, impact analysis, outcome analysis, gender budgeting, tribal sub plan
- **Parsons** – eco and socio are totally inseparable from each other - > socio deals with study of eco behavior of man
- **Veblen** – socio concepts used by economists such as leisure class
- **Adam Smith** – market is non discriminatory and sacred
- Spending is driven by norms and culture of society -> eg marriage; so actual spending based on culture and not spending capacity
- Eg – leather industry for brahmins – tannering industry
- Eg – manuak scavengers as lower caste

## POL SCIENCE
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Pol science is the branch of natural science concerned with state institutions, political behavior, thoughts, governance and power
- Differences between the two
    - Traditional P focused on state and power whereas asll aspects
    - More concerned with the end result whereas focus on why such result is being achieved
    - Makes policy whereas provides base to make the policy
- Politics and socio are 2 branches of socio science which have stark overlap, but minute differences at the same time
- **Catlin** – pol science and socio 2 faces and aspects of same figure
- Political sociology
    - Social factors underlying distribution of power -> gender, caste, religion, class
    - Health of democracy and diff socio regimes – V-Dem report (variety of democracies)
    - **Weber** – bureaucracy
    - **Marx**
    - **Psephologist** - studies how people vote in elections
    - Pol science affects socio – one child
    - Socio affects pol – voting pattern, caste, community
    - **Plato** and his men of gold, silver, iron
    - **Aristotle** and citizenship
    - **Rousseau** and general will
    - **Locke** and rule of law
    - **Mills** – elite theory
    - **Pareto** – fox and lions and elite circulation
    - Critical theory – rejects between democracy and socialism as both dominate the subjects and term Naxalites
    - Hegemony

## PSYCHOLOGY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- From v advet tried to dissacoiate itself
- P focuses on human behavior at an individual level vs at a societal level
- 3 theories
    - **Durkheim** - different
    - Utilitarian phenomenology interaction – celebration of psycho
        - **JS Mill** – law of mind base of all socio -> there is no collective; every collective is product of individual
        - **McDougall** and **Freud** – whole social life reduced to psychological; factors – hence socio a psychology branch
    - Abalysis of social structure and impact of social factors vs mind and its actions
    - Sociological imagination vs individual traits
    - **Weber** – complementary as explains underlying behaviour
    - Individual vs collective behavior
    - Generalization vs unique context
    - Experimental vs empirical
- Complementary
    - Social psychology eg **Merton** reference group theory and anticipatory socio
    - Status and role ->
        - Status - position with duties and rights
        - Role - Set of expectation from that position (eg depression due to unemployment)
    - **Cooley** – looking glass self
    - **Parsons** – enriches socio – motivation oriented social actions as well as affective role of a mother
    - **Weber** – interpretivist and need to focus on understanding of social actor -> reciprocal of each other
    - **Durkheim** – celebration of socio – considered suicide not psychological but social-> suicide not psychological but social concept
    - **Marx** – alienation
    - **Merton** – self fulfilling prophecy and relative deprivation theory

## PHILOSOPHY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Socio evolved with strong philosophical orientation
- Socio raises philosophical questions
- Sociologists use philosophy to make theories and explain social change
- Develop concepts and ideas
- Natural philosophy cant be called a science because true science is social philosophy – **Locke**

## ANTHRO
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Understand past humans to analyze evolution, culture, social characteristics that make that culture
- Conflict theory and structural functionalism unique to socio
- Past vs future
- Stay vs observe
- Primitive vs post industrial societies
- Out of curiosity vs social change
- Eurocentric
- Social anthropology - > modernization of village or assimilation of tribe into mainstream culture
- **MNS** – took field study (inspired by **Malinowski**) + **William Whyte**
- **Spencer** evolutionary theory
- Diff stages of evolution eg
- Studies social structures over time
- Comparative socio same as cultural anthro
- **Kroeber** – Anthro and socio are twin sisters
- Hence – borrowing from other disciplines for a multi-disciplinary and integrated for holistic overview of social complexities

## COMMON SENSE
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Some say socio is diff from common sense; other say common sense closer to reality
- Common sense is shared knowledge
- **Weber** – routine knowledge of our everyday world and activities
- **Alfred Schutz's** phenomenological sociology, where it refers to organized and 'typified' stocks of taken-for-granted knowledge upon which activities
- Empirical, based on assumptions and presumption eg galileo and science (earth rotates around sun)
- Status quoist, social revolution
- Deeper insights vs prejudice
    - **Peter Berger** – debunking attitude to understand levels of reality in society vs what appears on surface
- Based on beliefs and culture, based on objective analysis
- Based on imagination, ignorance, prejudice
- Establish cause and effect relationship and developing theories
- Socio collected data on people life and questioned methods of society
- Local and temporal vs universal eg Somoa island women hard wired – common sense but not true for other places
- Assumptions vs evidence
- Intitutive vs objective
- Common sense – we don’t find pattern in seemingly diff things whereas common patterns in seemingly diff events (eg similarity in caste and race)
- For failure – we put blame on individual vs understand external factors causing influence (sociological imagination)
- Use examples where common sense diff than socio – eg > married men and single men, suicide (psychological), higher caste more meritorious (observational) and poor as they are not qualified, but actually closed stratification and elite rule,
- Common sense perspectives: 1. Biological – women have maternal instinct; but **Mead’s** theory in “**Sex and temperament in three primitive societies**” reveals not universal
- mad people more delinquent vs white collar crime (white collar more – **Sutherland**)
- women more emo than men whereas conclude role of family and media in shaping gender
- Related – vocabulary (eg vote bank and role model) , hypothesis , common sense challenges socio – dynamically evolving
- In renaissance, common sense died
- Death of common sense leads to scientific society
- Make your model of reality
- Help in getting qualitative data eg – capitalism
- Not understand socio research otherwise
- Develop ideal type
- Helps in understanding socio theories
- Socio questions common sense eg religion **Durkheim**
- **Locke** – sensory organ is collecting data and when it is filtered through a rational mind, people look at the data with diff perception
- **Beckers** – labelling theory of sociology becomes common sense
- **Gramsci** – cultural hegemony of elite become common sense
- Refine common sense like vote bank, anticipatory socio (act like actor)
- No gospel truths, hence multiple interpretations of society need to be accepted and common sense is an integral part to develop that unerstabding
- **CW Mills** and sociological imagination
    - SI as a tool to study social, external forces shape individual’s life
    - An ability to explain social forces governing individual life
    - He described 2 terms – personal issue (biography) and public issue (history)
        - Bio – a document on individual life
        - History – past or recent events
    - But everything is a public issue and nothing is a personal issue
    - Eg – crime and crime rate (**Merton** strain theory between culturally defined goals and socially available means), suicide and suicide rate (based on societal solidarity), divorce and divorce rate (service sector means financial indepdence for women)
    - Socio imagination study rates and not actions
    - These will depend on type of society and group membership
    - Study external force instead
    - Eg – sex ratio is skewed in Punjab and Haryana (bio); why? History -> Green rev + legalization of abortion + ultrasound tech -? led to individuals skewed sex ratio
        - Hence it is combining bio with history
    - Suicide of individual -> history of society (modern or old) ; martyr vs competitiveness and isolation in modern societies
    - **Merton** – American dream led to 1940 se increasing suicide
    - Biography may also be read to study history such as **Annie Frank**

### CRITICISM
- Post modernist – socio of today is common sense of tomorrow; not superior
- Phenomoneologist – focus on what people do

## SOCIO AS A DISCIPLINE
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Interdisciplinary approach – combine 2 disciples and integrating them
- Multi disciplinary – combine 2 or more without necessarily integrating these disciplines – eg Climate change analyzed by environmentalists, economists (how much to contribute), politicians (intl conventions), sociologists (LDC waste of developed), psychology (irrational decisions)

## SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Scientific method is a logical and systematic method with steps to conduct scientific enquiry
    - Topic selection eg domestic abuse
    - Problem definition eg why – narrowed the problem
    - Preliminary research and existing literature review
    - Develop hypothesis – untested assumption
    - Operationalize variables in hypothesis ie explain the meaning of the variable
    - Choose research method – survey interview/ observation etc
    - Data collection and check validity and reliability of data
    - Analyze, Generalization and publish – hypothesis approve or refute
- Critique of science and scientific method
    - Multicausality in social world; however restrict variables
    - Inter mixture of cause and effect -> poverty and alcoholism
    - Difficult to quantify the data
    - Difficult to establish reliability
    - **Karl Popper** – many statements and hypothesis in social science are not falsifiable and hence not scientific
        - Eg **Freud’s** 3 layers in cognition – ID, ego, superego
        - **Karl Marx** – said fully developed society like Europe will be first place to have communist revolution. This is falsifiable . but revolution is not coming because people are living in false consciousness is not falsifiable
    - **Paul Feyerbend** – in reality, many scientists are not going with scientist method, rather dream experiences, assumptions or chance experiments (**Madam Curie** chance experiment)
    - **Thomas Kuhn** – science undergoes paradigm shift where one theory is replaced by another but however in science, there is always one dominant paradigm. In social world, there is no one dominant paradigm and hence socio is not mature science but young science

## POSITIVISM AND CRITIQUE (OTHER THEORETICAL SCHOOLS)
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Positivism – cause and effect relationship that can be observed to define fixed laws of society such as in natural sciences. Philosophy which considers society exists like a natural system with inst such as family, state, law etc and has natural laws
- Features - **TOCQI**
- Assumes society exists naturally out there
- They will objectively collect data
- Finds correlation between variables and develops causal grand theories (generalization)
- It believes social world to be driven by single cause (mono causal)
- Try to predict behaviour
- Focus only on observable facts and considers other factors such as motivations ad meanings as inconsequential
- **Comte** defined positivism in 2 ways:
    - As a doctrine (a philosophy) or as a method (research methodology)
- Science – organized body of knowledge where facts are inter-connected to each other on basis of which conclusion are established
- Features of socio as a science (**TOQI**)
    - Empirical
    - Based on theory
    - Objective
    - Testable
    - Use scientific methods
    - Use deductive approach and empiricism
    - Reliability and replicability
- Then why socio is science – positivism
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 9.png>)
- Definition, Features, example
- How **Weber** concludes socio as science
    - **Weber** – socio is science as far as concerned with study of social actions, its causes and consequences objectively
        - What makes interpretive socio scientific -> qualitative data in a value-neutral manner
        - Social world by causal probabilism as there is one necessary cause eg – protestant ethics was a necessary cause
        - Every interpretivist socio accepts that they cant study the world as is; so study the model of social world (ideal type)
- Anti positivist
    - **Karl Popper** – 2 types of disciplines – pseudo science (theory is verifiable) and science (falsifiable)
        - Eg – suicide theory is verifiable but not fasifiable as solidarity makes sense but not falsifiable
    - **Thomas Kuhn** – young science and mature science; socio is a young science as multiple and single paradigm
        - Truth Is relative and based on the dominant paradigm
        - Eg – capitalism **Marx** vs **Weber**
    - Ethno and pheno – social world is illusion
    - **Horkheimer** – conservative and status quoist
    - **Peter Berger** – “sociology of everyday life” – humans are not puppets who react blindly to external stimulus but create their own reality + social facts don’t fall from the sky but develop in a particular context
    - study in many ways -> **Merton** with his mid range theories
- **Sayer** – socio may have predictions which are not always valid but it doesn’t mean its not science, it is as much science as seismology ; open science
- In concl, socio in its nascent stage was ambitious to gain a scientific status, but later started studying science sociologically
- Non positivists
    - Interpretivists -> consider social world consisting of meanings and motivations of individuals
        - Study the social action of individual (SA – any action which is meaningly and intentional in a social context)
        - Collect qualitative data, meaning and motivations
        - Eg – intention behind divorce , experience of prosperity and poverty
        - Value neutrality should be maintained
        - Data collection by verstehen
        - Multi causality – no single phenomena but understand causal probabilism (one necessary cause but other sufficient causes)
    - Phenomenology –branch of interpretivist sociology which considers social world and the knowledge about it, as a social construction ie. social world consists of subjective experiences and meanings of individuals
        - Influenced by **Weber’s** theory of attaching meanings at a micro level- where meanings don’t have independent existence but reconstucted by actor in their social interactions
        - Tries to explain what role human awareness plays in social actions. The focus is to explain the meaning of phenomena instead of how they came in to existence
        - Meanings are not fixed and hence there cant be an objective fact
        - Every meaning depends on context (called indexicality)
        - Human beings attach meaning to phenomena in not a mental action but based on some “typifications (good bad, moral immoral) and depends on culture which finally creates social reality -> no objective idea (**Alfred Shutz** in his **phenomenology of the social world**)
            - This was in contrast to **Edmund Husserl** who claimed classification of phenoema was a purely product of human mind
        - Purely qualitative data collected to understand diff objects, events, inst, object etc
        - Despite each ind having diff world view and meanings, social world/ order exists only because all of us have commonly agreed over few things
        - Eg marriage in Bihar (pakadhwa) vs church wedding in US
        - But even social order commonly agreed between members is also an illusion and not objective facts
        - Bracketing is a methodological tool used in phenomenology.
        - eg – data on crime , poverty (poverty rates diff by diff committees), exports -> opinion of investigator and not objective
        - questions even official data eg – GDP change base year
        - _P is required to explicate (explain) the concept which positivists take as granted in order to measure them (**Hussrel**)_
        - Eg – **Cicourel’s** study of juvenile justice ; police and juvenile officers had the problem of classifying the behaviour of juveniles into the categories: delinquent and non-delinquent. **Cicourel** did not find this process to be objective: it largely depended on the stereotypes of the ‘typical delinquent’ held by the official
        - Criticism – questions v existence of socio + too susbjective and common sensical
    - Extra
        - **Peter Berger** and **Thomas Luckmann** – no reality other than subjective reality of individuals
        - **Gabrielle Farina** in her “**Some reflections on the phenomological method**” – it is nether a docrine nor a philosophical school but a style of thought where investigator can have different experiences and results each time
        - Create theories
        - Enhance research methods
        - **Shutz**: positivism not considered with socio but made out of socio
    - Ethno – **Harold Garnfienkel** – study from people perspective and not investigator perspective using a documentary
        - Phenological research to explain how members create order in society
        - There are socially constructed rules of everyday interaction.
        - Members of society are repeatedly performing these rules and maintain social order (Document of Rules)
        - But the social order is an illusion
        - **Garfinkel** introduced “Breaching experiment” to prove illusion -> disrupt the social order and record the reaction of members
        - On recording the reaction of members, it is found members become desperate to restore the original social order, which shows that social order is not naturally out there but a construction of the members following the rules of everyday interaction
        - Lodger experiment – ask mom for food bill
        - Focus on what people do instead of what people think as in P
        - Critique – labelled as traditional or folk methodology
        - **Alvin Gouldner** – E focused on trivial aspects of life which everyone is aware of
    - Symbolic interactionism – **GH Mead** and **Herbert Blumer**
        - Philosophy that explains social world as a set of symbols exchanged between members
            - Humans are endowed with cognitive thought/ cognition
            - Cognitive though is developed through social interaction
            - Social interaction involves exchange of signs, symbols, gestures
            - Meanings behind everything are created and shared through language
            - Social order is possible only because of exchange of symbols and mutually agreed meaning of symbols
            - Eg – unfurling flag or burning flag
    - Dramaturgy – by **Goffman** – philosophy which explains socio world is a theatre and members are performers
        - Each member performs a role in everyday life
        - Role is performed acc to status
        - Role performance is done in front stage
        - Members prepare for role keeping expectation of audience
        - Member is ideal in back stage
        - Every member resort to role distance is to be taken seriously in some context (sometimes become informal – off script)
        - Every member is doing impression mgt
        - Eg – Delta airlines -> air hostess offers service + smile (emotional labour concept)
- Post positivism
    - Philosophy which critiques and refines positivism -> doesn’t reject
    - Quanti + quali data -> eg – unemployment rate plus experience
    - Researcher has some value as they are also humans
    - Quantitative method of research eg survey + qualitiatve method such as interview (esp unstructured)
    - Triangulation method
    - **Karl Popper** + **Thomas Kuhn**

- Example
    - Correlation -> racism leads to discrimination and poverty
    - Interpretisvist: why racism and how does It make them feel

## CRITICAL THEORY/ CONFLICT THEORY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Branch of socio that considers society not a natural state but a social construct created by the dominant group (patterns of inequality created by few dominant groups)
- will collect data to expose anomalies in society and advocate change in society
- quanti data but quali change eg **Ambedkar**
- 2 groups – Marxists and feminists
- Marxists – economy is the basic structure -> social world characterized by eco infra defines social superstructure
    - Base of eco changes due to changes in production – means and tech; few groups command ownership as tech changes and masses work for those few
- Eg – **Harvey** and his study on exploitative role of social objects
    - **Ken Plummer** – study of transsexualism -> need for equality
- **DEPENDENCY**, **SUBALTERN**, **MARXISTS**, **FEMINISTS**
- Any research done by/ for/ of women. Focus on gender inequality but also advocate change through policy formulation or activism
- Features
    - Preference to women experience about their working or domestic life
    - Pref to qualitative data like unstructured interview, case study, etc
    - Preference to building rapport with research subject eg **Ann Oakley** studied experience of women in transition to motherhood
    - Time taking process
    - Advocates intersectionality (eg Dalit women most exploited); black/ muslim/ dalit or combination of each
    - **Kimberley Crenshaw** – developed the intersectionality approach
    - Aim to create social change either by movement, policy advocacy or reforms at intl level
    - Mainstream is male stream research -> aim to de-masculinise and feminize malestream research
    - Eg – **Ann Oakley** conducted detailed study on women experience to motherhood using qualitative research method like unstructured interview
    - Eg – **Claudia Goldin**
- Features of Critical social research:
    1. Abstract concepts and ideology: Critical social research use abstract concepts such as housework, but
    goes beyond simply carrying out empirical studies based on such concepts.
    o Critical research tries to get beneath the surface of social reality. Distorted ideological beliefs may
    be related to dominant classes or to patriarchal or racist beliefs.
    o They mask the material reality that lies behind these beliefs. But critical social research involves
    trying to overcome the dominant ideology or ideologies.
    2. Totality, structure and history: Each abstract concept and particular belief cannot be examined in
    isolation. According to **Harvey** it is necessary to relate each bit of a society to a totality.
    o **Harvey** says: Totality refers to the view that social phenomena are interrelated and form a total
    whole.
    o Critical social scientists see societies as possessing structures. Structures constrain or limit what
    people can do, but also make social actions possible. Structures, though, are not static; they
    change.
    o Studies of society therefore need to be related to particular historical contexts. One needs to
    examine how particular societies have changed over time in order to understand them at any
    particular point in time.
    3. Deconstruction, essence and reconstruction: Critical social researchers proceed through a process of
    deconstruction and reconstruction.
    o In the process of deconstruction, the different elements of particular areas of social life are taken
    apart in order to try to discover an essence. The essence is the 'fundamental concept that can be
    used as the key to unlocking the deconstructive process'.
    o Reconceptualization - thinking of familiar aspects of social life in unfamiliar ways - is the key to
    discovering essences through deconstruction. This process is never finished. The process of
    deconstruction does not follow a pre-set path, as laid down by, for example, positivists.
    o Deconstruction leads to reconstruction. The researcher aims in the end to 'lay bare the essential
    relationships that are embedded in the structure'. They develop theoretical insights that allow the
    phenomena under investigation to be seen in a new way.
    4. Praxis: Critical social research is not just a theoretical activity; it is also a form of praxis.
    o **Harvey** defines praxis as 'practical reflective activity. Praxis does not include "instinctive" or
    "mindless" activity like sleeping, breathing, walking, and so on, or undertaking repetitive work
    tasks. Praxis is what changes the world."
- For Marxists, subject matter is peasants, poor, vulnerable, marginalized
- The concept of hegemony, originally developed by **Antonio Gramsci**, refers to the ideological and cultural
- dominance of the ruling class over subordinate classes. **Stuart Hall** extended **Gramsci’s** concept of hegemony to analyze the role of media in shaping
- popular consent and legitimizing the interests of the ruling class. He argued that the media
- constructs a “common sense” worldview that aligns with the dominant ideology.
- **Louis Althusser** argued that the ruling class maintains its hegemony through ideological state
- apparatuses (**ISAs**), such as schools, media, and religious institutions

## RESEARCH
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Longitudinal study – removes bias, comparative analysis, preferred by feminist as emotional bond, higher validity
    - Criticism – hawthorne study + lesser reliability + participation observation challenge like **MNS** + investigator bias
    - Helps in objserving cause effect relation (incl plurastic probability) and even make generalization and theory
    - Imp for ethnigoraphic accounts

## OBJECTIVITY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Quality of researcher to keep investigation free from bias, opinion and personal value/ prejudice, value and subjective interpretation
- Borrowed from natural sciences and Was colonized by positivists for the longest time i.e quantitative data as the symbol of good research
- However **Weber** questioned in his book “**Objectivity in social sciences**” and redefined objectivity in his work
    - Value neutrality: Collect Qualitative data in a value neutral manner
    - Vale relevance: every researcher is opinionated and hence should declare his/ her values right at onset of research (tell why)
    - Causal probabilism: multiple causes but necessary sufficient eg protestant
    - Ideal type : no absolutely objective scientific analysis of social phenomena independent of one sided view points. Every researcher has one sided understanding of social world which only explains his model of world. He should clearly state that he is only studying model of the world
- **Robert Bierstedt** – defines objectivity as conclusions derived from investigation are independent of race, caste, colour, nationality and political predisposition of investigator
- Multiple sources of subjectivity incl
    - Choice of topic and problem definition . **Weber** argues subjectivity can be tolderated at this level in his book “**MOSS**”
    - Question to be answered in research
    - Research methodology deployed by investigator
    - Interpretation of the investigation data analysis – **Oscar Lewis** and **Robert Redfield** in Tepostaton both observed Mexico – **RR** functional approach and harmony; Marxist approach and conflict
    - Subjectivity in certain research methodologies and empirical data collection itself like qualitative interviews, participant observation and non participation observation (prejudice) eg – feminists suggest supporting the interviewee
    - CHOICE OF testing tools
    - Challenges in data collection – **Andre Beteille** not allowed in Sripuram village
        - **William Whyte** – from non participant observer to participant non observer
- Has been explained by multiple thinkers incl
    - **Max Weber** in his – value free research via ideal types
    - **Durkheim** in his “**Rules of sociological method**” – consider social facts as things
- Other safegurads
    - Clearly lay down bias
    - Use spatial and temporal dimensions
    - Focus on testing and reflexivity
    - Double blind in research
    - Larger sample
    - Temporal and wider applicability research
- Difficiult to achieve objectivity as
    - **Dilthey** – a fact based approach focuses on one dimension and ignores other cultural ideological dimensions
    - Phenomenologists like **Shutz** – subject matter has consciousness and **Hussrel** – socio research can not be value free
    - **Gunnar Myrdal** - - total objectivity is an illusion which can never be achieved
    - Also, lose reformist agenda
    - **Alvin Gouldner** – Value neutrality is an elusive goal in sociology as investigators have to deal with multiple layer truth
- Hence desirable yet elusive goal with its own limitations due to the unique subject matter of socio which possesses consciousness . deploy most objective research methods for meaningful results

### CRITICISM
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 17.png>)

## THEORY AND FACTS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Traditionally, facts and theory have often been summarized as diametrically contrasting dimensions of sociology with facts focusing on observable, verifiable data whereas theories being abstract social imaginations and hypothesis
- But invalid
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 15.png>)Intertwined – facts are verified theories based on a hypothesis whereas theories guide the research methodology for data collection to emerge as facts as well as summarize the relationship between different social facts and observations in a meaningful way
- Theory helps in
    - Hypothesis formulation
    - Testing and research methodology
    - Meaningful (causal relationships amongst facts)
    - Predictive analysis as observed by social facts of **Durkheim**
    - Point gaps for further research
- Fatcs help in
    - Validating or falsifying a theory
    - Base for positivist ideology of sociology
    - Formulate grand mid range thepries
    - Multivariate analysis
    - Comparative analysis
    - Longitudinal
    - Concomitant analysis
- Hence, imperative to understand the coherent dimensions of fact and theory for holistic development of socio as a discipline and defining social relaities
- Example -> women deterioirate condition
- Theory – relation between female workforce and women deteriation
- Hence hypothesis
- However, difficult as no agreement on social facts
- Variations in interpretation of facts
- Hence, while not possible to achieve complete value neutrality, possible to be objective in research and theories
- Socio w/o va;ue is unsociological

## TYPES OF RESEARCH METHODS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Theories make hypothetical claims and data helps in supporting, disproving or modifying them
- _Definitions_
- Methodology
    - Research methodology refers to the theoretical and philosophical framework that guides the entire research process
    - the principles, concepts, approaches used to conduct research, including the overall strategy, and justification for choosing research methods
- Types of data – primary and secondary
    - Primary – data collected by the investigator eg interview
    - Secondary – data already available in some form and collected by others eg official statistics, reports
- Data analysis – organizing data in a systematic way to discover the pattern revealed
- Serendipity – accidently discover sth while other research (like a latent function -> eg Hawthorne effect – find impact of lighting but ended up finding productivity same as they knew they were being observed. unemployment at single and global level, but it manifests into reducing education spending!)
- Quanti and qualti
    - Every theory produces a claim which is either accepted or rejected
    - Eg – suicide rate and industrialization – so need a comparative method to compare suicide rates before and after
    - Overall we used 2 quanti methods 1. Official statistics and 2. Comparative method (statistics means method in socio and not data)

|quantitative research **method**|Quali|
|---|---|
|Positivist **methodology**|Interpretivist|
|Quanti data|Quali data|
|Survey, official stats|In depth interview, observation|
|Used for Generalizations in social world eg – poverty pattern, suicidebsolidarity|Used for find experiences or world view of limited number of individuals or groups in detail ; usually not generalizable|
|Benefit – pulse check (official stats), verifiable , explanatory , unemployment as a root cause of poverty|Eg – **Weber’s** idea of verstehen and ideal types<br><br>Eg – **Ann Oakley** research on Housewives<br><br>Eg **Robert Merton** reference group theory<br><br>Ef **Stouffer’s** soldier deprivation theory<br><br>Eg – **Cicourel** theory of delinquent behavior|
- Epistemological foundation of research method
    - Branch which deals with sources of knowledge - process of knowing the social world
    - 3 ways – direct observational (positivist), indirect experienced (interpretivist), critically examined (critical)
    - Socio knowledge not same as philosophical or personal belief. Since socio claims to be a scientific discipline, it relies on empirical data. Both quantu and quali data in studies are empirical in nature.
    - There are 3 major approaches to know about social world empirically – positivist, inter and critical
- Feminist and Marxist researches
- Types of quanti research method
    - Sociologists use data ie convert social world into a numerical data eg suicide rate, poverty rate, workforce participation raye eyc
    - Structured interview
    - Official statistics – stats published by govt – can be hard facts (cannot be fiddled with) or soft facts (eg crime rate- can be fiddled)
        - Phenomenologist critical as data shows more of their priotities in collection rather than the people surveyed
    - Survey ->
        - Method in which multiple individuals respond to series of questions on a questionnaire or an interview selected from a target population
        - It may take the form of a questionnaire or interview
        - looks at large-scale social patterns abd make comparable resuls
        - It can be quali or quanti
        - Features
            - Runs on Q given to sample of respondents eg – pollsters use survey to gauge public opinion
            - Manufacturers use it to understand product feedback
        - Looks at large scale social patterns
        - Can be open ended or close ended questions
        - Ques may be based on likert gutman or Bogardus scale
    - Questionnaire -> a series of written questions which a researcher presents to respondents
        - Post/ email/ hand
        - Consists of 2 kinds of ques -> Close ended or open ended (veg/non veg or why)
        - Q used by feminist researcher, Marxists, economists, psychologists to understand or collect response on inequality/ gender/ caste race
        - It can be used to find answer to v specific questions
        - Can be used as a component of a large scale social survey in an otherwise spatially dispersed sample as well
        - Used by **Karl Marx** – first time survey in 1880s composed 101 questioned survey titled “**Worker’s enquiry**” amongst more than 25k French workers to understand nature of exploitation
        - Have high reliability as standardized
        - Have high validity as qualitative data can be collected
        - Used by **Goldthorpe** in his affluent worker study
    - Lab experiment – written notes
    - Scale approach -> used to collect quanti data from a set of population (sample)
        - Likert scale – 1,2,3,4,5 eg swiggy; not so reliable
        - Guttman scale – consisting of less likely, most, most unlikely/ agre, strongly agree
        - Bogardus social distance scale - experience of living with minorities in US -> used to measure ipiion of a group about another group (how likely are yoigoing to stay with minority); can have both likerd and gutman
        ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 16.png>)Helps in quantifying qualitative questions + standardization data collection
        - Easier to analyze and draw conslusions
        - Efficiency an reducer error
        - Economical and efficient
    - Structured interview/ formal interview
        - A structured interview is a series of questions a researcher asks respondents in person.
        - Mainl closed questions
        - Asme ques in same order comparable results
        - Respondent can chose only from given options
    - Laboratory experiment/controlled experiment: experiment that takes place in a closed environment where researcher creates laboratory like condition, creates groups like experiment group and controlled group, observe the impact of independent variable on the experiment group (dependent variable).
        - **Bandura’s** bobo doll experiment was conducted to study whether violent television LEADS TO more violence in kids – ans yes; so correlation or causation
- Quali research methods
    - Work with non numerical data for understanding social world and theories like text, notes, videos
    - They describe lived experience in detail
    - Eg – experience of youth going to clg
    - Unstructured interviews
        - Eg **Arlie Hochschild** – 50 couples in a 2 career marriage and 45 otherwise to understanding how shared responsibilities in nwew reality called “the second shift”
    - Ethnography/ participant observation ->
        - PO is a subset of a Ethno -> PO is a technique of data collection whereas ethno is a research method
        - Technique where researcher immerses himself in native’s everyday life and study their culture – PO
            - Eg – **MNS** multi caste tribal groups in Rampura – had diary + language -> identified a caste of people who were dominant caste who were shudras
                - Explained how untouchables were not allowed to sanskritize
            - Limitations – gatekeepers – insiders restrict your worldview to their world view
            - not allow data collection
            - location comfort
            - language learning – diff interpretation leads to reliability and validity
            - ethics of research
            - going native phenomena – you become that person
            - hawthorne effect
            - time consuming
            - no generalization
            - lower validaity
            - partial representation of reality – value relevance
            - problem of role allocation
        - **SC Dube** also – Sharmipet - method of conducting village study
        - PO has field work; E not necessary
        - E:
            - Method which involves deep engagement with community/ village/ tribe/ group in its natural setting eg **MNS** in Sripuram
            - Involves researcher building rapport with research subjects
            - Involves researcher learning local dialect/ lingo/ dialect
            - Maintains a dairy on inhabitants to keep data in a chronological manner
            - It helps in learning the “others” and their world view – develop subaltern perspective, feminist
            - Involves months to years to complete research
            - Eg – **MNS** on Coorg, or Brahmins in Sripuram
    - FGD:
        - Involves a GD on a specific topic by the members from similar background
        - Participants are free to talk with other group members
        - Discussion is observed by researcher
        - Helps find solutions to problems to investigate group attitude and develop in depth understanding
        - Eg – new product and its features by cnsumers
        - Eg – discssion on social issue like climate change
        - From **Robert Merton**
    - Grounded theory
        - developed by two sociologists **Barney Glaser** & **Anselm Strauss**
        - qualitative data based on data collected – create theory
        - based on this, create theory and refine more using further qualitative research
        - eg – how do you cope with stress – many interviews – seek social support – what kind – best way to manage stress is informal support
        - don’t start with a preconceived notion or a theory
    - Comparative approach/ method
        - Compares variables within or across time or space
        - Typologies (**Durkheim**) ->
            - 2 diff social groups within same society eg married single/ religious athiest
            - 2 diff social groups in 2 diff time scales eg **Merton’s** study before and after 40s
            - 2 diff societies in same time scale and across time scale -> **Karl Marx** comparison of diff counties or Europe at start of modern time and later
            - Develop generalization – **Weber** protestant ethics vs religion of India
    - Biography
        - Voice of leaders or voice of mintority in main stream text
        - Study of individual life in depth to gather data and understanding about the person and historical context
        - Bios search as research method because it acts like primary source to collect data on the person in the form of photo, diary, letter, blog etc
        - It can help understand political ideology of leader through speeches and official docs
        - It can help give vice to minority groups
        - It can help to reveal intention and motivation of leaders and how they experienced any specific event
        - Eg – Diary of **Benjamin Franklin** (**Marx Weber** for study of Calvinists) and **Ann Oakley** (housewife study – own study and took their diary also – diary record of how they felt everyday for being responsible for household or childcare)
    - Historical method
        - takes a theme and traces its evolution over time through the study of books, media reports, films, and historical accounts. Such studies require extensive use of secondary data gathered over long periods of time
        - eg – **Weber** and **Marx**, caste evolution
        - data may not be precise/ available/ reliable/ accuracy
- Data analysis significance
    - Marketing and advertising
    - Political campaign
    - Analyze pop priorities eg >36 like gardening whereas 21-25 like clubs
- **Ray Pawson** – debate on this 60s hangover
- **Alan Bryman**
- Triangulation is defined as the mixing of data or methods so that diverse viewpoints or standpoints cast
- light upon a topic. The mixing of data types, known as data triangulation, is often thought to help in
- validating the claims that might arise from an initial pilot study.
- It is a valuable strategy in social sciences to enhance the credibility, reliability, and comprehensiveness of
- research findings as given below:
    - • Gain a more complete understanding: Employing a variety of research methods (qualitative,
    quantitative, and others) provides researchers with different perspectives on the same social
    phenomenon. For example, **Lenin** used a mixture of quantitative data tables along with a political economy
    analysis of charged words used in his classic research monograph, **The Development of Capitalism**
    **in Russia** (1898).
    - • Minimize Bias: Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Triangulation allows researchers
    to leverage the strengths of different methodologies and mitigate the potential biases inherent in any
    single approach.
    o For instance, in “**Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste**,” **Pierre Bourdieu**
    integrated qualitative methods with quantitative analysis to mitigate biases inherent in singular
    methods.
    - • Increased confidence in findings: Replication of results across different methods strengthens the
    reliability of findings. If various approaches consistently yield similar conclusions, it increases
    confidence that the findings are not simply an artefact of the chosen method.
    - • Richer and more nuanced understanding: Triangulation allows researchers to capture a more
    complete picture of the social phenomenon under study.

## SAMPLING
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- It is a process of collecting sample from pop for a desired research
- Random or non random sampling ->
    - Random sample
        - Simple random – a process where everyone has equal chance of getting selected as a part of sample,. Done through random number generator eg – chits in a class
        - Stratified random – process of dividing the group into strata seg gender/ age based and then conducting random sampling within each strata
        - Systematic random – select every nth element as starting point and other members are selected after a fixed sampling interval
    - Non random
        - Convenience: those who are conveniently available to researcher are taken eg – first 30 customers of store
        - Voluntary response: a sample based on the ease of respondents. R directly contact the researchers and volunteer themselves
        - Purposive: Involves researcher using his/ her judgement to select a sample which is most useful to the purpose of research. Researcher wants to gain detailed knowledge about the specific group and may exclude other groups.
        - Snowball: It is used in cases which involves inaccessible or elite strata of society. Researcher gets in touch with a group and that group introduces researcher to another group

## RESEARCH DESIGN
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Refers to a set of/ document which lays down research question, objectives, sampling method and type of research method used for data collection
- Types
    - Exploratory: involves research to understand an unexplored phenomena eg – reason for certain dropout in school , why is suicide increasing
    - Explanatory : after understanding cause, researcher expalains cause in detail. Focus is on explaining a phenomena to cause effect relationship. Comes after exploratory research and aims to go deeper into result produced during exploratory research eg – what is impact (quali)
    - Descriptive: type of research which provides description of the characteristics of a phenomena eg – how many impacted – more quanti
- Utility
    - Limit scope
    - Conduct research comprehensively in a specific direction
    - Address dd of question
    - Decide research method
    - Imparts scientific status to research
    - Cross sectional research design – findings across time and space
    - Longitudinal research design
    - All based on question being studied
    - Value neutrality and objectivity
- No research without design

## HYPOTHESIS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **GA Lundberg** - Tentative generalization whose validity yet remains to be tested
- usually links two or more social variables
- 2 – simple hypothesis, more than 2 – complex hypothesis
- eg
- acts as starting point for research eg – poverty as a factor behind crime rate
- helps in data collection,
- direction – quali or quanti (data method and research design)
- limit scope
- proving or disproving a claim
- making theory, generalization or law
- reliability and validity
- Sources
    - existing literature
    - personal experience
    - deductive theory uses hypothesis – positivists
- Variables
    - any data which is subject to change is a variable
    - can be dependent or independent variable (effect and cause respectively)
    - can be quanti (data on income, age poverty) or quali variable (data on experience)
    - operationalization of variable -> process of quantifying a seemingly immeasurable phenomena eg – health of democract based on free speech, free fair electins, representation of people -> HDI index

## PYQ
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Rupture of modernity -> collapse of functionalism and bankruptcy of Marxism
    - Functionalism fall – give the three postulates of **Merton**
    - Marxism fall – give china + **Popper** + need to focus on individual meanings
    - Rupture of modernity – fundamentalism, religious revivalism, individualism
- **HERMENEUTICS**- TEXTS
- WHO ALL IN INFORMAL – CASTE, FEMINIST, SUBALTERN, CONFLICT, CHILD, TRIBE

## KARL MARX
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- _Marx is an institution, not a person_
- **St Simon** – ethical socialism
- **Historical Materialism**: theory given by **Marx** how history evolves in dialectical manner through change in material condition
    - Book: **Preface to Contribution to Critique of Political Economy**
    - What: Evolution of society (modes of production) with changes in material factors or economic infrastructure (consisting of forces of production and relations of production – relation b/w man and man and man and things)
    - Supplemented by **dialectic materialism** where two opposing forces interact with each other and create new structures
        - Dialectics is a way of analysing society through study of inherent contradictions and negations
        - MOP – how soc s org for goods and services
    - Inspired by **Hegel’s** idea of Dialectical idealism (that society changes with new ideas – human mind is mother of everything) – I think therefore I exist
        - **Hegel** in his idealism focused on **dialectic approach** of **thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis** for change in society – ideas emerge, counter emerges and new ideas form
        - **Hegel** said society is evolving and has 3 stages – universal reflexivity (everyone has same ideas – same as mechanical solidarity of **Durkheim**); universal egoism (everyone is focused on self interest) and universal altruism (state exists)
        - **Phenomenology of mind** – book
        - Consciousness lies in ideas

|   |   |

- But found this abstract, so took **Feuerbach’s** idea of materialism (society doesn’t change only with ideas)
    - Even considered **Engel’s** 3 laws of unity/ conflict of opposition, transition from quant to qual, negation of negation
    - Two opposing forces when interact with each other lead to conflict and create a new social structure
    - Talk about the MOP and “contradiction of history will end”
- Salient features
    1. Ideas are creation of ruling class
    2. Economy is the case
    3. Human is a working being
- _Relations of production_
    - **History is a process of man’s self creation**
    - **In order to survive, man must produce**
    - **Production is the first historical act**
    - **Man is perpetually a dissatisfied animal**
    - Humans have basic needs (roti kapda makaan) but they are not readily available. So individuals enter into social relations of production
    - These relations help transform RM into finished goods using means of production (forces of production) eg – energy, tool tech etc
    - Means of production are owned by a class of people
    - Eventually, ownership justified with help of social structure created by ruling class (like religion)
    - Due to inherent contradiction in economic system, class struggle develops. Old collapses and new comes in
    - Class struggle is the motor of history
    - Relation bw have (who own means of production) and have nots (who don’t own means of production)
    - Forces of production keep changing with change in tech – instruments without which prod is not possible – consists of scientific knowledge, technological equipment and organization of collective labor
    - Source of surplus lays in the excess of what bourgeoise / capitalist pay for labor power (ie the capacity to do value things which increases the value of the product) over the value labor power adds to a commodity
    - These can be ownership (ownership remains with the bourgeoisie) or control relations (controls production process and labour)
    - These man to man relations lead to **stratification based on their position in the production process**
    - Relation is usually in the form of **antagonistic cooperation** for man-to-man
    - Have nots don’t have ownership over things required in production process other than their own labour (not even that in ancient slave society)
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 20.png>)
- Relevance today
    - Relevance is visible when we see:
    - Demand for universal basic income
    - Neolocal and migration
    - Labor code demands
    - Peasant movement
    - Rising inequality
    - Rising monopoly
    - Rising alienation – resignation
    - Demand for social security laws not in favor of capitalist
    - Demand for regularisizng work of gig workers
    - Women – regularize working condition (pending – women reservation bill in private sector)
    - Global inequality and dependency theory
    - Commodity fetishism
- Not relevant
    - Rising middle class – look up to bourgeoise
    - Creative and customized professions + not homogenous working class
    - Labor union – overthrow becomes difficult
    - NOT ALL MASS PROD – EG ROLEX
- _Modes of production – refers to way society is organized to create goods and services_
    - Consists of means and relations of production (leads to have and have nots)
        - Tools used to create goods and services
    - Relation between class who are producing goods and services
    - Each MOP collapses due to inherent contradiction/ dialectics and from the other develops the new MOP
        - **Primitive communism**: collective ownership, production, distribution. over time, new needs develop leading to a new MOP due to inherent contradiction
            - all men were equal with equal access to forces of production in a “hunter gatherer society”. Food was abundant with ltd pop leading to cooperation rather than domination. But with invention of tools, society started breaking up as some men had more food than others, leading to private ownership with a few people and dependent slaves and hence a new mode of production emerged. negation of primitive communism
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 21.png>)
        - **Ancient slave mode of production**: ownership – master, production by slave, distribution – unequal; secondary needs develop over time -> new MOP; now exploitation by masters sch as slave trade and plantation economy leads to **inherent contradictions** and ends in slave revolt
        - **Feudal mode of production**: inherent contradictions: internal (**reducing productivity, tax revenue systems**) and external (**emergence of mercantilism, enclosure movement** as well as people finding working opp in city life with rise of capitalists)
        - **Capitalism**: inherent contradiction –
            1. **profit motive** leads to **overproduction of goods**
            2. goods for profit and not to serve human needs (**commodity fetishism**)
            3. wage cuts/ machines -> will create a **reserve army** of people
            4. reduced purchasing power and over production -> **recession**
            5. with recession, small and medium enterprises may lose market share and may be bought outby big players -> **monopolization**
            6. now lower middle class will join **proletariat class (proletarianization**) and upper middle class will in bourgeoise (**monopolization**)
            7. homogenization of Working class with more technological innovation
            8. pauperization increases + depression of middle class (movement)
            9. capitalism will be overthrown
        - **Exchange value more than use value -> commodities are created**
        - Difference between subsistence wages paid to labour and overall production is surplus which goes to capitalist. Such private ownership of surplus will lead to class struggle by workers, who will start feeling alienated and will demand ownership of surplus (Negation of negation)
        - **Features – money as a medium of exchange, ownership of capital with the bourgeoise, production process controlled by the capitalist, financial decision by the capitalist, commodity fetishism – goods for sale rather than own consumption**
        - **Socialism**: Proletariat will assume ownership of the means of production and production process in response to the class conflict of capitalism. There will be no private property – “disctatorship of class”.
        - **And surplus will be discutributed Communism**: “**Contradiction of history will end**” – Proletariat will renounce ownership of production process and truly end class conflict, where everyone will be equal. No new unequal relations of production, which ends dialectical materialism. Forces of production are collectively owned
        - **In conclusion, MOP develops in response to seeds of dialectics in previous MOP**
        - **Critical**
            - Dialectics between sexes ignored eg women suffrage movement
            - Dialectics of caste ignored eg **Ambedkar**
            - Class collaboration – trade union, cooperatives, labor codes, ESOPs
- Reserve army
    - Consists of unemployed, partially employed or under employed individuals
    - Expands with conditions of recession
    - Typology
        - Floating: workers regularly displaced due to cyclical fluctuations, bankruptcy, failure of firms and tech innovations
        - Stagnant: workers whose employment is seasonal or irregular
        - Latent: workers displaced from agri due to capitalist dev -> Changes in ASS show MOP evolution as per **AR Desai**
        - Pauper: who leave reserve army and form dangerous classes of criminals, sex workers, beggars
    - Helps capitalist class as employed will not bargain, keep wages low (eg – unorganized sector) + ensure workers are readily available and don’t demand better working conditions or form a union
    - In india, IRA is found consisting of tribals, minroties, women and others like these (**Suresh Mehrotpa**)
    - Feminist theory – **Beechey**: women constitute the biggest chunk in IRA(lindor employed, under, part time employed) – glass ceiling, wall, cliff, global gender inequality report
    - Can give suggestions
    - **Claudia Goldin** – entering service sector workforce
    - **Irene Bougel** – women rep in IRA declined with expansion of service sector
    - **D Dsouza** – migration for finding work
- **Centrality to one major thing** in every mode of production
- Class polarization
    - There will be polarizarion and homogenization amongst classes, leading to a class conflict
    - Facilitated by pauperization (inequality), proletarization (petty bourgeoise will sink into proletariat and concentration and centralization will lead to rise in capital being concentrated in fewer hands
- Being vs social being
    - Being: The constant part of human nature, which is creative and tends to make things to express the creativity
    - Social being: **Human nature** is governed by his social position in the mode of production. Excessive limitation on creativity leads to alienation
    - **Man’s consciousness doesn’t decide his being, contrary, social relation determine his consciousness**
- Alienation (**economic and political manuscripts**)
    - In capitalist MOP, alienation reaches its peak as **labour is only a means to end, which is production for capitalist**. He becomes a slave in production and creativity is lost
    - Hence, he starts getting **separated, isolated and powerless and meaningless** when he confronts social institutions that they cant control and consider oppressive
    - He gets a feeling a **estrangement and disenchantment** from a group, others even oneself
    - Alienation happens in two ways: in a given MOP, it increases with time as exploitation increases + degree increases as MOP increases
    - 4 types of alienation
- Alienation of proletariat
    - Process: Process is fixed irrespective of his own individuality and he doesn’t have any control over production process. Work becomes a means to end. The extreme DOL coerces him to become a part of the work and mechanical work does not satisfy him
    - Product: cant determine the fate of what he produces. Market works to promote the interest of the capitalist and not the worker. doesn’t have control over quality or quantity of product
    - Peers: isolated and compartmentalized work with no time to interact with others. Also competes for scarce jobs
    - Self: he loses control over his own thoughts also and works out of compulsion and not choice
- End is de-alienation which will involve capitalism where forces are collectively owned + condition of work is humanized
- **It is possible for me to do one thing to do and another tomorrow**
- **It was a history of man’s increasing control over nature, at the same time it was history of increasing alienation of man**
- **Explains rising alienation and silent quitting**
- **Even alienation amongst bourgeoise as they produce what the market wants and not what they want**
- **Supported by**
    - **Weber** – iron cage theory with extreme bureaucratization
    - **CW Mills** (**White collar**): even white collared people suffer alienation. Non manual workers have to sell their skills and hence, their personalities are bought and sold like any other commodity, alienating them from their being
    - **Herbert Marcuse**: **One Dimensional man** – leisure lies in false needs created by media to picture a “happy robot” compulsively chase “false needs”
- Class and class struggle (**Communist Manifesto**)
    - **Das Kapital** – class is people with same position in production process
    - Distinguished between 2 types->
    - Class in itself: A group of people working to fulfil their economic needs; class which doesn’t have consciousness of their position and conflict. This happens because they see similar features they have others but they themselves don’t realize they are a part of the stratum – objective manifestation of class
    - Class for itself (can be true or false consciousness). A group of people who identify capitalists as opposite to them; or as an exploitative class The reality of members and their consciousness converges (stratification lines become clear). – contradiction between class consciousness and reality of situation ends
        - **Goal is emancipation of all**
        - **Change the system – end of perpetual class struggle**
        - **Have class consciousness and class solidarity**
    - Conflict starts with consciousness and increases with antagonistic cooperation
    - Factors that lead to class struggle:
        - Bust and tech innovation
        - Proletarianization
        - Industrial reserve army
        - Depression
        - Monopolization
        - leadership, common enemy, critical mass of true consciousness, Class polarization/ pauperization – the gap between bourgeoise and proletariat will increase and this will lead to the them becoming poorer in relation to the bourgeoise – increasing class consciousness, network of communication, exploitation, alienation (conflict will be highlighted by the contradiction between social production and individual ownership)
        - ALSO Homogenization of workers will lead to disappearing of differences between skiled, semi skilled and unskilled workers
        - Resource alienation
    - What prevents class for itself? Super structural ideas, media **AR Desai**
        - Institutions and ideology justify eg religion opium + theodicy of disprivelege
        - Embourgoisement and perceive bourgeoise as a reference group rather than as exploitative opposition class with inherent contradiction
    - **History repeats itself first as tragedy and then as farce (emerging class falls back into an exploitative social structure) – polarization diagram**
    - **History of existing societies is history of class struggle**
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 22.png>)
    - Revolution will not come on its own but only if mature conditions exist
    - He talked about intermediate classes also – 6 classes in class struggle in France and 8 classes in revolution and counter revolution Germany
    - **Michael Mann** – development of class consciousness in 4 phases – class identity, class opposition, class totality and emergence of alternate society
- Commodity fetishism
    - Fetish - When commodities assume super natural qualities external to the makers
    - In capitalism, commodities are endowed with qualities like status, beauty, success, identity, lifestyle
    - **Marx** believes it’s the work of the people which gives value to these commodities but in capitalism, too much focus on commodities, not on workers
    - Craftsmanship and recognition overshadowed by brand / capital
    - Dead labor (finished good) more imp than living labor
    - Jewellery, electronics (eg – apple: update to latest iphone not for features but they want to show off), automobiles (Thar) fashion and textile (eg – Zara and H&M), luxury watches (Rolex)
    - Things become more imp than man who produces them
    - Now man and product produced have diff existences
    - In capitalism, man is not entitled to the fruit of his labor; instead it has an exchange value
    - Even labor gets an exchange value which is bought and sold
    - Little power of what we produce and hence alienation
- Other imp concepts
    - Industrial reserve army – which provides lbor in excess prosperity an cheap labor in otherwise
- Women
    - **William Goode** – industrialization made women to work
    - **Marx** – women still face old torments along with economic exploitation of capitalism
    - Feminist – problems of women submerged in family
    - **Kath Ennis** – in theory, capitalism can do without family but in practice, it require such fundamental change that it is hard to imagine it ever being carried out
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 23.png>)
- Emerging knowledge based capitalism – science and patents instead of only machines – surveillance capitaltalism of **Zuboff**
- World is going towards capitalism incl china which claims to be a socialist country
- What **Marx** looked at, the 19th century Europe, is v diff from current world
- Now, capitalist interest is distributed amongst shareholders
- Moving towards a manager managed capitalism – manager is not a capitalist but a labour
- Shift from monopolistic capitalism to cooperative capitalsm
- **Raymond Aron** – industrial society can be capitalist or socialist; but industry continues to be in the centre – both are focused on prod, just that in one, state is not as controlling + in socialism, one super industrialist vs in capitalism, multiple industrialists
    - Also said in socialism, state takes a percentage of your money – so still being exploited
- Acts as heuristic theory
- Shift from colonialization to sovereignty – class struggle
- Naxalism, Russia Ukraine
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 24.png>)
- Alienation
- Division of labor
    - **Karl Marx** suggests two types of DOL – social DOL and industrial/ manufacturing DOL
        - Social DOL includes members undertaking certain activities based on skills/ tools and exchanging it with others for the commodity to maintain socio economic life
        - Manufacture alienates/ isolates the producer from the product -> profits accre to capitalist, explitation and alienation increases
        - Leads to dehumanization of humans (vs integration by D)
        - Not based on occupational specialization
        - DOL inevitable and evolves with societal evolution
        - Anomic DOL vs alienations
    - Different from **Durkheim**

### CRITICISM
- Historical materialism and MOP
    - **Popper**: reductionist theory as he reduced importance of all other factors in society to mere economic infrastructure and material factors ; over emphasized conflict and ignored social factors
    - **Simmel**: conflict has its own functions
    - **Dahrendorf**: (**class and class conflict in industrial society**)
        - More than eco, what is imp is political class
        - Differential authority is root cause of conflict, not economic infrastructure
        - There is not as much rife with antagonism as **Marx** has visualized
        - Inequalities are highly dynamic
    - Non-positivist: ignored micro aspect
    - **Louis Althussar** – state controls over citizen by kiss or kick and not the capitalist. State influences the ideology of houses
    - **Gramsci** – domination whether in capitalism or socialism is not class domination but hegemonistic domination (ie the collective domination of a few who get power and then break promises – use ideology to dominate)
    - **Frank Parkin** – “**class inequality and political order**” – classes exist even in socialist countries
- MOP
    - Not materialized even after 140 years of theory
    - Narrow empiricism
    - Capitalism seems to be getting stronger
    - Too utopian
    - No feminism angle as patriarchy was an important angle of capitalism growth
    - Communist countries failed politically
    - Workers have themselves become stronger and organized
    - **Weber** – sole focus on economic determinism inadequate
    - **Anthony Giddens** – criticizes for neglecting individual action in social change
    - Other basis of stratification
    - **Lenski**: other MOP may emerge after breakdown of capitalism
    - **Dahrendorf**: heterogeneous workers who are difficult to be united; revolution is an impossibility as middle class will emerge and we move towards a modern society
    - **Weber**: classes are not communities who will unite; revolution is a distant possibility
    - **Ken Roberts**: limited evidence of a social class developing in manual workers (**Class in contemporary Britain**)
    - **Raymond Williams** – cultural history ad ideologies/ discourses define and shape historical development
    - **Bourdieu** – capital
    - **S Firestone**: no focus on dialectics of women, dialectics of caste (**Ambedkar**)
- Alienation
    - Very generic which club all occupations, which may not be necessarily true eg cricket
    - **Popper**: breeding ground for innovation
    - **Durkheim**: anomie and alienation can be corrected by correcting existing structure and doesn’t need an overhaul
    - **Goldthorpe** and **Lockwood**: a means to end which is std of living and not prod for capitalist (affluent worker)
    - **Robert Blauner**: alienation depends on the diff technologies and work the worker does (**Alienation and freedom**) – they go on a recreational tour to end alienation
    - **Bertell Ollman** – v difficult to distinguish between alienation and job dissatisfaction
    - **Braverman** and **John Scott** – Managerial evolution where managers are involved between bourgeoise and proletariat
    - Contemporary y jobs such as gig economy/ wfh
- Positive influence over **Gramsci**, **Adorno**, **Habermus**
- Economic determinist (too much focus on economics), but fail to see he also said superstructure helps in functioning of eco
- Can explain India’s naxalism + world system theory of **Wallerstein**

## WEBER (FATHER OF MODERN SOCIO)
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Sociology is a science which attempts at **interpretive understanding of social actions** to arrive at explanation of cause and effect
- Bridged gap between positivism (use of scientific methods) and idealism (**Kant**)
- Social action
    - First developed in “**Economy and society**”
    - An action with a meaning attached by actor, oriented towards others and taking into account the behavior of others
        - Meaning attached: actor is conscious of his actions and has some motivation to take it. Values don’t have an independent impact on the actor but are interpreted by the actor to undertake action
        - Oriented towards others, which may be physically or mentally present.
    - Understand cause and effect – basis of sociology
    - 4 types of **Ideal types of social action**
        - Rationality -> orientation to reality which weighs means and ends for purpose of efficacy
        - Affective – meaning is generated due to emotional response dedicated by the mind of the actor
        - Traditional – meaning due to cultural beliefs and traditions -> reacts automatically to habitual stimuli which guides in course of repetition or belief
        - Zweck rational – action with logical means to achieve logical end -> by well calculated logic and plan
        - Wert rational – value oriented rational actions - driven by value of society
        - eg – why actor (SRK/ Kapoor family/ bring social change/ earn a lot)
        - No action is a pure action. In reality, every action is muddled. So ideal type can help understand theoretical pure types not found in reality
- **Weber** rejected methods of natural science and developed his own methods in “**Methodologies for Social Science**”
- Verstehen (to interpret) – translate to human understanding (**MOSS**)
    - First by **Dilthey** but interpretivism by **Weber** and **Simmel**
    - Foundation of most of **Weber’s** work and one of his key contributions
    - Human understanding which involves comprehending at the level of actor by following systematic simple steps
    - Investigator should reconstruct the actor’s situational choices and constraints
    - He should be at the same wavelength with the actor
    - He should have no sympathy to actor or situation; maintain objectivity in his investigation
    - He should interact with actor to get primary sources of data
    - This can maximise the probability to understand true meaning behind an social actions
    - Meaning can be drawn via two observations (Eco and soc): direct observation (where meaning is clearly visible and understand by physical characteristics of the act and the external world eg shouting) or explanatory observation (investigator draws meaning by explaining the situation and constraint – puts the act in a context and assigns a motive to it) eg – wood to sell or fire
    - Based on the idea that meaning precedes social act. **Weber** study of “**meaningful conduct**”
- Causal Pluralist method – rejected the mono-causal theory for social actions, and said there are multiple causes leading to a social action. Focus should be on identifying the probable causes (Probabilistic theory) to understand meaning of social actions.
- Ideal types: 2nd most important contribution by **Weber**, which involves developing abstractions to understand complexity of social world by focusing on certain traits of an item
    - one sided **mental category** which highlights features deemed essential by researcher
    - **It is not a description of reality in itself but a way to express reality – it is not a pure type**
    - **Lachman**: Act as measuring rod to understand actual phenomenon. These are heuristic devices
    - **Weber** agrees there are regularities in societies, but these regularities are in the mind of the actor. The actor has subjective interpretation of these regularities
    - Used for comparison, building hypothesis and **limited generalization**
    - Ideal type tries to understand meanings in term of **regularities** and differences
    - Helps in giving objectivity to research
    - **Ideal types are formed by a number of elements, which may or may not be directly observable and hence are identified by subjective understanding of the investigator**
        - They are neither description nor hypothesis of reality but can help in description or explanation
        - Often used to general phenomena that occur at diff times and places
        - Aim – look at society objectively without bias – nth to do with values
    - Ideal types can be used in 3 categories: Historical particular, Abstract phenomena (such as social action or authority), particular behaviour (such as economic/ pol behaviour of supply demand )
    - benefits
        - Gives a ready framework for investigators to understand meanings
        - saves time
        - helps in forecasting
        - establish linkages amongst distinct social phenomenas (such as Protestant ethics and capitalism)
    - Used in **Economic and social organization, city and sociology of religion**
    - **Susan Jones** – helped socio become a separate discipline
    - Criticism -> difficult to understand the true meaning without context + bias of investigator
        - Ignored latent meaning
    - Examples of ideal type today
        - Capitalism – std, free market, profit motive – but in reality, sate intervention
        - Democracy – equality, representation, no unfair practices (diff types across world)
        - Family – middle class happy family (cereal family) – actual neolocal , diff features in diff families
- Authority – essay 1922
    - Power is an aspect of social relationships
    - Power is chane to influence others even against their will/ resistance and regardless of the basis on which opportunity rests
    - He elaborate his study in context of power in history of society what called “**Herschaf** – authority”
    - **Chance or probability** of command being obeyed by **group of people** is authority
    - Power has an element of coercion also, where authority is a form of legitimate power
    - Elements of authority
        - Master/ ruler or a group of masters/ rulers
        - Ind/ group that is ruled
        - Will of ruler is expressed through commands
        - Evidence of influence of rulers in compliance
        - Direct/ indirect evidence that rulers commands need to be obeyed
    - Patterns of authority have changed over time. 3 types of authority –
        - Traditional: authority **obeyed due to belief in traditions**, customs and values.
            - To make traditional authority more palatable, he made 3 ideal types within the ideal type
            - Gerontocracy – rule of elderly eg gram panchayat (no staff)
            - Patriarchalism eg fater, father in law, maternal uncle (no staff)
            - Patrimonialism : elderly men with proper staff for administration (eg -Parliament)
        - Charismatic:
            - Authority obeyed due to belief in charisma of a person
            - Eg – religious, political, business (eg – steve jobs), edu (Divyakranti)
            - Defines as a certain quality of an individual by virtue of which he is considered **extraordinary** and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman or atleast specifically **exceptional** powers or qualities
            - from personal traits of the leader. The person ceases to be leader if followers doesn’t find him charismatic. This can lead to revolution and is more prominent during a crisis. Hence, its usually short lived during the time of crisis - “devotion to exceptional sanctity, heroism, or exemplary character of an individual person and of order revealed or ordained by him
        - Legal rational: authority obeyed due to belief in legal rules and legislation.
    - Component used
        - Ideal type
        - Social action (affective is charismatic)
        - Power and authority
        - Causal pluralism – eg social action are not unique – necessary and sufficient causes
        - Elective affinity : connection drawn between 2 ideal types eg-> traditional SA and traditional authority; protestant ethics and capitalism
    - eg – college (dean), school (princi), office (director), sports club (coach)
    - in reality, no authority is pure type. They are all approximate types
    - people may obey authority due to multiple reasons. However, task of interpretive socio is to understand the change in patterns of command - obedience
- Rationalization
    - Change in the way people are thinking from traditional to rational ways
    - This historical evolution visible in changing form of social action and changing form of authority
    - So social action goes from affective to traditional to wert rational to zweck ration
    - Authority from traditional to charismatic to legal rational authority
    - Processes/ events which shaped -> scientific revolution, enlightenment, French revolution (common people) -> no of votes
    - Industrial revolution -> standardization and meritocracy – everything is well established and standardized
    - Example: number of marks is the focus, short notes for efficiency, well standardized criteria (1-12, then Ug), std currciculum
    - Example – food industry: more food items at less cost, food in min time(efficiency in cons), standardized protocol
    - Example – media – 1 min 100 news, Inshorts – cons of news efficiently, standard template for news
    - one authority may change into another such as routinization of charisma or traditionalization of rationality
    - Features of revolution
        - Efficiency
        - Calculability
        - Standardization – well patterned
        - Human will be considered as cases
- Bureaucracy
    - Analyzed through his approach of ideal type
    - Secondary group which is organized to complete tasks efficiently (sec means impersonal)
    - **Weber** def of bureaucracy – “hierarchical org designed to coordinate work of many individuals in the pursuit of large scale administrative tasks and org goals most commonly used in modern society
    - bureaucracy is the most rational form of legal rational authority (**Water**)
        - Hierarchical in nature
        - Impersonal
        - Rules based
        - No scope for improvisation
        - Position Cannot be appropriated
        - Staff is trained according to the requirement
        - Efficiency of highest degree
        - Different from bureaucrats, who are just positions in the bureaucracy social structure
        - Each admin official Specialized DOL and responsibility in their area of expertise
        - recruitment on merit
        - benefit of predictability and efficiency
    - found in both public and private sector for efficient completion of tasks
    - Modernization creates **hedonists without hearts and specialists without spirits**
    - While it is an appropriation of reality (ideal typical representation not completely capture the living reality) , modern societies are moving towards this type of bureaucracy
    - However, it may lead to “iron cage of rationality”, where rationality becomes so dominant that individual creativity of the person is restricted, leading to alientation
        - Can lead to dictatorship
        - It is rule bound and no space for human values
        - Cannot supersede chain of command and personally doesn’t have any power
        - Will lead to dehumanization and rationalization
    - Counter: may industries which run on creative ideas and don’t have strict rules (**Blau** study – also marketing industry, coding, music, ABP by NITI ayog, role of thics in governance, mission karamyogi)
    - **Robert Michels** (**Political parties**) – iron law of oligarchy -> will aim to preserve their power and org becomes a goal in itself. So become conservative
        - Demo seems inconceivable w/o organization but in reality, org is the death knell of democracy
    - Other concerns – disenchantment, dictatorship of officials, red tapism (ritualism)
        - Power gets concentrated in hands of a few minority to get task competed
    - **George Ritzer** – mcdonaldization to explain increasing mechanization
    - Criticism
        - **Blau** – rules don’t maximise efficiency. Instead informal settings exist within formal bureaucracy that can max efficiency due to red tapism
        - **Goldner** – bureaucratization depdenent on type of work.. predictable job -> bureaucratic org; unpredictable -> absence of hierarchy
        - **Henry Mintzberg**
            - Diff types of bureaucracy – simple (in shopkeeper), machine, divisional (global level – regions eg MCd), professional (schools, clg, music club), adhrocracy (temp form like movie – also **Avin Toffler**)
        - **Burns** and **Stalker** – said also organic bureaucracy which is bottom up not top down
        - Has inefficiency and red tapism
- Rationalization of bureaucracy
    - Bureaucracy evolved due to European climate
    - Define intellectual forces in Europe and impact like rationality and effieicny
    - As a result bureaucracy evolved over time

    - Shift from patrimonial to industrial bureaucracy shows historical experience of Europe
    - Monarchs had patriarchal bureaucracy whereas they have legal rational now
    - B is now concerned with max goods in min time
- Protestant ethics and capitalism
    - Not directly challenge marxist belief that eco infra to social superstructure. Instead believed ideas become an effective force in history and can also shape eco regime
    - 19th century Europe saw a rise of capitalism and protestant ethics around the same time; “Is there a correlation between the two”
    - state of mind concerning making ways of making wealth . this state has been historically present across societies across ancient times
        - defined 4 types of capitalism -> rationalism of capitalism
            - booty cap - war
            - traditional – silk route merchants
            - pariah - Jews
            - rational – logical calculated means of making wealth
    - Created ideal types of both (**OPAN**) and (**WIPE**) -> led to elective affinity
        - **OPAN**:
            - O – created the world for his own glory
            - There exists an absolute transcedant god who created the world
            - Predestination - Predestined each to salvation or damnation -> led to anxiety
            - Asceticism – don’t consume money – deny worldly pleasure
            - Notion of calling – all work is sacred and should be done with devotion
        - **WIPE** – capitalism
            - Capital – as reinvested
            - Efficient worker
            - Wealth accumulation is the ultimate motive of capitalism
            - Individualism is more imp for hardwork and dedication
            - Profit accumulation by rational org of work
            - Ethics of work with time is money and work is worship
    - Realized that the uncertainty of salvation made people believe success/ wealth is source of being chosen by God in afterlife. So they started working hard (leading to rise of capitalism)
    - Parallel rise of charismatic leaders also helped in development
    - Dual variables exist for rise of capitalism – spirit and substance
    - Helped by substance – tech and skills
    - Elective affinity of protestants that it led to rise of capitalism
    - “**Religion of China**” – Confucius ethics believed in collectivism/ harmony and not individualism, which is not in line with spirit of capitalism
    - Religion of india - Similarly for Hindus, caste barriers in form of Karma and that worldly activity is not important for afterlife – no spirirt
    - Ancient Judaism – no substance
    - Observing dedication towards work makes God happy
    - **Gunnar Myrdal** – similar lines – Indian archaic inst that hindered growth of economic society
    - Diff from Marxist capitalism
        - Not based on exploitation but religious beliefs and uncertainty of salvation
        - Not alienation but motivation
        - Modern cap applies rational means to profit for a rational end

### CRITICISM
- **CW Mills**: Spent limited focus on mental processes
- **Merton**: no focus on latent functions ( No focus on unintended consequences)
- No focus of societal factors
- No focus on collective action
- High level of subjectivity possible with investigator as no standard framework for formulating ideal types
- Ideal types
    - Focus on extremes
    - High subjectivity of investigator on what traits
    - No proper methodology to develop ideal types
    - Difficult to understand the relation between phenomena
- Protestant
    - **Kautsky** – capitalism preceded and protestants and developed only to justify their position
    - Took certain elements of religion and ignored others
    - Asceticism in other periods also – then why 19 century only
    - Why catholic Christians didn’t rise?
    - **Tawney** – overlooked influence of other factors like political/ legal/ institutional factors
    - **Immanuel Wallerstein** – Eurocentric
    - **Milton Singer** – took selective elements in Chettiars of Madras which had both spirirt and substance
    - **Stone**: Not protestants but bureucrats that led to capitalism
    - **Veena Das** – took too myopic a view of Indian society

## TALCOTT PARSONS
**VALUE CONSENSUS IN SOC MAINTAINED BY AGIL FRAMEWORK AND A PRE-REQUISITE FOR SURVIVAL OF SOCIETY**
**Neo structural functionalist**
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Parsons** analyzed and criticized the existing schools of thought as follows
    - Utilitarians – studied the social world in a highly individualistic fashion ; however they focus on individual choice and miss the collective
    - Positivists believed that laws of society can be observed as natural scines using empiricism and generalization ; they overlook the role of values and norms
    - Idealists – believed ideas/ consciousness is the basis of all social reality; they focus on values but miss out of external pressures of society
- Father of structural functionalism, esp in America with his grand functional theories, while considering micro aspect of social action
- He saw society as a social system comprising of sub systems with actors having unique functional pre-requisites
- Society evolves from easy to complex forms
- He rejected **Hobbes** view that man functions out of fear – instead he believed value consensus is the integrating force of society and motivates man to undertake roles
- Motive of socio is to understand how this value consensus is reached
- Social action (**Structure of social action**)
    - An act done consciously is social action. 4 elements
        - Act in a social situation
        - Orientation towards attainment of a goal
        - Regulated by norms and values
        - Investment of energy
    - The orientation may be motivational (**cognitive** – see envt in relation to their need, **cathectic** – based on emotional attitude of the actor towards object, **evaluative** – evaluate the optimum efficiency) taking into account needs and plans or value orientation (**appreciative** – judge emotional response, **cognition** – judge validity of judgement, **moral** – what is the right thing to do)
        - Motivational arise due to personal condition of actor
        - Value orientation rises due to value and norms of society
    - Three types of social action:
        - Instrumental (similar to Zweck rational social Action) – where evaluative motivation is dominating
        - Expressive – appreciative value component
        - Moral – value orientation is dominant – you are working according to societal norms
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 30.png>)
    - Ideal type of classification of social action, modes of orientation and social system is pattern variable
    - **Parsons** categorically classified human actions and society to expressive orientation and instrumental orientation
    - Expressive orientation had emotional expression, personal relationships vs instrumental orientation involves prioritize individualism, achievement of goals and rules and fulfilment of responsibilities
    - 6 types of dichotomies possible **ADAPCO**
        - Affective vs affective neutrality – A is quality of expressing one’s emotions eg – at home or romantic relationship, need affectivity whereas no expressive emotion in workplace
        - Diffuseness vs specificity – D is a quality of multiple roles played by a single individual vs well defined roles by specialized individuals eg mother plays a diffused role whereas a teacher when only be a teacher in school
        - Ascription vs achievement
        - Particularism vs universality – P is giving preferential treatment to individuals on basis of expressive ties. Vs U is equal treatment to everyone irrespective of personal ties-> special privilege to a friend (individual as unique vs same – impartial and fair)
        - Collectivity vs self orientation : see himself as apart of bigger whole vs independent
        - Eg – In India no tradition to modernization but modernization of tradition eg – caste based political party, secularism of India
        - It is the affinity between mode or orientation and subsystem that define social order of society
        - Helps in
            - Understanding modern institutions eg education schools with achievement based and universal
            - Understand conflict between traditional and modern orientation eg caste based reservation and caste based meritocracy
            - Understand changing roles in family eg in family traditional roles like mother expressive, as feminization - > mother enters workforce – nuclear families
            - But Eurocentric based on binary – Asian as modernization of traditional insittuions
    - **Tonnies** also follows similar type of social system
- Action system and Social system (**Structure of social action** and **The Social system**)
    - Action systems don’t exist in real world but are tools to analyze the real world
    - Social actions don’t happen in isolation but in constellations of social actions of individuals known as action systems. 4 Types of action systems
        - Culture system – consisting of beliefs, norms and values; “storehouse of information”; Inspired by **Malinowski**
        - Social system – actual interaction of various units in society. Institutionalized roles create social system
        - Personality system – internal and hidden aspect of society driven by motivations such as love, anger, tension sress alone; inspired by **Mead**
        - Organismic system : biological/ physical aspect of society; called the storehouse of energy
    - These are not real world but tools for analysing the real world
    - Institutionalized social structure called social system
    - Wanted to study how the norms and values of a system are transmitted to actors within the system
    - Conditions for conception of a social system
        - There should be a social interaction between 2 or more individuals
        - For achievement of some collective goal
        - There is a consensus on role expectation
        - They develop an abstract boundary around them
    - While each system maintains its boundaries and are distinct, Social system is linked to other system and influence each other through **knowledge flow and energy flow, which is called cybernetic hierarchy of control**
        - CHC is achieved by socialization and social control
        - Socialization is the transmission of valyes from one gen t another via school or fam
        - Social controls discourage deviance and various inst enforcing it are law/ police etc
    - Social system consists of plurality of individual actors interacting with each other, in a situation which has an environment with actors who are motivated in terms a tendency to optimization of gratification
    - Hence social system has a structure (units/ family/ kinship etc) and functions (performance leads to gratification and attainment of common goals)
    - Functions/ characteristics of a social system include:
        - Social system should have a structure
        - Should be supported by other system
        - Should meet significant need of its members
        - Should have a language
        - Should have a system to affress any disruptive behaviour
    - Developed structural functional theory in phases
        - Social equilibrium is the state of balance both internally amongst social phenomena and to external environment
        - Requisites functional phase (**Social structure**): Functions of **AGIL** framework need to be fulfilled for survival of any society/ structure
            - Adaptation (economic system): need for survival production of goods and services by controlling resources in envt. eg – father earning
                - Fulfilled by organismic system
            - Goal attainment: political system performs this function to define, energize, motivate, mobilise actors to achieve a common goal – determine the goal and achieve the goal
            - Integration: by social institution to maintain harmony and resolve conflict– coherence, solidarity and coordination in system
            - Latency: needs fulfilled by by cultural systems – need for socialization and cultural learnings eg- family, religion, school
        - However, certain factors cause strain in the system.
            - Eg – demographic issues eg – pop, migration, skewed sex ration
            - Tech issues – any tech like AI which can displace employees/ cause unemployment
            - New ideas like French revolution and enlighten, swaraj , Buddhism
            - Physical envt – CC, droughts
        - When soc experiences factors causing strain, society develops re-equilibriumating tendency. It means society evolves in a manner that it can deal effectively with a strain
        - In this process of adaptation, structural differentiation takes place
        - Eg – AI -> law update, edu update
        - Structural adaptation – organs of society re-align themselves to address issues at home
        - Structural differentiation – process of breakdown of roles of an institution and dev of specialized inst to deal with specific role eg -live ins and dating apps, banks, P2P lending, grants, surrogacy/ IVR, counselling
    - Mechanism equilibrium phase (**SOSA**): When specific mechanisms exist, and satisfy needs, there is an equilibrium. If there is a disruption, feedback is passed back to mechanism for a new equilibrium (this is what he called the moving equilibrium); eg - cybercrime
        - “feedback” from the action system to another. Eventually, these new inst will work towards maintaining eq (cybernetic web of control) – hence moving eq.
        - Tendency to restore eq in case disturbed because of any change in a social element
    - Status quoist – no explanation of dictator, rising inequality (Marxists)
    - **Parsons** believed after adaptation and diff, generalization of values is the automated process
    - Eg – edu changes -> we understand its part of system
- change is restorative to bring back equilibrium
- Supremacy of structure over individual in society
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 31.png>)
- Society can be explained in the form of a structure with diff status (status means structural position in social system) and individuals perform roles in each position
- Neglected the role of power or war

### CRITICISM
- Marxists: no focus on conflict theory
- **Mills**: too complex and ignores the role conflict/ inequality of power and authority
- **Merton**: Too abstract and grand – futile and sterile
- Low empirical testability
- **Dahrendorf**: too utopian
- **Jonathan Turner** – suffers from teleology and tautology
- **Dorothy Smith** – ignores gender in social change
- **Coser** – stats quoist and uni-linear
- But imp to understand social problems like poverty (Adaptation) insurgency and communalism (goal attainment), corruption (integration) and society breakdown from **AGIL** framework
- Imp from functional perspective
- Tech innovation + rising pop + failure of eco to adopt – unemployment
- A: India adapting to A – green economy + 3.5 tn
- G: Politics – digital india mission – vision 2070 – vision
- I – laws – green tribunal, DRT, DPDP
- Edu – dink fams, nuclear fams, study envt – transfer information – pattern maintenance
- Limitations
    1. No conflict – doesn’t consider sui – generis protest or social movements in society. envt movements – too consesnusal and value consensus –
    2. Group over resource
    3. who is designing goal – that isnot being studied – ignore feminist point of view
    4. doesn’t explain inequality

## MERTON (NEO-FUNCTIONALIST)
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Gave more practical theories vs functionalists (which are unworkable) and micro theoris (which have limited consequences)
- Disagreement to 3 postulates by structural theorists like **Radcliffe** and **Malinowski**
    - Universal Functionalism :
        - Social reality needs to be seen in terms of a system
        - Structural functionalists believed that **different objects or phenomena** perform function of unity of system
        - But **Merton** believed not all objects or social groups are functional and some may be dysfunctional/ non-functional, which do not contribute to unity of the system
        - **Brown**, **Spencer**, **Durkheim**
        - Eg – nuclear weapons
        - Hence, look at macro and meso level – both societal and group level
    - Functional indispensability:
        - **Brown** and **Parsons**: Some functions are bound to performed by society and **social institutions/ social items** are indispensable for performing these functions
        - Eg – **Parsons AGIL** framework
        - **Merton**: functional alternatives exist and no institution is indispensable
        - They infact lead to social change
        - Eg – creches
        - Eg – caste discrimation is not indispensable
    - Functional unity
        - Social items are not always working for society as a whole but also for some social groups
        - Social and cultural forms / social items are functionable and create positive function for the society
        - **Merton**: need to be studied in the context of the social item
        - Eg – medicinal marijuana or abortion
- Contribution of **Merton**
    - Need to look at net balance study of functionalism – function and dysfunction at both macro and meso levels of society
    - Added levels of society
    - Considered functional as status quoist
- **Merton’s** PoV: These functional theories are non-empirical and abstract. Empirical analysis is critical for functional analysis
- Also suggested a functional paradigm, a systematic approach, to conduct the functional analysis as he believed current functional theories were based on abstract non empirical works.
    - This was an integration of theirie with empirical data and research
    - Social item should be in a standardized pattern (not too abstract or too concrete)
    - Social context needs to be defined
    - General description of social item
    - Primary and secondary data should be used
    - Manifest functions identified
    - Latent functions identified
    - Dysfunctions identified
- Middle range theory
    - Acc to **Merton**, **Parsons** theory of functional structure was too abstract and didn’t encompass all system of concept. It just provided some general orientation as to what variables should be considered in research . hence it was premature and sterile
    - “**Parsons** is trying to be **Einstein** of socio while socio has not even have a **Kepler**”
    - Bridge between raw empiricism and grand theories
    - Characteristics
        - Limited assumptions or generalizations which can be verified
        - Use concepts which can operationalize the gap between theory and empiricism
    - Specific hypothesis followed by empirical evidence to make it concrete instead of grand theories or too specific micro theories
    - The theories will become more reliable, valid, and rightly organized
    - Triple alliance theory of theory, data, method
    - Benefit: empiricism, credibility, testability, reproducibility, reduce time, reduce cost, targeted
    - Disadvantage: Not specific on what constitutes middle?
        - Limited scope of framing universal theories
        - Subjectivity
        - Fragmentation of knowledge because limited social reality and only after extensive research totality
        - **Raymond Bound** – nth but what science uses in theory building
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 32.png>)
- Latent and Manifest functions
    - **Social Theory and Social Structure**
    - Earlier functionalists looked at only manifest functions, whereas his theory combined psychological and socio-cultural functions
    - One is an actual intention of the actor (manifest function – intended, recognized, expected) while other is the unintended function from the action of the actor
        - Unintended has Latent function, latent dysfunction, no function
    - Manifest function is analysed by micro theories, usually non-positivist
        - **Parsons** motivational approach/ inspired by **Weber**
        - Psychological dimension of sociological reality
    - Latent functions often include dysfunctional or unanticipated functions. The actor is unaware and has impact on social structure. This may need both qualitative and quantitative analysis eg. Class and salve domination, dowry, social media isolation, GAI
    - Hopi tribes and rain dance illustration (rain but actually integration )
    - Dysfunctional items may have positive latent functions and negative manifest functions and vice versa
    - Significance: combined positivist non positivist angles; increased scope of socio
    - **Veblen** – used example of conspicuous spending on cars (travel and status)
    - Differentiated between unintended consequences and latent functions, where LF are one type of unintended consequences (which also have latent dysfunction and no function or dysfunction of an action)
    - Partial view of realiy
    - Eg – work from home, reproduction, education,
    - Critique
        - Critics said that when he talked about functional alternative, he really was talking about structural alternatives. Semantic criticism.
        - Critics said that his model failed to predict dysfunction causing circumstances.
        - A status quoist as with latent functions he had effectively legitimised everything.
        - Overemphasis on latent functions, may compromise manifest functions eg one child policy to control national reproduction
        - Difficult to identify latent functions eg – purchasing contributes to GDP, helps in capitalism – leads to alienation
    - PYQ-> unintended consequence vs latent function – eg edu, climate, social media
    - Eg – exam, select student, creates celebs, suicide rates go up, unemployment, rote learners
    - **Colin Campbell** – it is difficult to have clear cut differentiation between latent and manifest; function and dysfunction
- Conformity and Deviance
    - **Social Structure and Anomie**
    - Conformity: action with Orientation to social norms and expectations, and within tolerance prescription of society
    - Deviation: action non-conformity with prescribed norms; reasons for deviation
        - Subculture
        - Parent deprivation
        - Faulty association
        - Differential opportunities
    - Deviance is a result for anomie
    - Deviation can be positive and rewards (Nobel) or negative and punished (such as crime)
    - Anomie: Discrepancy between culturally defined goals and structurally available means to achieve them
    - Gave the **structural strain theory** – individuals feel strain to achieve goals when they don’t have legitimate means to achieve them, which forces them to find alternatives and adopt deviant behaviour- lower class feels the strain more
    - Eg – **American dream** to work in high end jobs needs education (structural means), which may not be available to all; leads to increased crimes from unemployment – feasibility of jounrye from log cabin to white house
    - Developed in backdrop of great economic depression
    - Different types of social actors based on their **adaptive responses**
        - Conformist: accepts the cultural goals and the means available to achieve them, irrespective of their utility or fairness (majority pop such as edu)
        - Innovator: accepts goal but not the means (scientists or thieves, smuggler)
        - Ritualist: accepts means but least concerned about the goal (red tapism, employees)
        - Rebellion: nether accepts goal nor means, but creates alternate means and goals eg social reformers – proponent of counter culture
        - Retreatist: doesn’t accept CULTURAL goals or legitimate means eg alcoholist
    - What may be conformist at one time may be deviant for another time.
    - Every conformist may be deviant at some time and vice versa
    - Many cultures diverge from each other while defining conformity such as LGBTQ
    - Even relevant for understanding traffic issues in India – need to reach on time so take illegitimate means – also confirmed by **Giddens**
    - **Goffman** – we all are socially deviant
    - Criticism theory
        - **Howard Becker** (**Labelling theory reconsidered**): labelling theory said a person is deviant labelled, not for another group but + he is not deviant, he is labelled deviant
        - **Taylor** and **Lemert**: People with power define deviance and not cultural norms; they mark them as deviant
        - **Albert Cohen** – may be developed due to a subculture and not just one individual + didn’t take non-utalitarian crimes into account like vandalism
        - Country can be deviant eg – Pakistan
        - Other reasons than means and goals
        - **Walter Mills** – in lower class communication, delinquency is a learned cult and not anomic reaction to an unattainable goal
    - Hence, understanding anomies and deviances can help develop strategies to address them and prevent deviant behaviour
    ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 33.png>)
- Difference between anomie of **Merton** and **Durkheim**
    - Both analyzede anomie as a state of normlessness but offered diversified views and perspectives to understand the same

- Reference group - **STSS**
    - Contribution to the theory of reference group behaviour
    - A group against which an individual makes comparisons, to evaluate one achievements, aspirations roles etc.
    - Leads to a feeling of relative deprivation
    - Shapes our behaviors, aspirations and perceptions
    - There is an objective criterion i.e. frequency of interaction. The group refers to people who interact reagularly with each other eg – nation not a reference group
    - Used by **Stouffer’s American Soldier** which highlights relative deprivation of American soldier without any actual deprivation
        - Married with unmzarried
        - Married with civilians
        - Abroad with at home
    - Can be positive/ negative – which you want to join or avoid
        - Can be membership/ non-membership
    - Anticipatory socialization – to ease integration with reference group by behaving in the way reference group behaves
        - Aids in him rising up to the group
        - eases in his adjustment to the group
    - Marginal man – who behaves like reference group but is not merged, making him a pariah in his current group
    - Reference group can be based on status, open/ close, achievements etc
    - RG usually has a mode of com from which info about norms etc are gained. Those in authority have substantial knowledge, but authority should exceed the limit – functionally optimum degree of visibility
    - RG can also be a reference individual and not just a group – tr to approximate the role of qualities of the person
    - Can have changing reference groups as interest changes
    - Explains generation gap – diff groups chosen by diff generations
    - Self fulfilling prophecy - prediction that becomes true due the fact that it was a prophecy and re-enforced behavior
    - Used by **Srinivas** for Sanskritization
    - Eg – get in shape looks up to athlete, student who aims to excel looks at class topper
- Contemporary relevance dimensions
    - Conspicuous spending
    - Influence of celebrities and influencers
    - Social comparison
    - Emergence of low end luxury brands
    - Adaptability and migration
    - As a status symbol (eg a graduation cape)
    - acceptance to reference group (eg – tattoo)
    - et insights into the intricate relation between x and y

### CRITICISM
- Added a psychological approach to socio from biological

## GEORGE MEAD
**ROLE TAKING!!!!!**
**Dynamicism, self identity, reflexivity, self objectification**
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- uses symbolic interactionism to analyze the role of social interactions and significant symbols in dev of self and mind
- **CH Cooley** – looking glass self
    - We imagine what other think of us
    - Imagine ow we appear before others
    - We change our mood accordingly
    - This is social self – ability to be both object and subject – think what others are thinking of him
- Chicago school and the father of symbolic interactionism
- **Self and society are twin born**
- Self and society
    - Social act is when two or more people interact and communicate with each other and can **be simple or complex** transactions
    - **Society is sigma of social acts**
    - Gestures are the key mechanism through which social acts **are affected**
    - **Use significant symbol or gesture**
    - Gesture or symbol is basic mechanism of a Social act and can be **verbal or physical**, creating **significant gestures which have a common meaning to the people involved**, esp language which distinguishes humans from others
    - Benefits of significant gestures
        - Gesture and meanings are communicated (language – meaning is also communicated)
        - Elicit the same response between speaker and receiver
        - Potential of effective communication
        - Enables human thinking, which is the interaction between human and his mind; it is the conversation between I and me
    - He also says that social group comes first and it leads to the dev of self conscious mental state
    - Mind and Consciousness is developed due to presence of an existing social group and is responsible for social thinking
    - These symbols are used across different role taking stages to develop the notion of self and mind – and then go
- Self
    - Self: ability to be both object and subject
        - At birth we are devoid of social experiences;
        - We are not born with it; social relations and activities help in development of self; self develops with reflexivity
        - Self rises with human development and social interactions/ relations/ activities
- These interactions are facilitated by symbols and language
    - Mind and self are dialectically related
    - Body is not self; it becomes self when mind is developed
    - **Self and reflexiveness** is important for development of mind. Mind develops within the social process
    - Mind involves thought process oriented towards problem solving
    - Self presupposed social process
    - Once self is developed, it can be maintained even without social contact
    - Reflexitivity – unconsciously put yourself in place of others and act as they act
    - With development of self, People can evaluate themselves as they will be evaluated from outside (**Looking glass self theory of Cooley**). This development of self happens in phases and hence is an **evolutionary process + self helps in internal interaction as well as comm with mind**
    - Understand how to do conversation with others – what is being said and what needs to be said next
    - Over a period of time we start - Role taking by taking role of others and then looking at oneself (reflexivity)
    - This self identity or self awareness takes place as a result of role taking – reflexivity process of how others see us
    - Preparatory stage – as an infant, limited social experience and hence no role taking -> mimics without understanding the behavior
    - Play stage: when the children take particular roles or discrete others and have limited development of self as they start understanding language; lack a more generalized sense of self
        - Eg – doll mother -> understands mother and her are diff – so partial self awareness
    - Game stage: when they grow up, they can become self in full sense; take role of all others (generalized others)
        - Only when we take role of generalized others, we are complete members of society
        - Help in development of organized activities
        - We can do abstract thinking and objectivity
        - But there are many generalized others in the society, because there are many groups in the society
        - As a result each self is different based on the groups it’s a part of
        - Hence it s not that there is no individuality and everyone is a conformist
    - Most likely do what is expected of them to be done
    - Generalized other is the attitude of the entire community
    - People try to live up to group expectations
    - People put themselves in the same experimental field as they put everyone else
- I and me – Dualistic nature of self and relate to social experience.
    - Develop social perception, thinking, self consciousness, social interactions
    - Thinking is simply an internalized or implicit conversation of the individual with himself, by means of such gestures or it is a conv between I and me
    - I – spontaneous, immediate response of individual to others -> less socialized and doesn’t follow reflexivity
        - It is unpredictable and creative
        - Don’t know I – its surprising
        - Leads to novelty, dynamism and helps in developing a definite personality
        - Increasing dominance of I
        - We try to seek I so that we can understand ourselves
        - We are never totally aware of I and know about it only once act has been carried out
        - Imp – key source of novelty, shows our values and realism of self – permits us develop a definite personality
    - Me – Believe how generalized others see us – performs as conforming self
        - Individual acts in the way society expects it to
        - Knowledge about society and self
        - People learn to see who they are by observing responses of others
        - Me is a conventional habitual individual
        - Me involves conscious responsibility
        - Social self develops with the capacity to take role of others
        - Eg – respond as women ->> develop
    - Social control is dominance of me over I
    - So I prevents society from stagnating, while we ensures conformity and allow society to function effectively
    - But lgbtq?
- Inspired **Goffman’s** theory as well of impression mgt

- Origin not known only after 3 stafes
- Deviants are determined by I by me

- Characteristic of modern societies traditional societies
- Hence revolution dominated by I
- He argues that ind in their social interaction process are engaged in constant interaction between I and me - Conv between I and me (dialectics) determines our own socialization
- First reaction of ourself comes from I and is contradicted by self to make it socially acceptable
- Based on immediate reaction of I, me reflects on consequences
- Eg – consider pros and cons before we socialize
- Gave a socio psychological explanation when socio was dominated by macro theories
- Eg- **Ambedkar**

### CRITICISM
- Western ethnocentricism in concept of self – he sys self can exist w/o social conract but ignores the continuing role of social group on dev of self
- Doesn’t consider genetic influence
- **Ropers**: Social activities are discrete episodes and not in continuity according to **Mead**
- **Patrick Baert**: **Mead** saw social life as too consensual.
- Fail to elaborate origin of meaning
- Ignores historical settings and roles
- American determinism – too flexible
- Why all people behave the same way at times? Hence ignored social norms
- Neglected the influence of docial context in action – eg white clothes
- Counter – I brings dynamism to theory
- Explains generational gap

## DURKHEIM (INDISPENSABLE, SOCIAL COHESION, FUNCTIONALISM, SOCIAL FACT, CONCOMITANT, ULTIVARIATE)
**Integration**
**Social control**
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Functionalism – society works in a structured with recurrent patterns; every part has an imp role to play like an organism (developed by **Comte** and **Spencer**)
- Performs functional pre-requisites
- Teleological and tautology - teleology – use consequence as a cause ; taulogy – say the sme thing twice
- Society has its own reality beyond the individuals that comprise it
- Socio is the study of social facts using scientific methods
- – study of individual acts not same as collective behavior : It is a system of interdepdent parts which have functionality ancd indespensibility for maintaining social order
- Didn’t disregard individual factors but believed society has a stronger influence on people
- People’s norms, beliefs have an integrative role – develop collective conscience
- Looked at society and individuals as organs in a living organism
- Concl – understanding role of social facts, can better understand complexities of modern society
- Social facts
    - Social facts are ways of collective thinking, acting and feeling that exist outside individuals but endowed with the power of coercion by which they control him
    - Society is more than the sum of its individual acts AND different than sum of individuals (**sui generis**)
    - Characteristics of social facts
        - External - **Sui generis** (come from their own existence) eg – dometic/ civic/ contractual obligations or **RELIGION**
            - Social realism
            - A philosophy which explain any social institution existing independently of individuals
            - **Sui generis** means – implies that organs come into being with assemble or gathering of individuals
        - Constraining via coercion. It forces itself on individual
        - Generality - identify general types instead of particular types
        - Indepdenent of will of individual and taken collective by a group or society ; he is just a single element in the totality of the relationships which make up the society
    - Focused on both Material and non material social facts (like collective conscience and morality – earlier societies were held together due to strong collective conscience)
        - Material social fact is what is written, codified or directly observable eg const, new criminal laws, religious texts like Quran, housing arrangement
        - Non Material facts – not written or not directly observable SF – eg culture, religion, collective effervescence, social current, social cohesion, morality, value
        - CC maintains social order
        - NM SF are the cause behind SF; hence focus on nonmat SF
    - **ROSM**: Book to explain how SF can be studied empirically through scientific method
    - Rules of studying social fact
        - Rule of observation – study SF as things (naturally existing phenomena), treat individuals as atoms.
            - Atoms are governed by social facts
            - Patterned behaviours of atoms can be observed
            - which when observed show the definite reality rather than considering them as abstract ohenomena. identify objective manifestations of social facts – have definite reality
            - call data on patterned behaviour
        - Rules of classification
            - morphological (give society its appearance – distribution of pop, form of dwelling etc) – they make up substratum of collective life
            - , institutional (accepted by people and institutionalized – general and universalized )
            - non institutional (not accepted but can exert constraints such as a **mob** or sporadic ideas– also called social current)
        - Rules of distinction – normal and pathological state
            - Normal when they exist in the general form and fulfil the function in society. Things which are general and inevitable (crime)
            - Pathological when they deviate from the typical state and may be dysfunctional ; deviation from normal (eg spike in crime)
            - Eg crime – some rate normal
        - Differentiate between type of society
            - Bipolar model of society –
            - Simple or complex society
            - Typification will depend on degree of Specialization
        - Rules of explanation – complete objectivity and personal preoccupations should be kept aside. Yield general theory to establish cause effect relationship
            - Use various methods such as concainment, statistical analysis, indirect observation
            - Yield generalized theories which are not too specific
            - Formulate causal functiona theories ie separate cause and function to prevent illegimitate teleology
            - Eg – cause of infanticide is patriarchy
            - Understand function of social fact – its contribution to maintenance of society disorder
            - Test study of social fact causing another social fact by using comparative method => studied concomitant variation (how social fact was changing across diff groups)
                - Married, single; religious vs atheist
                - So degree of cohesion inversely proportional to suicide rate
                - Compare within society across diff social groups, across societies, within society in diff times
                - Comparative method is not just a mthod but sociology itself
    - Social facts exist in society like nature facts exist in science
    - Social facts help in developing universal laws of sociology
    - Subject matter of Socio should deal with general types instead of particular individual types i.e.e subject matter is social facts
    - Eg – laws, codes, religion, language
    - Book -> **Montesquieu** and **Rousseau** -> talked about principles to establish science of society which is **of general type**
    - **Rules of sociological method** – gave rules of studying the social facts
        - Read SF as things – they are concrete, stay for some time – visible manifestation of a social phenomena
        - May not be tangible but are visible
    - They are not abstract phenomena and can be visualized as objective reality
    - Socio research cannot ignore cause effect phenomena – every SF is caused by another SF
        - Identify cause of SF which lies in another SF
        - Determine function of the SF
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 44.png>)
    - Issues:
        - Individual meanings eg – suicide
        - Official stats
        - Not directly observable
        - Mono causal vs causal pluralism
- DOL
    - Book -> **DOL in society**
    - Developed in background of industrial revoltuon and society held together even with increasing heterogeneity
    - Hedonism / utilitarianism rejected
        - Not based in his pleasure or interest
        - Rejected **Comte** – DOL not reason of disorder in society
    - Splitting of work in smaller parts or processes, undertaken by diff people
    - Not only in economics but even home which is a social phenomena
    - Used evolutionary perspective to show it is a SF – sui generis and independent
    - In simple society, social bond was based on mechanical solidarty
        - Mechanical solidarity was a result of individuals sharing beliefs and lifestyles; means resemblance, character of simple society where people differ as little as possible
        - existed as homogenous units, material density was low (number of people) -> collective conscience V high
        - Also called classless/ primitive society/ tribal society
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 45.png>)
    - Has social controls to ensure conformity to the will of community
    - Repressive laws
    - In Complex society, high organic solidarity
        - OS – inter-dependence due to high specialization of work eg – mobile phone, coaching centre
        - moral density (interaction amongst people), dynamic density increased so organic solidarity
        - dynamic density increase as number of people and interaction amongst them increased
        - as pop increase, demand for resources and occupation increase so specialized stay in this occupation, others make a new occupation -> DOL
        - laws are reformative
        - ideas are empowering but no means to achieve these goals
        - Now as specialization increase, overall resource increase -> heterogeneity of relations -
    - Social bonds exist in both societies, but social bond was different

|   |   |
|---|---|
|- Mechanical solidarity|- Organic solidarity (solidarity in modern society due to interdepdence because of specialization and division of work)|
|- Low material density|- High material density (people migrate to urban areas -> so a conflict possible as people are more than work. So work fragmented and given to people leading to inter-depdendence)|
|- Homogenous units|- Hetero|
|- No specialized DOL|- Specialized DOL and interdepdence|
|- Repressive law|- Restitutive low|
|- higher|- Low social cohesion|
|- Altruistic fatalistic|- Others|
    - Cause – solidarity based on specialized skills
    - DOL functional for society as:
        - Drives integration of society – via dependency ; at subconscious level – dependent even when independent at conscious level
        - autonomy of individual to be innovative
    - individual while trying to be **autonomous** becomes more dependent on society
    - when society transforms from simple to complex, the current of -anomie unleashes (anomie is a state of moral disruption or phase where desires of individuals are not regulated enough)
    - in modern society, desires are unlimited and when they cant fulfil these desires, they go to deviance
    - ways in which society transitions
        - economic boom – with EB, individuals cut away from old social ties and may become atomized
        - economic bust – lose jobs or employment -> cant fulfil dreams, so depression
        - natural disaster – like EQ, cyclone may atomize individuals as they feel alone
        - tech disruptions – like AI will make individuals unemployed
        - abnormal forms of DOL
            - pathological form happens when work is meant for individual well being and not collective well being
            - Anomic DOL
                - When social capital takes precedence over merit
                - anomic happens during transition as **wants and expectations** disrupted – it is a situation where old collective consciousness is absent and new is not achieved
                - people do not follow norms attached to their situation
                - anomie means normlessness and lack of **social cohesion**
                - Promotes SELF INTEREST WHICH IS A THREAT TO ORGANIC SOLIDARITY
                - relevance today – avoids alienation, Expertise such as **Fordism** and **Taylorism** , neet
                - need code of ethics
                - labor generates unhealthy comp and becomes dysfunctional
            - Inadequate coordinated DOL – meaningless tasks and inefficient DOL eg – delayed payments eg MNREGA 36%
            - FORCED dol – comes into force when merit is taken over by ascriptive statuses (eg sex, religion, caste) eg – manual scavengers/ power elite/ a rickshaw puller forced to work in one, glass ceiling (eg – self recruitment theory of Glass). Person starts feeling lower solidarity with the role
        - All of them become atomized and have weakened sense of cohesion among them
    - Hence, need support of state to take action (this was in response to **Adam Smith** theory that DOL is a function of market)
        - State is embodiment of morality and can impart sense of cohesion
        - eg – digital law, trade union, equal wage roles, national suicide policy, moral edu such as ethics paper, MNREGA, state awards like ratnas, Atma nirbhar
        - eg – manual scavengers – state comes into play with manual scavenging prevention act
        - eg – women reservation bill
    - criticized for being top down + underplayed role of economic factors
        - **Harry Braverman** – ignores the degradation of work
        - **David Lockwood** – confuses inter depdendence with integration (social vs system integration)
        - **Merton** – dysfunctional aspects of work + strain theory – not only normlessness but srain
        - **Malinowski** – criticizes for equating DOL with progress
        - **Ulrich Beck** (**Risk societies**) – reflexive modernization – uncertainty of labor market due to human made risks
        - Cant explain forced attrition
        - **Talcott Parsons** questioned the applicability of **Durkheim’s** concepts to non-Western societies, arguing that the distinction between mechanical and organic solidarity may not be relevant in differen cultural contexts.
- Suicide
    - **Le Suicide**
    - Way of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative action performed by the victim himself and which he knows will produce this result (led to inter subject reliability)
    - **Durkheim** claim as a social fact clear shift from considering it a psychological phenomena. He never wanted to study individual phenomena but why
        - Why suicide diff in diff societies
        - Why rate almost constant
        - Why changes from one group to another in society
    - Suicide rate: rate of suicides per lakh pop
    - He used rules of sociological method and applied scientific method to study suicide rate
        - Data frompolice official stats
        - Data classification based on religion, marriage, age etc
        - Analyzed any correlation between 2 variables (degree of cohesion as part of group and suicide rate) and used concomitant method to prove no correlation between psychological or alcohol rates
        - Did **multivariate analysis** – in order to understand which variable has had higher impact on suicide, kept few variables constant and studied relation with others
        - Developed causation: social cohesion defines rate of suicide
        - Generalization – higher cohesion, lower suicide rate
    - He studied 2 types of societies: simple society and complex society and found that since simple have higher cohesion, lesser suicide rates vs complex have lesser cohesion so higher suicide rate
    ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 46.png>)2 types of bonds integrate individuals with society - forces of **integration** and forces of **regulation**
    - anomic/ fatalistic –
        - Anomic
            - when normlessness leads to suicide, anomic
            - no rules to protect individuals
            - new standards not developed and existing are not accepted
            - talks about 2 different types of anomic – economic anomie and domestic anomie
            - can be chronic (prolonged) or acute (all of a sudden)
            - chronic economic anomie – prolonged economic distress eg farmer suicides
            - acute economic – economic depression
            - chronic domestic – extreme isolation eg Dalits/ SC/ ST
            - acute domestic – divorce
            - **Merton** says happens due to anomie
            - eg – “Blue whale challenge”, reverse migrants, farmer suicides in case of uncertainity
        - Fatalistic – such excess regulations that person feels suffocated and death is the only solution eg , 50+ suicides in colombo prison in 2023, rape victim, slaves
        - rate of suicide inversely proportional to degree of solidarity
    - altruistic/ egoistic
        - Altruistic
            - over integration – traditional
            - degree of integration is extremely high and individualism is dead
            - unquestioned integration to society
            - high degree of organic solidarity
            - married have less suicide
            - eg – suicide bombers/ Sallekhana/ hunger strikes
        - Egoistic- too focused on individual interests that at pinaccle of success, he realizes what he has lost in life eg farmers (death every 2 hours in 2021), SC students in IIT, Kota mechanical coaching, celebrity suicide
    - did a multivariate analysis based on social factors and material factors + conclusions
        - Suicide is a social phenomena – no relation with material factors
        - Suicide is a social fact
        - Took police data
        - No relaltion between suicide and non social phenomena like stress or race or alcoholism ( Looked at geo and psychological causes also but no correlation)
        - protestant
            - protestant have higher suicide because they live a life of work and solidarity
            - they have more space for achievement as allowed
            - so they do not have social bondage
            - they look at the success of other achieves – feel life is wasted
            - they marry late or don’t marry - workaholics
            - in case of church, since social bondage is high – the group gives them strength to survive
        - Elderly – less likely to do suicide as they know their years are limited and hence live life more
        - Teenagers – more suicide as their attachment and social bondage is weak – solidarity with community is weak
        - Man rate more than women- no relation between alcoholism, emotion or drugs – they do that to enjoy life
        - Climate and suicide
            - Winter – less deaths as more festivals so higher social solidarity
            - Ritual is a social battery
            - It is not the climate but the ritual estivities that decide rate of suicide
        - Rate of suicide is same across traditional and modern societies – it is just that rate of suicide is reported in modern society
        - Socio is concerned with rate of suicide and not incident of suicide
        - Universal phenomena - certain rate is normal
        - Underdeveloped countries have less rate of suicide
    - Suicidogenic current (suicidogenic impulse) – while individual factors play a role (psychological pre disposition), society plays major rule to push – collective tendencies that dominate the susceptible individuals an catch them in their sweep
    - **Robert Beard** – more suicides in modern society rather than traditional society
    - **Jean Bachelor** -> developed individual suicides typology
    - Once suicide is committed, society Readjust forces to restore normal rate
    - Solution to suicide
        - Family does not provide enough support + state is too authoritiative
        - So need an institution suchas corporates which is superior to labour unions which just intsensify the differences with managers
        - These are occupational groups
    - In india
        - Farmer
            - A: Without benefits of govt support reaching them
            - F: due to forced labor and sharecropping
            - E: when crop fails and he feels isolated under debt
            - Al: whole family commits suicide
        - Women
            - A: With marital rape not decriminalized
            - F: Lack of employment
            - E: Hyper reality and zero figure / glass ceiling/ glass cliff
            - Al: Save honour of fam after rape
        - Youth
            - A: Blue whale
            - F: Kota
            - E: Isolation and peer group
            - Al: parent expectation
    - Distinct methods used:
        - Concomitant
        - Multi variate analysis
        - Inter reliable def
        - Use of sociological concepts
        - Comparative analysis
        - Longitudinal studies
- Religion (social cohesion, solidarity, sacred profane collective effervescence)
    - It is not an individual experience/ **supernatural inspiration** but a social experience external to an individual
    - Studied religion in a simple and promitive society of Arunta tribe
    - Defined religion in **Elementary forms of religious life** USING functionalist perspective
    - **Unified system of beliefs** and practices **relative to the sacred things**, that is to say things set **apart and forbidden**. Beliefs and practices which **unite in one single community** called a church those who adhere to them
    - Features of religion
        - When people come together, it creates a phenomena called traditional, practices, rites or rituals of individuals
        - These rituals will take place around a totem;
            - Can be an animal/ vegetable inaminate objects, Tree which represents a collective representation of collective sentiment
            - Totem becomes the representation of the clan – jal, zameen, jungle
            - Totems are the most elementary form for dev of religion and explain origin of religion
        - Totem was considered sacred (apart and forbidden) and rest of world was ordinary (eg ganga vs other rivers)
        - Gives totemic principles: Workship of totem meant worship of collective sentiment ; hence religion is nth but society’s own worship
        - towards sacred – can be positive or negative
    - **Durkheim** identified 4 types of rites
        - **Sacrificial** rites – specifiy and regulate the obligations that objects have towards the group
        - **Imitative** rites – can imitate similar to the totem for purpose of reproduction
        - **Commemorative** rites – how the group represents itself to others
        - **Piacular** rites – represent loss or suffering
    - FUNCTIONS
        - Euphoria: brings highly excited state of affairs among individuals, It transcends individuals from world of profane and sacred
        - Social cohesion and integration : brings people together or binds them into a social bond (eg WC got Indians together)
        - social control : regulates desires of individuals and keep their needs limited. Makes them conformist and evades deviance
        - social cognition – it gives cognitive capacity to individuals to explain inexplicable, tolerate intolerable, poverty, death, failure
        - Collective conscience – provides a **sense of identity**
        - Now : PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING eg meditation AND EMOTION SUPPORT
        - Ramayana helped during Mahabharat
        - Can be a base for social change eg nationalism
    - Cause of religion is Sense of collective effervescence - they feel empowered by a source greater than self
    - New forms in modern times
        - Any practice that brings people together in a common belief around what they regard as sacred can classify as religion
        - Elections – idea of India
        - **Bellah** – seen in civil religion of flag, cricket etc
        - Cricket
        - Nationalism like republic day – civil religion and Indian flag is the totem
        - Constitution
        - Social movements like LGBTQ, Feminist movements
        - Tribal worship of rivers and trees
        - Rise of “cult of individual ” – person as sacred eg **Osho** , hathras case – sacred – no feet touch
    - SACRED – things which are **transcendental and extraordinary** with moral superiority ->
    - Profane are things which are mundane – part of everyday life
    - Totem is symbolic manifestation of kinship and society - easier to direct feelings towards a thing rather than complex society

### CRITICISM
- **Merton** – need mid range theories
- **Weber** – social facts don’t exist on their own as pebbles to be gathered on the beach -> leads to methodolical challenges
- **Peter Berger** – injustice by ignoring individual human behavior
- **Heidleman** – too busy explaining society that he didn’t explain any method for it
- **Coser** – too much importance to society, ignores individual
- Too universalistic and do not have practical significance

- Couldn’t explain why same social fact has diff impact on diff people
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 54.png>)
- Too grand so ignore nuances
- **Giddens** – apparent moral ambiguity between individual and society in the modern world
- **Tarde** – difficult to understand how society exists w/o individual
- **Stephen Lukes** (**Power – a radical view**) – neglected emotions and individual behaviour
- **Anthony Giddens** – didn’t consider the interplay between material and non material faycs which are intertwined and have a symbiotic relation to shape human behavior
- Suicide
    - Called empirical generalization
    - **Atkinson** (**discovering suicide**) – quality of data
    - Didn’t include attempted suicides
    - Need to focus on causal pluralism approach which is more comprehensive and holistic
    - **Gibbs** and **Martin** – not positivist as suicodogenic not empirically measured
    - **Raymond Arcon** – need to focus on personal experiences of people
    - Why only a few commit suicide?
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 55.png>)
- Can use high integration, high regulation on x, y axis

## CHAPTER 5

## INEQUALITY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Intro
    - Modern idea of equality emerged from enlightenment as well as rise of capitalism with bourgeoise challenging nobility hereditary rights
    - Social differences are historical, but attachment of value to these differences leads to inequality
    - Different individuals are associated to different groups and evaluated differently
    - Equality means members of society have equal access to wealth, power, prestige etc
    - Patterns of difference in access to social -economic opportunities and resources lead to social inequality
    - Can be micro or macro (developed vs developing vs underdeveloped vs least developed countries)
    - It is a mental construct via differentiation (people with differences), ranking (preliminary ranking based on comparison), evaluation (attaching values to the differences), rewarding
    - **Andre Beteille** -> Inequality can be harmonic (inequality preached as a practice eg caste historically) or disharmonic (where preached vs practice are different)
- Reasons
    - **Rousseau**: 2 types of inequality (physical and moral/ political)
    - **Bourdieu**: 4 types of inequality and deprivation (economic capital, social capital, cultural capital, symbolic capital); these capitals may overlap – ALWAYS USE IN INEQUALITY
    - **Marx**: Due to difference in ownership of means of production and dependency theory
    - Functionalists: Inevitable to be able to perform all jobs
    - **Haralombus** and **Holborn** (**Sociology – themes and perspectives**): Inequality of power and inequality of material well being. They become repressive when aggressilevly enforced such as slavery
    - **Peter Saunders** – equality of 3 types – legal equality, equality of outcome, equality of opportunity (meritocracy – everyone has an equal chance of becoming unequal)
- Impact
    - Such inequalities lead to poverty and deprivation (**Merton**)
        - Deprivation has multiple dimensions such as health edu sanitation info legal aid etc
        - can be absolute or relative deprivation
    - **Goran Therborn** (**the killing fields of inequality**): Analyzed types and impact of inequality incl. ill health, crime, discrimation, poverty, health edu; exclusion of poor has to be eliminated
        - caused by **systematic arrangements**, processes and distributive actions, both individual and collective
    - **Wilkinson** and **Pickett** (**The spirit level: why more equal societies almost always do better**)– not only harmful for individual but also dysfunctional for society
    - **Bryan Turner** (**EQUALITY**) – Equality includes fundamental equality of a person,, equality of opportunity, equality of condition, equality of outcome
- Contemporary
    - Modern measures: GINI Coefficient, human development index
    - Provisions: Constitution DPSP, FR, Schemes like PDS, DBT, Subsidies, social security, progressive taxation
    - India: 10% people hold 70% wealth
    - **Sen** – I believe all problems in the world come from inequality of one kind or another
    - Equality can be legal, political, economic, social
- Talent Allocation: • Increased mobility can lead to a more efficient allocation of talent,
- Social and Cultural Integration: • Mobility can promote greater social and cultural integration,

## POVERTY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Intro
    - **John Sinclair** and **FM Eden** - Social problem involving lack of access to material resources required for basic subsistence and minimum standard of life (**Amartya Sen** and mdp)
    - **Ruth Lister** (**Poverty**) – definition of poverty has important implications for **political, policy and academic** discourse
        - Defined in economic and material well being terms only
    - Absolute poverty (poverty line at 1.9), relative poverty such as **Stauffer’s American soldier** or multi-dimensional poverty (imp for socioligists to evaluate if other needs beyond basic economic needs are also being met for a decent quality of life)
- Dimensions
    - Dimensions of poverty: social, cultural, digital, political, info, health, edu, finance
- Causes
    - Causes of poverty: economic, social, cultural factors
    - **Different views on origin and prevalence of poverty**
        - Blame the poor (limited motivation) or blame the system approach (limited avenues for social mobility)
        - The cultural perspective
            - (**Oscar Lewis** – social atmosphere of poor perpetuate poverty); tribals are poorer than average population by more than 40%. This happens due to world view, aspiration, experiences
            - Poverty not a result of individual shortcomings but the culture
        - Viscous cycle/ poverty trap – poverty to poor edu to poverty
        - Functional theories (**Herbert Gans** in **More Equality**)
        - Dialectical approach (**Marx**) and mismatch between use value and exchange value of labor
        - Feminist approach
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 56.png>)
        - **Diana Pearce** – disproportional women in poor due to lack to opportunity, male bias, household chores, wage pay, unpaid domestic work, lack of skills
            - **Glass ceiling**
            - **Pink collarization**
            - **Glass cliff**
            - Environment impact on women: more women are expected to be impacted by climate change than men
            - Poverty of women hidden in poverty of household study
        - Power and poverty (**Milband** – poor are the weakest in struggle for scarce resources)
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 57.png>)
        - Institutions (**Myrdal** – lack of education and political systems)
        - **Prahlad** – poverty need not be looked at from benevolent perspective – capitalists can earn while making lives better
        - **Rajni**, **AR Desai**, inequality, migration
- Types of poverty
    - Economic poverty
    - Information poverty – no linkedin, edu,
    - Energy poverty – deprivation of electricity – lack of access to water, internet , social exclusion
    - Capability poverty – deprivation of capaibiluty – capability to earn
    - Culture poverty – **Oscar Lewis** – limit goals – social exclusion but living for today
- Exclusion to poverty
    - Social exclusion from labor market - Student, unemployed, retired
    - From social relations – transgenders, “othering”, minorities HIV, disabled
- Many other factors can lead to dev of both
- Solutions to poverty
    - Redistribution of wealth
    - Marxists socialism
    - Inst reforms with schools
    - Feminist – protection laws eg equal wages act
    - reservation
- Concl
    - **Aristotle** – poverty is the parent of revolution and crime
    - **Shastri** – we cannot afford to spend millions and millions on nuclear arms when we have poverty all around us
    - **Gandhi** – poverty is the worst form of violence
    - **Gandhi** – a nation’s greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members
    - **Nelson Mandela** – overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity but an act of justice
    - **Mandela** – poverty is not accident. Like apartheid, it is man made and can be removed by actions of human beings
- **Ruth Lister** – women are over-represented in poverty while they face other kinds of deprivation even within the household

### CRITICISM
- Intersectionality – black homo poorafrican women – low life chance
- Techniques or tool to understand interwing or interpay of multiple marginalizing identities on individuals
- **Kimberle Crenshaw**
    - She argues we must use intersectional angle while analyzing gender, race inequality
    - Understand inequality more comprehensively
- Gender intersects with all other dimensions and not influence all by itself
    - So gender class eg – poor woman eg MNREGA
    - Gender intersect race – black woman

## EXCLUSION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Intro
    - **Haralambos**: Situation where multiple deprivations prevent participation in social activities
    - **Ruth Lister**: Prevention of having the same opportunities that are available to majority population (Book: **Poverty**)
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 58.png>)Dimensions
- **Amartya Sen** – exckusion is not ltd to food, shelter and clothing but political participation, access to edu, health, sanitation etc
- **Mary Daly**: concept is wider than poverty as not only economic inclusion but other dimensions also in social processes
- **Anthony Giddens** – homelessness worst form of social exclusion as deprives from other services
- **Merton** – deliberate exclusion due to anticipatory socialization and marginal man
- **Marx** saw exclusion as a form of alienation
- Characteristics
    - **Weber** – form of social closure where one group attempts to secure a privileged position for themselves and prevents others from becoming a part of the group
    - Usually systematic and not accidental based on societal structure; is intentional
    - Can be individual or collective
    - Social exclusion
        - Stratification and poverty increase exclusion
        - Curtailment of social rights and privileges
        - Exclusion from friends family or society
- Types of exclusion
    - From social rights
    - Education (**Oscar Lewis**- discrimination in labor market may prevent inv in edu) + (exc from schools after class 8)
    - Homelessness (worst acc to **Giddens** as automatically excludes others)
    - Political rights
    - Religious
    - Educational
    - Health
    - Financial and credit
    - Societal participation (dalit entering temple)
    - Labour market (white black)
    - Lead to high delinquent behavior (**Elliot Curie**)
    - Can lead to alienation
    - IR – Africa/ N korea/ Russia
- EG – LGBTQ, Women, Caste system, Apartheid in South Africa
- Steps – const, UNDHR, Reservation, RTE
- **Sen** – progress is more plausibly judged by reduction of deprivation than by further enrichment of opulent

## SOCIAL STRATIFICATION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Intro
    - **Tumin** – arrangement of any social group or society hierarchy of positions that are unequal with regard to power, property, social evaluation and psychic gratification
    - **Sutherland** and **Maxwell**: As a process of differentiation, which places some people higher than others
    - Structural hierarchy with some strata placed above others
- Process
    - 4 steps followed:
        - Differentiation (which may exist naturally or by society and can be perceived by people in society)
        - Evaluation: evaluate in terms of prestige, status, honour, income etc, leading to inferiority/ superiority
        - Ranking: when different strata are compared
        - Reward: reward/ punish different strata based on the evaluation and ranking attached
- Types
    - Can be open or closed stratification. Open stratification has social mobility to move from one strata to another (eg, bureaucracy)
    - But stratification need not always be hierarchical; **Dipankar Gupta**: “**it will be futile and even capricious to hierarchize languages or religions or nationalities**
- Sources
    - **Bottomore** defined 4 types of social stratification traditionally – slaves (vs citizens), estate (during feudal time – nobility, clergy and serf), caste (SS by birth), class (by economic factors)
- Social stratification by functionalists
    - Stratas exist to be able to perform certain functions/ menial jobs in the society
    - **Parsons**:
        - Every society is based on consensus of norms and values due to cybernatic
        - He said there are differential rewards for differential strata in society
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 59.png>)
        - These differential rewards lead to stratification
        - Stratification is inevitable as value consensus s an integral part of all types of society
        - functional requisites, explaining each function is a pre-requisite to the survival of a social system.
        - Critique
            - **Dahrendorf**: stratification is a result of closely related trinity of power, norms and sanction and not only functional pre-requisites
            - Elite self recruitment not considered
            - **Turner**: structural Functionalism struggles with illegitimate teleologies
            - **Beck** and **Baudrillard** – caste system rigidity cant be explained and now, inequalities are more individual based
            - **Gouldner** – social stratification not inevitable and criticizes for justifying inequality
            - Also, **Parson’s** theory exist only if everyone has equal opportunities
    - **WL Warner**
        - Further propagated the concept of differential rewards based on social status as a base of stratification
        - Social status – edu, occupation and income
        - _The social life of modern community_
    - **Davis** and **Moore** (**Some principle of social stratification**)
        - **MERITOCRACY**
        - **SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND INEQUALITY**
        - **ROLE ALLOCATION**
        - **VALUE CONSENSUS**
        - **SCARCITY OF TALENT AND DIFFERENTIAL REWARD**
        - **MOTIVATION**
        - **COMPENSATION**
        - Human societies are universally stratified
        - Some positions are seen as functionally more imp than others
        - Talent is considered scarce and hence social stratification is a way of attracting talented and meritocratic people in role allocation to fill more imp positions
        - These positions are exclusive and less in number
        - A lot of people are dependent on them
        - More important positions are paid a higher reward since they have talent and skills which are unique, and its needed to motivate them to service these positions
        - They have to sacrifice when they undergo training as some functions are more important than others
        - Hence social stratification is inevitable in any society
        - Rewards attract as an incentive to attract these people – status, wealth, power
        - They don’t question system but accept, creating a value consensus in society
        - Relevance in India – NEET, UPSC, SSC - np, as power is a more dominant source of inequality rather than awards + people of same talent get occupy higher position
        - Critique
            - **Melvin Tumin**: Opposed **David** and **Moore**
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 60.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 61.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 62.png>)
            - Difficult to determine relative importance of positions in an objective manner, talent and mobility
            - Rewards are not correlated with importance of position eg – a corporate slave vs chief minister (high importance, low reward) or SRK vs IAS
            - It is not the only motivational factor
            - If merit was sole criteria, then weaker sec would not have been underrepresented – so No equal opportunity eg UNDP data, IIM has upper class professors
            - Dysfunctional because it makes barriers to entry for underprivileged, reducing talent availability
            - Lead to maintenance of status quo, even when its dysfunctional and resulting in hostility
            - Trainees are not making a sacrifice other than suspended income
            - Social stratification is not always unity but prmote conflict – civil liberation movement
            - Countered by **David Moore** – judge based on uniqueness
            - **PINK COLLARIZATION**, **SOCIAL CAPITAL**, **STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS**, **GLASS CEILING**, **CASTE BASED CONSTRAINTS**, **POVERTY AND INEQUALITY**
- **Marx**
    - Strat refers to economic and vertical division in society
    - Stratification based on ownership of means and forces of production
    - Structure: have/ have nots
    - A minority has ownership of resources, leading to oppression of the lower strata who don’t own these resources
    - Hence product of dialectical materialism, unequal ownership and subsequent class formation
    - Consequence: class struggle
    - Universality: end of stratification with communism
    - **Charles Murray** – concept of underclass – people with little bargaining power and at mercy of employer eg minority and women
    - Critique
        - Social mobility will increase in future, with emergence of welfare state and middle class
- **Weber**
    - Saw stratification in a multi-dimensional view of class, status and power called **trinitarian model**
    - Happens because of unequal distribution of property, prestige, power
    - Class:
        - Defined class as a group of people with similar positions in the economic or market position, because of which they have similar life chances
        - Not a community
        - Related to unequal distribution of economic rewards
        - People with similar life chances have similar class
            - Life chance is level of opportunity to access good standard of life
        - Based on education and skills and not means of Production ownership
        - 4 classes: propertied upper class, property less white collar, petty bourgeoisie, manual workers
        - Have different skills and ownership on means of production
        - No evidence of polarization – instead middle class will swell (proliferation of MC)
        - No difference of community feelings (unlike **Marx**) – not a homogenous group because diff interests and prestige enjoyed differentiate their collective - consciousness
        - No abolition of pvt property – equality not necessary, infact it will take new forms
    - Status group
        - **Social group awarded similar amount of honor and share same position**
        - These are communities
        - Can be status group (a group of people enjoying honour from majority of individuals) or status less group
        - Related to unequal distribution of honour
        - Practice endogamy eg – inter caste
        - They follow certain rules and manners
        - Pass on same value system to next gen
        - Enjoy prestige due to their lifestyle (Refers to way of life chosen by individual)
            - Internal to individual – choice is individuals
            - Eg – IAS officer 2 sons – each has same life chance but diff lifestyle
            - Defines honour inequality in society (lifechance defines eco inequalities in soc)
            - Doesn’t necessarily lead to status inequalities
        - Eg – president delegation, exclusive clubs like gymkhana, sherpas, brahmans
        - Closed status group (closure)
        - Possession of property, and resource not always associated with status
        - Dependent on multiple factors such as knowledge, occupation, income, honour, social capital etc.
        - Consumers of goods and not producers of goods
        - Aware of their status eg Brahmins or untouchables
        - Traditional societies – ascriptive, modern societies achievement based
        - Usually more closed groups and have certain qualifiers for others
        - **Pakulski** and **Waters** – status is becoming more imp than economic class as cons is based on status (eg spending on marriage based on status and not economic capacity)
    - Party
        - Parties are structures who want to gain power (be at state or non state institution)
        - Usually represent class or status groups (not always)
        - Parties of patronage and parties of principle
    - Hence he concluded power property and prestige not necessarily correlated. Goes against Marxist idea of eco as deterministic factor
    - Application
        - Socio economic caste census – looks at diff
        - Surveys are very comprehensive
        - Eg – global gender gap, MDI
    - Critique
        - **Cellia Heller**: Status and class often inter related
            - Counter – usually bit not always + homo a status group across classes
        - **Ulrich Beck**:
            - Risk based stratification - inequality based on risk taking capability
            - Induced by modern society such as terrorism, innovation etc
        - Marxist – conflict theory
        - Feminist – ignores gender stratification
        - **Runciman** – 7 classess and not 4
        - **CW Mills** – new type of power elite
    - Illustrations
        - Individual with wealth may command little prestige or power eg = lottery, inherit wealth
        - Individuals with status may not have wealth eg – social woker, great Thunberg, people who are ascetics
        - With status but no power – eg ex PM, e x bureucrats, celebs
        - Status could be source of power – media ccelebs, Kangana ranaut
        - Wealth could be source of power – ambani
    - Reality is **multi dimensional if unit of analysis is individual actor**, class power status may not correlate. This analysis brings us **closer to individuals in every day** life insyead of **Marxian class abstraction**
    - **Inspired AB**

## RACE BASED STRATIFICATION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Concept of race was propagated by Europeans in 17th century to promote Whites as superiors
- Race is defined a group of people perceived different from others often based on their history, ancestors, birth and physical characteristics, molded by dominating group in the society
- It is riddled with prejudice and discrimination based on observable differences between people
- Loaded with prejudices, stereotypes and preconceived notions
- Multiple theories were formulated to support this claim in 18th and 19th century incl: (overt racism)
    - White Man burden by **Rudyard Kipling**
    - Ethnocentrism
    - Apartheid
- Formed the basis of colonial imperialism and **Hitler** to promote Aryans
- But after WW2, race based discrimination has been legally abolished; so race stratification is practiced in subtle ways
- Instances of race stratification (covert racism)
    - Blacks vs whites in USA (ferguson, US killing) – black lives matter
    - Whites vs non-whites
    - Migration being blamed for economic slowdown
    - Apartheid of South Africans
    - Italian migrants were discriminated in post war USA – Became mafias
    - As migration increased, blame for employment
    - S korea discrimination
    - **Robert Merton** – every coloured American is following the culturally acceptable goals through societal means but still subjected to discrimination
- Thinkers explaining race stratification:
    - **OC Cox**: from a conflict theory, ruling class used race to dominate, exploit the labour (**class caste and race**)
    - **Paul Thirst**: Race is a product of capitalism
    - **Collin Brown** and **Pat Gray** – telephonic interview where black was denied vs white was selected
    - **Milton Younger**: race is concerned with biology and has no relevance to social science
        - **Richardson** and **Lambert** – race is nth to do with birth but instead is a social construction
    - **Ralph Ellison**: atrocities faced by black men on account of colour, such as ghettoization
    - **Merton**: Deviance theory for Americans
- Caste based stratification
    - Edu – **Satish Deshpande** – 3% in higher edu despite 13% in pop – hindu upper caste men
    - **Andre** – 95% Manual scavengers dalits

## ETHNICITY BASED STRATIFICATION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Socially constructed stratification – both race and ethnicity

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Race|ETHNICITY|
|- Describes physical traits like skin, hair, facial and body type|- Refers to cultural traits like religion, language, food, nationality|
|- Race is inherited|- Learnt and maintained though activities like wearing certain dress and eating certain kind of food|
|- Individuals usually belong to one race|- Individual may belong to multiple ethnic groups – eg, individual could be afro-american protest charoci|
|- Often used as a marker of superiority and inferiority|- Ethnicity are never arranged in hierarchies, rather viewed as diverse groups with diverse customs|
|- Punjabi, north Indian, Indian, language is also ethnic group,|   |
|- Similarity|   |
|- Refers to unequal distribution of life chances between ethnic and racial groups<br>- Both are social constructs – not based on objective, biological or genetic differences rather products of social categorization<br>- Life chances depend on both eg – Black and white president<br>- Both impact social interactions – stereotypes, prejudices, biases<br>- Both have had historical significance – both have played significant role in shaping societies<br>- Modernization school believes that ascriptive status like caste, ethnicity, race, linguistic identity declines and achievement orientation based on individual merit becomes the new norm (**Parsons**)<br>- Ethnicity today is hyper visible in following fronts<br>    - Rise of ethnic associations – caste based associations eg Jatt Mahasabha – pressure group and political parties<br>    - Linguistic associations – Dravidian samiti, hindi sabha<br>    - Religious groups – hindu Mahasabha, hindu Mahasabha<br>    - Regional identities (gorkha, boro, Khalistan)<br>- Ethnic identity is visible in politics – policisation of ethnicity and ethno- nationalism eg gorkha and bodo regiment (**Earnest Geller**)<br>- Ethnic diversity is hyper visible in social media and bollyeood eg – big fat Punjabi wedding , Haryana – stereotypes<br>- Caste relevance<br><br>In workplace<br><br>- Bamboo– refers to non-natives like non whites from rising to top positions – leads to dev of sticky floor phenomena by which young Asian professionals are often trapped in low level, low mobility jobs<br>- canvas ceiling – jobs not suitable for whites – usually migrants in specific kinds of jobs eg nursing – most are black , security guard Nepal (bahadur), truck drivers, restaurants in CP<br><br>Income level in USA<br><br>- White Americans earn disproportionately higher than black americans and indo americans (30% are living in poverty)<br>- **Colin**<br><br>Politics – white dominant, hindu dominated<br><br>Edu – ivy leagure – whites protestants|   |
- Ethnic group is a group that shares some socio-cultural characteristics or markers
- Socially designed category of people who identify with each other based on common ancestors, culture, religion, national origin or lifestyle
- Three key conceptions – biological, cultural, psychological
- It is a very elastic concept. It is possible to change ethnicity by adaptation, migration, language shift, culturalization etc.
    - Melting pot – when different ethnicities merge into one, such as US
    - Pluralist co-existence like India
    - Antagonist co-existence such as Sri Lanka (Tamil and Singhalese)
- Often result in exclusionary devices such as inter-ethnicity marriage or discrimination as well as **ethno violence (eg Kuki meitis conflict)**
- Thinkers
    - **Collin Brown** and **Pat Gray**
    - **Paul Thirst**: Capitalism will keep working class divided
    - **Habermas**: with rising modernization, please use ethnicity to keep themselves unique
    - **Karl Deutsch**: ethnicity led to rise of nations in Europe – Balkanisation
    - **Glazer** – ethnicity will reemerge in reaction to modernization
- Eg – US Harvard – culture day
- Growing salience of ethnicity
    - **Paul Brass** – “**Ethnicity and state**” – 3 types of ethnic movements
        - Intra ethnic – shia and sunni in ME
        - Inter ethnic – bodo movement
        - Ethnic group vs state – naga
    - Reasons
        - Economic – Jharkhand
        - Relative deprivation – metis and kuskis
        - Social discrimination -
        - Tech advancement –
        - Sons of soil – Khalistan
        - Internal colonialism – dominant community vs periphera – pathalgadhi
        - Identity loss – bangaldesh
        - Historical reasons – nagas
        - Political centralization – israel hamas

## CLASS BASED STRATIFICATION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **BB Mishra** - **NEW MIDDLE CLASS**: It is a class of/ group of individuals who are beneficiaries of LPG (IT professionals)
- Eg – IT professionals
- Features of new MC
    - It is the major engine of consumption
    - It is the consumerist class
    - They prefer hassle free process in everyday life – digital services
    - They always keep a check
    - - They are torch bearers of new social movements eg LGBTQ, - global class
    - They have entrepreneurial spirit - start up culture
    - Vocal on social media
    - NMC is more socially inclusive than old – has diff religions and castes
    - Hegemony of Hindu upper caste men is not strong enough in MNC – has non hindu, low caste and women
- Thinkers
    - **Weber** and **Marx** definitions (above)
    - More economic concept, where high fluidity in theoretical terms
    - **Dahrendorf** – class stratification is not so much rife with antagonism as **Marx** has visualized
    - **Bottomore**: 4 types of classes – upper, middle, working and peasantry
    - **Giddens**: dominant upper class, middle class, working class
    - **Bourdieu**: class with economic capital – industrial capitalist, symbolic capital – political capitalist, cultural capital – knowledge capitalist
    - Govts adopting better opportunities and redistribution of wealth; even in India constitution

## STATUS BASED STRATIFICATION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- While class based in based on economic condition, status based stratification is based on prestige, honour, social and cultural capital, personal qualities, education, fame, family etc.
- In traditional societies, it was ascriptive but becoming both ascriptive and achieved in modern societies
    - Status evolves with evolution of society
    - Leads to opening of strata – more dynamic as ascriptive status has to be justified by nobility
- Difference from class
    - Based on social criteria, not economic
    - Aware of the social status, whereas difficult to be aware in class
    - Generally more closed than class, esp when ascriptive
    - Concerned with consumption and not production
- It is more closed and promotes social discrimination and inequality; social groups focused on self interest and restrict others from joining
- **Weber**: 3 factors of stratification
- **Waters**: status is becoming more imp in post industrial societies with rising consumerism
    - Consumption is based on status
- **Frank Parkin** – social closure - don’t allow outsiders to take awards
- **WL Warner** – focus on status with edu, occupation and income
- **Bourdieu** (4 types and identitites shaped more on lifestyle choices) - **An invitation to reflexive sociology**
- Examples of status change: Sanskritization, westernization

## GENDER BASED STRATIFICATION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Aan Oakley**: Gender is a social construct which is a result of discrimination against women.
- Layering of diff genders which shapes their access to income, status and power
- Gender defines life chances
    - Political, education, household
- Gender inequality at workplace
    - 2 types of segregation – horizontal (pink collarization eg – secretary vs police officer seen as masculine job) and vertical – **Karuna Ahmad** – pink collarization
    - Glass escalator is a phenomena to describe invisible uplward movement which puts men in position of power even in female dominated positions
    - Glass wall – exclusion from horizontal mobility. It boxes women into certain roles with large field of employment eg army nurse vs combatant
    - Glass floor – exact opposite of glass ceiling. It refers to exclusion of men from traditional occupations of women like secretary, office, elder care providers
    - Glass cliff
    - 3 types
        - Gender confirms to sex eg – majority people – hetero
        - Gender does not confirm – eg – transman or transwoman or sex change operation (eg **Naaz Joshi** – trans women wins intl beauty sts)
        - Fluid gender – move in a continuum of gender spectrum – eg – Bacha Posh in Afghanistan (ind born as female but socialized by parents as males), hijras (bio men who wear female clothing)
        - **Guy Standing** – feminization of work – coined the term
    - **Karuna Ahmad** – women tend to be restricted to certain types of pink collar jobs
- Patriarchal bargain
    - **Denise Kandiyoti** – it refers to a strategy used by women to manipulate the patriarchal system to her advantage instead of challenging the system
    - It empowers women against social exclusion practiced by men at workplace
    - Eg – assertive role played to show she is strong
- GI in Education
    - STEM by men
    - Edu by men
    - Dropout by girl child
    - ASER – Girls to public school; inv on male edu is inv whereas on women is burden
- GI in politics
    - under representation of women in political positions and almost invisible in top most – **Amartya Sen** missing women
    - sarpanch pati – grassroot level
    - bureaucracy – no female cabinet secy
    - bill 106 Am
    - 15% representation
- Social
    - Son meta preference, missing women, female feticide, violence
- Household
    - women in expressive role, men in instrumental , domestic violence
    - inequal distribution of property, wealth, decision making
    - ration cards – head of household, samp duty
    - UN line
    - **Christine Delphy** – conceptualized household as factory, men as bourgeoise and women proletariat in family – but no fixed role, hours, no pay
    - Family planning, education
    - **Leela Gulati**, **Blood** and **Hamblin** – status doesn’t improve despite employment
    - **Diana Pearce**: women are more deprived and face grunt of poverty
- **Maragret Mead**
    - Arapesh – both in child rearing and both sensitive to each other
    - Mundugmor – both sexes involved in head hunting eg caniballism
    - Tchombulli – reverse gender roles in sexes – men adorn themskeves while women work hard
- Religion: Pati vrata; **Uma Chakobarty** – religion gives low status to women (calls it Brahminical patriarchy)
- **Firestone** – private patriarchy (HH) to public patriarchy (other areas)
- How gender shapes male identity
    - Encourages masculinity
    - Socialization of gender
    - Notion of emotion in family
    - Dol – **Parsons** and **Mudrock** – natural division + functionalists
    - Intersectionality (**Diana Pearce**)
    - Patriarchal mindset
    - Reflexivity – look at themselves as masculine – imp in gender formation
    - Post modernist – **Jacques Derrida**/ **Lacan** – no single grand theory for gender stratification
    - Other theories such as radical feminism (blame men), social feminism (blame capitalism) and liberal feminism (blame culture)
- Positive enhancements for women
    - Abolition of patriarchal rituals
    - Promotion of women education
    - Mechanization leading to reduced household work
    - More employment with automation and more sophisticated jobs
    - Women reservation
    - MNREGA
    - Abolition of female feticide
- But still stratification continues
    - Non-legalization of same sex marriages
    - **Claudia Goldin** study : workforce rise, fall, rise – impact of edu, contraceptive pill, flexible work
    - Environmental impact of climate change more severe on women

## MOBILITY
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Sorokin**: transition of an individual, object or value, which is of human creation, from one position to another
- **Wallace** and **Wallace** – movement of a person or persons from one social position to another
- Reasons for mobility
    - **Parsons**: as roles are filled by people best suited to perform it
    - **Marx**: polarization involves mobility of petite bourgeoise to bourgeoise or proletariat
    - **Frank Parkin** and **Dahrendorf**: Safety valve where built up frustration is settled
    - More common in modern society with focus on education and qualifications; Upward mobility more common as demand for unskilled workers are reducin
    - Examples – Sanskritization, education, migration, urbanization
- Open and closed systems
    - **Sorokin** in his “**socio cultural dynamics**” says no society is is completely closed or open, some kind of fluidity is always present
    - Open system (**Dipankar Gupta**) – a stratification of society which is legitimized on basis of merit and hierarchy is quantifiable in nature (based on merit) eg – class system
    - Closed system – based on differences (qualitative) assume hierarchy is a closed system eg – class, gender, ethnicity, race

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Open|closed|
|- Mobility is encouraged|- Mobility is discouraged|
|- Eg|- eg|
|- at an individual level|- at group level|
|- does not displace already existing elites|- does displace already existing elite – shudras were allowed to sanskritize, not Dalits (**MNS**) , LGBTQ marriage<br>- if mobility – challenge societal norms, displace (**MNS**), redstribute wealth and economic resources|
|- social system maintains equilibrium despite mobility|- May disrupt or develop strain with mobility|
|- Class hierarchy is variable sum game|- Status hierarchies are 0 sum game|
|- Meritocratic society|- Ascriptive society|
- **AB** – open system of stratification is one in which diff components of identity are recombined in diff ways/ diverse ways (asymmetrical nature)
    - Caste 1, class 2, power 3
- **AB** – closed system is one where diff components are combined in the same mobility way (C1, C2, P3)
- Embourgeoisement – working class to middle class – upward vertical mobility – hence open mibolity as prolet become MC
- **Goldthorpe** – Affluent worker – short range and inter-generational
    - Out of 80, only 2 went up
- IHDS – on social mobility – most upper posts upper caste and bottom are lower caste tribes and women
- . Also black coated workers (**Lockwood**) same observations – experienced downward vertical mobility, **Pat Grey** and **Colin Brown** – role of race in social mobility, add gender, caste, reservation, **Bourdieu**
- India: Sanskritization of **MNS**, De-sanskritization by **DN Mazumdar**, **Ashrafization** – **De Steurs** -> mobility in even a closed system, **Globalization** can lead to mobility with diffusion of new ideas, Middle class expands with rising urbanization (**Weber**)), pink collarization
- So no system is absolutely or absolutely closed
- Social mobility implications
    - On person – better life chance, status, relative deprivation, family symmetry and decision making
    - On Society – MC increase, status, rights and movements
- Sources for mobility
    - General sources/ avenues of social mobility
        - Traditional (fewer avenues)
            - Power eg Mauryas
            - Patronage
            - Spirituality
            - Sanskritiazation
            - Trade eg vaishyas
            - Brahmins
            - Expertise eg Chanakya
            - Geo mobility eg Aryans
        - Modern (more) – stratification in new world order
            - Industrialialisation – **Lipset** – high mobility in England (**Lipset Zetterberg thesis**)
            - Education and skilling
            - Occupation change – new jobs like gig economy
            - Envt – good rain/ flood
            - Social movememts like Dalits – increased stata consciousness
            - Law const
            - Migration and rising middle class (**Weber**)
            - Globalization - Emergence of service sector
            - Physical – **Sally Loverman**
            - Tech dev
            - Role of social media
            - Subjective factor- like aspirations and reference group theory -> **Ambedkar**
            - But made stratification more intersectional – with people facing multiple forms of discrimination
    - **Wilkinson** and **Pickett** – **The spirit level** – why equality makes stronger societies – high inequality less social mobility
- Benefits of social mobility
    - **Sorokin** (**Social Mobility**): vertical mobility stairs and elevators and as blood streams in the human body
    - Breaks exclusiveness of social groups
    - Promotes an inclusive society
    - Ensures available opportunity to all
    - Creativity
- Barriers to mobility
    - **Goldthorpe**: European mobility- affluent worker study – extremely low in lower ranks
    - **Ken Roberts**: indicator of meritocratic society as well as stability of class architecture (mobility is low in traditional ascriptive society)
    - **Andre Beteille**: mobility in closed system is difficult (caste, class and power)
    - **Srinivas**: Sanskritization leads to upward mobility, but only culturally and not in a structural aspect
    - **David Glass**: elite self recruitment leads to barrier; only middle and low positions left – this is why lesser downward mobility
    - Other barriers: unequal opportunities, unequal access to resources, class of origin, caste and ethnicity barriers (even told by **Goldthorpe**)
    - **Willmott** and **Youngs** – 83% managing directors in 1970 were sons of professionals and managers
    - **Oscar Lewis**
- Types of mobility
    - On basis of direction - Vertical/ horizontal
        - **Anthony Giddens**: great dela of horizontal mobility in modern society
        - Eg – nurse, downward such as layoffs
        ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 63.png>)
    - On speed - Inter generational vs intra generational
        - **Blau** and **Duncan** – influenced by edu, nature of first job and father occupation
    - Structural vs individual
        - SM – based due to change in social stratification itself
        - Eg – oil discovery, dominant caste by **MNS**, eg cotton mill workers downward mobility after shutdown of mills
    - Absolute vs relative
        - Relative means if one moves up, other comes down
        - Absolute – how much have living standards improved or decreased and for what percentage of people
    - Sponsored or contested mobility ie – sponsored on basis of policy eg reservation
        - Contested on basis of open competition
- Impact of social mobility
    - Cons: anomie, nuclearization, stress, use scams/ shortcuts
    - Divorce, loneliness and suicide -> Kota suicides
- Social closure is the voluntary exclusion of a group from another group in society
- Can be dtatus, political, economic (eg pvt schools), women (pink collarization)
- Middle class faces dual closure
- Cane reference group closure
- Self defeating prophecy
- Inter-sectional approach to SS – society is universally stratified and mobility between groups is dependended on nature, form, org of societal structure
- Mobility examples
    - Race – black lives matter, israel hamas war
    - Caste – suicides, Yadavs, drapudai murmu
    - Gender – leena nair, goldin, women reservation bill
    - Ethnicity – rishi suak, sundar pichai
    - Class – elon musk, reservations
    - Only 21% female ias officers

## - CHAPTER 6

## WORK
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Usage of physical and mental effort for production of goods and services that cater to human needs
- In eco sociology, it means activity which results in paid employment, reward or contract
- But can include unpaid work also
- Domestic division of labour also – so obligatory work also
- **Marx**: first sociologist to examine work in factories. He identified concepts of alienation and de-skilling
- **Weber**: new authority with new bureaucratic orgs of work
- **Durkheim** – DOL strengthens organic solidarity due to increased moral density. Rapid change in society however can lead to normlessness, which he called is an anomie
- Importance of work
    - Source of income
    - Influences all other aspects of society, esp class and gender based stratification and social mobility
    - Promotes creativity and constructive critical thinking for problem solving
    - Helps in building social capital by new contracts and relations
    - Affects status (**Warner**)
    - Personal identity and growth of “I”
- Worker vs labor
    - Worker is someone not in a managerial position
    - But also has voluntary choice of work unlike labor who is forced to work due to lack of choice for any reason
    - Workers have different skills and manage different portfolios based on requirement
- New ways of working
    - Flexible production model
    - Virtual production model after COVID
    - Tech advancement is directly related to alienation
        - **Blauner**: higher use of tech leads to alienation
        - **Frank Hull** (**the effect of tech on alienation from work**): more negatively linear than curvilinear
    - Entrepreneurship
    - Automation and mechanization
    - Use of AI and ML

## WORK IN DIFFERENT SOCIETIES
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Formal work to perform task efficiently

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Work in industrial time|Post industrial|Gig economy|
|- - Standardized, mass production<br>    - Repetitive<br>    - Impersonal<br>    - Physical<br>    - No scope for creativity|- - Customized + scope of creativity<br>    - Mcd vs IBM<br>    - Knowledge or intellectual work<br>    - Not physical – mental labor<br>    - Need not be repetitive<br>    - Fragmented<br>    - Team based concept of work|- - Taskficication – **Srineck**<br>    - Repetitive<br>    - Can be physical or mental<br>    - May be monotonous<br>    - Not necessarily standardized<br>    - Individual targets|
|- - To oversee this nature of work, pyramidal organization/ rigid|- - Flatter bureaucracy<br>    - **Burns** and **Stalker** – organic model<br>    - Toyotism|- - Holocracy – most decentralized|
|- - **Weber** iron cage|   |   |
|- - Machine bureaucracy , mechanized model (**Burns** and **Stalkers**)<br>    - **Henry Mintzberg**<br>    - taylor|   |   |
- 1911 – **Taylorism** developed
    - It is a scientific theory of work mgt which considers work as a science
    - Steps suggested by **Taylor**
        - Conduct time ( Break work and assess time) and motion studies (break work and assess his movement) – quantification of time to compute the time taken by worker using timer. Also includes studying motion of worker while completing task – includes movement of body and limbs
        - DOL – break work into specialized components and allocate work to specialized worker
        - Monitoring – performance to be monitored supervised by managers
        - Scientific selection of workers on merit
        - Incentivize workers - Mgt should provide incentives for workers to complete the job quickly and punish inefficnet workers
    - Efficiency, calculative, standardization, control over workers – all lead to rationalization of work place
    - Demerits – **reduces worker to economic man** (only concerned about how quickly completely task than how he felt doing it), cog in machine, alienated, replaceable by machine , reduce bargaining power of workers, de-skilling of worker (**Braverman**)
    - **Taylorism** in post industrial society – emotional work (**managed heart** – **Arlie Hoschild**)
        - Refers to app of scientific mgt to digital era – applicable to knowledge workers and service workers
        - Involves tech to monitor and optimize worker productivity, smart sensor, vc record, AI chatbot, automation, biometric, panoptical
    - Eg – amazon
- **Henry Ford** – used scientific in automobile – specialized machines to boost economies of scale + increment of min wage to increase mass consumption
    - Mass prod, cons, long term commitment to worker, productivity linked wage, collective bargaining agreement
- **Elton Mayo** – **Mayoism** – Human resource theory – **Mayo** believed we should treat worker as employee and move beyond concept of economic man. They cant be productive if they arent emotionally invested
    - This simply meant that employees were given chance to get involved in managerial tasks too and managers took their advice
    - **Mayo** recognized employees will form informal networks – and this shouldn’t be discouraged
- Toyotism - in Japan, employees hired in a group and not individually
    - These groups were made to compete against each other
    - Employees were given lifetime social security
    - Bottom up decision making – participation mgt through quality circles
- Work can have different structures at different times; even at same time (capitalism vs Asiatic mode of working)

- Contemporary relevance
    - New ways of work emerging
    - Work also dependent on cultural aspects as per **Weber’s** protestant ethic theory (eg – tribals)
    - **Blau** – based on technical
    - WFH emerging – so increasing JF
    - Customization and creativity
    - Also affected by political scenario and geography of work – spatial variation
    - **Charles Handy** – empty raincoat – workers need to have diverse skills for portfolio mgt
    - **Taylorism** and **Fordism** (but only in mfg industries with std prod) -> higher alienation, low trust system
    - Post **Fordism** – customization demanded and hence moving ahead to creativity
    - **Bonacich** and **Appelbaun** -> race to bottom where cos will pay lowest wages to beat comp
    - bamboo ceiling – Asians limited to some posts only
    - all service sector points
- For service industry
    - characteristics
        - In post 1991 era
        - Extensive use of digital and telecommunication
        - Middle class
        - **Burnham** – managerial evolution
        - Flexibility – **Handy** and empty raincoat
        - **Taylorism** in post industrial society – gamification and use of digital tech
        - Rise of gig economy
        - Flexible working models
    - Benefits
        - Education and skilling
        - Feminization
        - Dilution of caste based and other stratification
        - Social mobility
        - Social identity + financial indepdendence -> improved status (**Warner**)
    - Challenges
        - **Blauner** and **CW Mills** - Alienation
        - **Arlie Hochschild** – managed heart
        - Dual shift + **Leela Gulati**
        - Informalization
        - migration
        - Gender pay wage gap – **Sylvia Walby**
    - Hence, informal sector is like people in the waiting room, trying to seek mobility, which is available only to a few
    - Surveillance capitalism
- Formal – informal organization of work
    - **Formal organisation**: is a highly structured secondary group deliberately created to achieve goals in the most efficient manner. The modern bureaucratic organisations, characterized by an authority, hierarchy, a clear division of labor, written rules and impersonality, are prime example of formal organisations. Examples are colleges, corporations, government agencies, and hospitals.
        - Well defined roles
        - Coordination
        - Limitation on activities of people
        - Scalar chain

        - Structuralist school – need low cost labor for competitiveness (eg in global and regional value chains)
    - Solution
        - Formalization of informal sector – e-shram (BUT **Blau** – informal even within formal)

## CHAPTER 7

## POWER
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Weber** (**economy and society**): Ability of individuals or groups to influence others to carry out their will, in a communal action, even against will of others who are participating in the social action
    - **Economy and society**
    - Domination used to study history – domination is chance of man to get his command obeyed
    - Types
    - Zero sum game
    - Power in a system is constant and hence limited in quantum
    - Authority is the form of power which is legitimate
    - One exercises power at the expense of other
    - Traditional, charisma, rational legal
    - **Paul Du Gay**, Bureaucracy has unmatched ethos which include equal treatment of all despite different race, colour or caste
- Functional view: power is possessed by society and not individuals, where some social positions are more important than others and exercise power through them
    - **Parsons** –
        - Located in G of **AGIL**
        - Individuals deposit power in political leader just like they deposit it in bank
        - Leaders in return deliver infra, growth which caters collectively to members
        - Egs – universalization of edu, 100% sanitation
        - If collective goals are realized, systemic power increase, else decline
        - Function of power is to fulfill collective goals and maintain equilibrium
        - "Power is not a zero-sum game". Discuss with reference to **Weber's** and **Parsons's** views. **(2014/I/6a/20)**
- **Marx**: of
    - State represents interests of capitalists
    - Power is concentrated in the hands of the dominant group (the haves) used for exploitation of have nots
    - Suggested making a political party of workers
    - Source of power is the economic infrastructure
    - Zero sum
    - Have nots are exploited when they have false consciousness
    - Only when there is collective ownership on means of production, power will go back to people
    - Evidence to support Marxism
        - Effects of decisions – concentration of power in the hand of a few capitalists who then monopolize power in society
        - Concessions to working class
        - Non decision making – **John Urry** criticizes **Dahl** that only those issues come up which are defined by bourgeoise and only safe decisions taken. SOME HAVE THE POWER TO PREVENT DECISION
    - Critique
        - Couldn’t explain why states became stronger
        - Do not account other sources of power other than wealth
        - Couldn’t explain why some states could uplift entire population
        - Trickle down effect of economic growth, who benefit from rising standards
- Elite theories: Classical elite and pluralist elite theories
- **French** and **Raven**: 5 basis of power - clerr
    - Expert: possession of knowledge and skills makes them valued
    - Legitimate: make demand and get obedience of demand formally
    - Referent: person’s attributes which make them attractive
    - Coercive: authority from fear of force
    - Reward : can reward/ compensate for compliance of rules, targets etc.
- **Gene Sharp**: power lies with obedience of subjects (eg overthrow of power)
- **Amos Hawley**: every social act is existence of power, every social relation is a power equation and every social group is org of power
- Features of power
    - Creates structure of society – powerful or powerless
    - Leads to stratification
    - Manifest itself In social relations eg man and follower
    - Reciprocal but not equal
- **Bottomore** – political inst are concerned with division of power in society

## CLASSICAL ELITE
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Society is divided into 2 main groups – ruling minority and ruled majority; egalitarian society like democracy is a myth/ utopia
- Ruling minority has physical and psychological attributes which are basis of power
- **Pareto**:
    - **Mind and society**
    - power is possessed by few due to their physical psychological qualities and **these qualities remain the same at all times**
        - 2 types : governing : play direct or indirect role and non-governing elites
        - Non govt**- such as economic (wealth), sports, art, ethic (virtuous)**
    - these qualities divided ruler and ruled
    - elite refer to those who excel
    - two groups of governing elite: lions and foxes (<
    - lions rule by force, courage, decisive
    - foxes by cunningness and have manipulation skills
    - Dictators/ royals/ conservative fall in lions
    - Innovative/ materialistic goal/ imaginative cunning people like Chanakya and Maurya fall in foxes
    - Circulation: when one set decays or loses vigour, replaced by other set of elites ; can be 2 types – gov and non-gov, or lions and foxes
    - Due to loss of faith, corrupt, loss of transperacy
    - Circulation not ltd to politics – seen in religious groups, biz also eg startup vs capitalist
    - Borrowed from **Machiavelli**
    - Each kind of elite lacks the qualities of the counterpart
    - Masses lack rational capacity and hence are dominated – since they don’t have rational capacity, its less likely that there will be a revolution
    - Circulation of Elites leads to social change in society.
    - Criticism
        - **Parsons** Criticism : no distinction between democracy, communism, fascism etc
        - No way of measuring qualities
        - Difference between lion and fox is merely style of rule
        - Altruism -people do charity not for power
        - Modern society is complex and there are multiple sources of power centres
        - **Bottomore**: “**Elites and society**” elite circulation may not always be there as revolutionary intellectuals exist
        - DIFFERENT types of rules – no difference
        - **CW Mills**
        - Pluralist theory
        - In response to Marxist claim that class struggle will lead to an egalitarian society with no private ownership
        - History is never ending circulation of elites
        - **Karl Mannheim**: In a democracy, there are various pulls and pushes that shape policy; people remove if they are not satisfied
        - **Justifies inequality and restricts social mobility**
    - **Relevance today**
        - **Economic inequality observed**
        - **Highly relevant in 2 party democracies like USA**
        - **Globalization – IMF WB show circulation on global scale**
- **Mosca**
    - **The Ruling class**
    - Better organizational skills
    - A few who dominate and others who are dominated and is inevitable
    - Agreed that there a few who dominate, but qualities are not the same all the time and vary from society to society and time to time
    - There are socialical and personal factors affecting rule
    - Democracy actually reflects the concerns of the elite and masses are a group of passive unconcerned people
    - Ruler can be elite (political or property) or semi-elite (like managers)
    - Elites are constrained by social factors and hence rules are not completely powerless in a democracy
- **Robert Michels** – developed ILOO to explain why masses cannot rule over society even in democratic states or socialist parties – there is tendency of tiny organized minority elites
    - Oligarchy – concentration of power with few minority elite
    - Iron law – tendency of an org to develop tiny organized elite in any organisation
    - few dominate power
    - Because they have access to information
    - Limited accountability
    - Elite rule is inevitable in society as it is a technical and tactical necessity
    - Iron law of oligarchy
    - Decisions in democracy are taken by the few elite who possess power and hence rule is inevitable
    - People are not rational – hence ruled
    - Though **Mosca** agrees that elites can be drawn from public and wide background
    - Features
        - Concentration of power eg – despotism by dynastic rule
        - Lower mass participation eg voter turnout
        - Low trust of people eg farmer bill
        - Conservative nature
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 64.png>)
    - Criticism
        - **Robert Dahl** – in **Democracy and Its Critics**, - reduced entire democracy to oligarchy
- **CW Mills**:
    - **The power elite**
    - Elite rule is inevitable and a small group of elite exrcised **disproportionate amount of power**
    - So, key people in key institutes is power elites
    - According to his US study, power lies with institutions and not personal qualities of individuals or psychological
    - Doesn’t mean they don’t use psychological but primary source is institution
    - Certain institutions occupy pivotal positions and the elite comprise those who “**command post**” in these institutions and monopolize power
    - He called this power elite – which consists of military, federal govt and corporations
    - Cohesiveness is strengthened by the fact that they often have similar social background and interests and frequent exchanges with each other as well as engage amongst themselves
        - Eg – ivy leagure, men, white, US
        - Endogamous, social closure
        - Global influence
        - Have unlimited power to manipulate masses - manipulate to justify work in own interest
        - A lot of power and limited accountability
    - Big corporations have these elite in boardrooms eg WWII
    - Minority of power elite
    - Elite Self recruitment
    - Significance
        - Central govt makes policy for eco growth
        ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 65.png>)Corporate make tools and tech to drive growth
        - Military protects attack
    - Relevance – **Sanjay Baru** + Ambanis
    - Criticism – **Dahl** + only American
    - Supported by **Floyd Hunter** – community power structure
- **James Burnham**: managerial revolution with dispersion of power in form of shares; control is passed on to a few managerial positions
- **Sanjay Baru** – India’s power elite – 3 key institutions
    - Congress, caste, regional
    - Vernacular or regional from low caste and non congress front coming to power elite
- **Badri Narayan** – bihar – 1948 – 1980s -2000 :
    - 1948: hegemony of kayasthas, brahmins, bhumihars (congress)
    - 1980s – Kurmi, koeri, Yadav (non congress)
    - 2000s – Dalit politics – chamars -> penetration of power to lower
    - At surface looks democratization since 50s, however, one set of elite replaced by another committee
- **Robert Dahl**: **CW Mills** has circumstantial evidence; power is disprersed – who governs? Interest groups
- **Dahl** – they work for welfare of people
- **Arnold Rose**: Elite groups don’t go hand in glove like **Mills** said. They take the decisions in consultation with various interest groups
- Public opinion matters
- **Karl Mannheim**: In a democracy, there are various pulls and pushes that shape policy; people remove if they are not satisfied
- **Thompson** – they don’t take decisions all on own but have to give concessions
- Common features of classical elite theory
    - Ruling minority, ruled majority
    - Masses are not rational and hence unaware
    - Self recruitment and system closure
    - Work for own self interests
    - Take decisions for society eg Hiroshima nagaski
    - Power is concentrated
    - Power is zero sum game
    - They are v selfish and aim to fulfil own self interest
- **Differences between Pareto and MILLS:**
    - **Nature of Elite**:
        - **Mills'** power elite consists of a triad of political, economic, and military leaders collaborating for
        shared interests.
        - **Pareto** emphasizes the natural and cyclical nature of elites, with different groups rising to power over
        time.
        - **Mosca** focuses on the political class as the dominant elite, emphasizing the control of political
        institutions.
    - **Interconnectedness:**
        - **Mills** emphasizes the interconnectedness of institutions, with the power elite operating across
        various sectors.
        - **Pareto** and **Mosca** focus more on the rotation of elites and the dominance of specific groups in
        particular spheres.
    - **Elitist Circulation:**
        - While **Pareto** and **Mosca** highlight the circulation of elites, **Mills'** concept of the power elite suggests
        a more stable and interconnected group.
    - **Sources of Power:**
        - **Mills**: Power is concentrated in the triad of political, economic, and military institutions, with
        collaboration among these sectors. The power elite controls major societal decisions.
        - **Pareto**: Elites are characterized by those with superior abilities, whether intellectual, economic, or
        political. Power may be held by those who excel in different spheres, and the elite naturally changes
        over time.
        - **Mosca**: Power is concentrated in the political class, and the ruling minority emerges through
        competition and the ability to manipulate political institutions.
    - **Role of Ideas and Values:**
        - **Mills**: Emphasizes the role of shared values and ideas among the power elite in maintaining their
        dominance. The elite class has a cohesive worldview that guides decision-making.
        - **Pareto**: Focuses on the circulation of elites based on their abilities and the emergence of new elites
        with different values and ideas over time.
        - **Mosca**: Highlights the manipulation of ideas and ideologies by the political class to maintain control.
        The ruling minority uses ideologies to justify its dominance.
    - **Social Mobility:**
        - **Mills**: The power elite remains relatively stable, with limited social mobility. The interconnectedness
        of the elite class reinforces its stability.
        - **Pareto**: Recognizes the circulation of elites, suggesting that social mobility occurs as different groups

    - Reject idea of public holds power; instead bystander and interests represented by interest groups
    - Since multiple interest groups co-exist, cant say one superior to another
    - **Raymond Aron**: “govt becomes business of compromise” ; acts as a honest broker between different elite groups. Govt can never satisfy everyone all the time
    - Eg – teacher grup, students union; farmer, corporate ; envt capitalist, lawyer, doctor
    - **Robert Dahl** (**Who governs**): elite theory confuses potential and actual power; local politics is a business of negotiating and bargaining – supported this classical pluralism
    - Uunlike classical pluralism, not all groups equally imp – some more imp ; believe state works in interest of elite interest groups
- Power is not concentrated with one but dispersed; modern democracies have different sources of power
- They don’t reject that elites exist, but say there are other sources of power like pressure groups, trade unions etc.
- Hence, elitism is compatible with democracy
- Diverse occupations lead to different groups, who bargain and negotiate to influence and shape policies – no one plays a dominant role as conflicting interests amongst different groups

## POST MODENISTS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Focault** – relation between Power and knowledge” - media
    - Knowledge is power –
        - power not possessed by people but people possed by
        - power those who have new knowledge or exclusive knowledge have power eg aadhar knowledge + knowledge keeps increasing
        - certain group create knowledge like academicians, scientist men and rest are subject to discourse by these people
        - Discourse theory says our symbols, comm and thoughts are influenced by those in power
        - They can influence what we think is true or not
    - This involves dev of discourse – eg doctor wins in discourse – discourse is discussion or narrative on topic
    - **Madness and civilization** – discourse is practice that systematically forms the objects of which they speak. mental illness emerged by psychiatrists
    - **Discipline and Punish** – as reformist intention increased by 19th century, focus on people become judged for what they were instead of what they did (eg call a thief)
        - Experts emerged – eg juvenile justice board
        - Focus was on intention of the criminal
        - power is exercised and not possessed and hence there is always uncertainty if it can be exercised or not
        - power can be reversed as you can get counter diagnosis (2nd opinion of doctor)
        - Panopticon – the fear of surveillance makes people behave better (Eg God or jailor)
        - belief was humans have souls and can be manipulated
- **Antonio Gramsci**

        - Divided society into 2 groups = political society (army, police, legal system) and civil society (church, trade union, mass media, pol parties)
        - If ruling class maintained control by approval of the members of society, it created hegemony. However, it could remain hegemonistic only if it was ready to compromise and take account of demands of exploited class
        - No complete hegemony as
            - Noth ruling class and subject divided amongst themselves and hence no single group on its own could maintain dominance
            - State wanted to make concessions to subjects
            - For overthrowing of capitalism, intellectuals need to emerge within subject class to mould ideas and form historic block of exploited
- **Steven Lukes**- 3 faces of power

                - Structural conduciveness – envt of society should be such that certain forms of protest can take place eg not monarch
                - Structural strain - which should be due to the structure of current social system – relative deprivation due to inequality eg caste system
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 72.png>)

            - if it can muster resources like leadership, comm and funding, they can be more effective
            - assumption is resources are scarce and they have to compete for it
            - criticism: doesn’t explain movements by farmers and peasants , new movements don’t need resources eg meTOO, arab spring – no resource
        - **political opportunity theory (Till** and **McAdam**)**

        - Analyzed religion a s asource of social change rather than domination as per Marxists
        - Their desire to succeed, helped intiate industrial dev and capitalism
    - **Peter Berger** (**Nomos cosmos**) – relations provides norms of religion to appeal to cosmos (supernatural)
        - Everyone is born with an empty mind and injected with values and cultures
        - This refers to nomos – a part of culture and inherited by individuals by socialization
        - Conformance to nomos leads to universality of meaning of religion
- Animism
- Monism
    - Belief in single ideology – belief in oneness of everything – Advaita , vishisht advaita
    - Preached by **Plotinus** and **Adi Shankara** + in bhakti movement
    - Hindusim: advaita
    - Islam – only one Allah and denies existence of all other religions
    - **Tyler**: function of modern society
- Pluralism
    - Multiple faiths exist in one society

    - Different from **syncretism, where different beliefs come together to make one output**
    - Eg – Hindusim shivaite, vaishnavite etc), christianity
    - **Peter Berger**: “**Social reality of religion**”
        - Cosmos may not always be considered sacred, and hence there is an attempt to secularize cosmos
        - Links modernization and secularism : as modernization increases, more ideas emerge, so religion weakens

### CRITICISM
- **Stark** and **Bainbridge**: contradicts’ people have more options as American society, religion is becoming stronger
- Can also conflicts

## SECTS AND CULTS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Sects
    - **Troletsch** and **Bruce** – sect as an exclusive group cut off from the mainstream religions due to multiple reasons
        - Difference over leadership
        - Over belief
        - Over practices
    - Features
        - Closely knit society
        - Demand high commitment from members
        - Openly in tension with dominant religion unlike cult (**Peter Berger**) - small and closed has different beliefs from the dominant religion
        - Usually a charismatic authority
        - Attempt to rationalize the dominant religion
    - Reasons
- external
    - Possible response to **relative deprivation; they feel disenchanted, alienated and marginalized from main society (Troletsch)**
    - Some people find Church orthodox, rigid, impersonal, discriminatory or corrupt (eg – brahmin domination)
    ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 76.png>)Feature od modernization and secularization
    - **THEODICY OF Disprivilege**” where theodicy means religious explanation (when marginalized stand up against religious explanation which justifies their marginalization and that they will be rewarded in afterlife for their suffering on earth) ; sects provide an alternative path of redemption
    - Eg – dalit and mausmriti burning -> Jainism
    - **Bryan Wilson**: methodism is a response to new working class and the uncertainity of the newly settled industrial area
    - **Steve Bruce** – as a result of rationalization, secularization, social differentiation
    - **Roy Wallis**: defined sect as a **deviant group** that sees themselves as uniquely legitimate
- Internal
    - People seek salvation in a sense of community offered
    - **Reinhold Niebuhr**: can be short lived or convert to dominant or full fledged religion
    - Hence, seek remedy, come as contradiction, create a counter culture, promote alternate ideology
    - But now not necessarly an economic phenomena – eg ISKCON
    - Eg – Calvinism, Jainism, Sikhism
    - Can add secularization critique – **Stark** and **Bainbridge** + **Peter Berger**
- Cults
    - The word cult has negative connotations in common sense with bizarre practices. But all religions were cults. Now use new religious movements used
    - It is a type of religion which is believed to be established around a charismatic leader believed to possess extraordinary qualities
    - Types of cults (**ACC**) – **Roy Wallis**
        - World rejecting – they see outside world as inherently evil and reject mainstream world and encourage followers to detach themselves from mainstream. Eg – people’s temple by **Jim Jones**, heavens gate, **Osho**
        - World accommodating – unlike world rejecting, don’t reject mainstream and unlike affirming, not obsessed with max potential of individuals eg brahm kumari
        - World affirming – they don’t reject mainstream material world, rather show how to extract max by unlocking potential. They promote enjoy life and make them better individuals. More like paid enlightenment similar to SHG eg vipassana, scientology
    - Another – **Stark** and **Bainbridge**
        - Audience cults: least organized – little F2F interaction and passively engaged eg – books, lectures – Sadhguru
        - Client cults: more organized, and ongoing relationship between leaders and followers – more like adherents
        - Cult movements: satisfy all religious needs of followers
        - Satisfy needs of alienated sections of urban middle class youth
        - Is v transitory and irregular
        - Hence have different cult memberships ( can follow more than 1)
        - More in western society, after post war and created counter culture as they are materialistic but anxious
    - Reasons for new cults
        - Provides sense of belongingness – this appeals to individuals who feel isolated or disconnected
        - Quick salvation – rapid solution to everyday life problem; Cults provide relief in current life itself, vs religion which provides relief in afterlife
        - Provides flexibility
        - Heterogeneity
        - Personalized services and highly accessible
        - To deal with inequalities – women/ lower caste
        - Social media influence
    - So these are voluntary orgs in metropolitans to ease the sufferings in industrial societies
    - Usually under a charismatic leader, with focus on individual experiences
    - Trying to find man ki shanti; not really marginalized
    - Usually a richer person – important clients
    - V individualistic
    - No ceoncept of membership or exclusivity
    - **Steve Bruce** – result of secularization
    - **Stark** and **Bainbridge**: new religions or atleast new in a particular society
        - Something may be cult in one place but a religion in another eg ISCON
    - Reasons for cult
        - Conflict in traditional modern society
        - Insecurity – both psychological and social
        - Inequality – rising inequality
        - Change – rapidly changing society, need some anchor in this change for peace
        - Free lunches: offered by sects (schools, hospitals)
        - Political patronage: offered owing to populist politics
    - Denomination
        - When sect becomes more organized and institutionalized with larger following, it becomes a Denomination
        - Denomination is more acceptable in eyes of the church
        - **Johnson**: The line between church and denomination is not v clear, nor is the line between sect and cult is
        - Denomination has its own institution, following, ideaoligy and exists in parallel to church ; making it the base of a secular society
        - **Howard Beckar**: a denomination is a sect which has cooled down and become an institutionalized body rather than an active protest group
        - They lose their radicalism and dynamism
        - Attract people from all stratas (not just marginalized) and are usually in line with norms of society
    - Church: established institution which generally accepts the norms of society and consider itself the guardian of social order
    - **ROY WALLIS DIAGRAM**
- **Difference between sect and cult**
    - **In opposition to church eg- protestnt vs in linde eg – Calvinist**
    - **Closed open**
    - **Challenge domination eg jain**
    - **Use forceful conversion vs social media**
    - **Live vs with die with leader**

    - Based on Experimentation vs based on faith value
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 82.png>)
- Precise vs abstract/ metaphysical
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 83.png>)
- Application : concrete vs no immediate results
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 84.png>)
- Universalism: mostly universally valid v variations in ideologies and religions

- **Sorokin**: Religion is based on unquestionable faith but science is based on questionable thesis
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 89.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 90.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 91.png>)
- Religion is also moral and tells right wrong
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 92.png>)
- Positivists, **Weber**, **Marx**: soceities will evolove from theological to rational (**August Comte**)
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 93.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 94.png>)
- **Weber** and **Marx**: as rationality and scientific thoughts increase, secularism ncreases and space for religion decreases
- Inter-dependence
    - Religion using science to grow – NRMs
    - Religion provides science with end goals
    - **Stephen Gould**: Religion gives meaning while science gives rationality (calls its NOMA – non overlapping magisterial principle)
    - Science is marked by uncertainty while religion gives sanction to the doubt eg puja of mercedes
    - Causality: Religious beliefs can give rise to rationality (**Weber** in PE)
    - Complementarity – religion can help where science fails (Dawa nhi dua bacha sakti hai)
    - science will take over; but now, both increasing in different forms
    - **Steve Bruce** – both religion and science can go hand in hand and they are not anti to each other
    - **Philip Hefner** - both religion and science have been destabilized and none can explain absolute reality
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1.jpeg>)
- LOOK A STAR ANSWER
- Science is a systematic body of certified and changing knowledge based on observable facts and methods used to acquire the knowledge
- **Ogburn** and **Nimkoff**: cultural lag theory
    - Material and non-material culture
    - Change in Material culture predates non-material culture
    - Science and tech change leads to non material culture
    - Chain effect
    - Eg - ?
- Population demography change leads to change in technology change and adoption
- Gender equality and technology – easier for women participation; tech leads to gender equality
- Education seen as investment
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 95.png>)

## SECULARIZATION
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **Bryon Wilson** – sec is process characteristised by decline of **significance of religious beliefs and practices** in **public life** – “**desaclerization of society**”
- It is an ongoing or continuous process
- Some observations
    - City dwellers less religious, village dwellers more religious
    - Men less, women more
    - Employed in factory, less religious R, unemployed – more less R
- In line with **Comte**
- Levels of secularization by **Karel Dobbelaere**
    - Macro : religion losing significance at level of state, economy, edu – eg secularism
    - Meso : religious orgs mrore focused on public issues, not other world issues eg langar, school;
        - Hatching, matching, dispatching roles on decline – but case, religion still exists
    - Micro : decline of **collective beliefs** (Hinduism – polygamy, Triple talaq, untouchability)emergence of pvt belief, decline of church attendance (<
    - **Dobbelaere** suggests secularization varies at diff rates in diff levels
- **Weber** - the rationalization of society led to the disenchantment of society and as a result religious motives for action were replaced by rational motives for action
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 96.png>)
- Process: Theological - secularization – secular society
- Transformation of society from a closed identification of religious values and institutions to non-religious values
- Features
    - Decrease in >popularity of religion
    - Rationality -> humans find scientific solutions
    - Science
- Reasons > edu, westernaization, equality, science, industrialization, urbanization. Social movements
- Evaluation: complex sociological concept and there is little consensus on what secularization is and how to measure it?
- Parameters for assessing secularization
    - **Page 238**
- **Bryan Wilson**: secularization is happening in western societies but there is no adequate way to measure the strength of religious commitment
- **David Marton**: Secularization includes a large number of discrete separate elements loosely put together in an intellectual hold all
- Critique
    - Definition of religion is not unanimously agreed – hence decline is difficult
    - Scale to measure decline is not objectively agreed – reliability and validity issues
    - **Luckman** and **Berger** (**the invisible religion**) – Invisible religion - as individualism is increasing, religion becomes are more in person affair rather than collective affair. People are inherently religious and hence, low attendance doesn’t mean secularism
        - Experiencing resacralization and pluralism (similar to **Durkheim** and **Stark**)
    - Emergence of NRMs
    - Religious conflicts – **Samuel Huntington**– clash of civilizations – as economies come closer, interaction increases leading to a rise in fundamentalism
    - Role during hatching, matching, dispatching
    - Communal elections and associations
    - **Kaufman** and **Davie** – while # in church has decreased, # of followers hasn’t
    - **Relevance**
        - **for India –** brahmo samaj – focus on humanism and arya samaj – social issues
        - Caste politics (Ayodhya)
        - Israel hamas war
        - Rise of civic religion – diff from traditional religion and this is his belief, duty, ritual towards the state to meet political objectives (**Robert Bellah** in **New religious consciousness and crisis of modernity**)
            - **Civic religion emerging as a new form of religion where nation symbols accorded same respect and faith as religion**
            - Drive participation in war, voting etc
            - Perputated by national festivals and rituals
    - Indianization of rationality – eg guru for mining

## REVIVALISM
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS

- Forms
    - Fundamentalism
    - Increasing Orgs like NRMs
    - Fall of atheism – secular fail in US
    - Religious conversions – MARRIAGE OR ATROCITY EG TRIBES CHRISTIAN
    - Protests and movements around religious symbols – movements like construction of mosques and temples
- Functions

- Challenges posed by religious revivalism in a secular state
    - Restrict personal rights and liberties of **Voltaire**, **Locke** and **Rousseau**
    - Re-enforce pariarchy – reduce equality (**Sylvia Walby**)
    - Deters separation of state from religion
    - Communal clashes and fundamentalism
    - Change in education
    - Destruction of symbols of authority
- Antithesis to **Comte** and other theories which claim religion will end with positivism
- **Secularization is a feature of some societies**; not for all – it’s a matter of degree
- **David Martin**: taking a wider view of secularization
    - He says role of religion is changing in post modern society; which shows revivalism
    - Little trend towards secularization
- **Jose Casanova**: religious beliefs are not dying but coming back in public sphere; in new and unfamiliar forms
- Relevance today
- **Turner** – religion is not only a cognitive system but a meaningful experience
- Communalism
    - Political hegemony of certain social groups to get power and influence policy
    - Majoritarianism to coerce minority sections for adoption of lifestyle creatig resentment
    - Relative deprivation and poverty amongst certain religions
    - Cults and charismatic personalities mobilizing masses

## FUNDAMENTALISM
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- Conservative religious doctrine opposing modern value system in favor of restoring religious values
- Features
    - Literal interpretation of religious texts
    - Againt pluralism
    - Charismatic leadership - **TN Madan** eg - Eg skih movement by Bhindrawalla
    - Highly monistic philosophy
    - Against modern values of FR, gender, scientific theories such as **Marx**, **Darwin**
    - Consider themselves guardians of religion
    - Use of modern tech like youtube
    - Endirse conservative political goals
    - Try to get political and edu power to bring change
- Is a revivalist philosophy that develops more during episodes of modernization
- Types
    - Religious fundamentalism
        - Christian fundamentalism – perceived moral crisis and need to go back to fundamentals for welfare of society
        - Islamic fundamentalism: attacks for power struggle and religion dominance; can lead to terrorist groups and attacks
    - Secular fundamentalism – **Grace Davie** – F not limited to religion. Rigid adherence to non religious beliefs may have common beliefs with religious fundamentalism eg
        - Sexual -strong enforcement of hetero beleifs
        - Economic - strong enforcement of one indicator of measuring development eg GDP for growth
        - Gender – strong enforcement of gender beliefs on diff sexes
        - Political - only one way to make policy – fascism , Nazism
- Trends – Israel, Khalistan
- Reasons
    - Claim to protectors of religion against from external threats eg – Afghanistan/ Myanmar against rohngyas perceived threat to buddhist majority
    - High modernity and globalization responsible - **Anthony Giddens**
        - Modernity: diff lifestyles for everything and undermines traditional religious values
        - Hence, fundamentalists attract people to live a simple basic life in this complex world to go back to calmer period
    - Avoid anxiety as **Secularists** didn’t talk anything about religion even when people wanted to hear it; hence fundamentalists emerged to fill vacuum
    - Provides identity and sense of collective conscience: Identity loss, alientation, commoner, rootlessness - Clutch on to any common support eg RSS
    - **Steve Bruce** – Infallibility and literal interpretation of single sacred test. Low scope for varied interpretation and hence strong ideological cohesion eg -Taliban
    - Prescribe a way of life, confirming a happy and better age that will bring happiness and motivate commitment from followers
    - Role of social media in faster mobilization for movement – fundamentalist movements are usually of collective character, usually under a charismatic leader
    - Politicization of religion - **Almond et.al** – Fundemanetalists work to gain political power by undoing erosion of religious values by globalization ad modernity
- Need to balance between religious fundamentalism and society welfare; secularism has not won yet

## KINSHIP

## FAMILY AND FUNCTIONS
### PRO THINKERS/ POINTS
- **George Murdock** (**social structure**): (in 250 societies – both traditional and industrial)
    - Family is a universal social institution as it existed in all kinds of societies from hunting gathering to industrial societies characterized by …
    - Characteristics: common residence, economic cooperation and reproduction, adults of both sexes, atleast two of whom maintain a socially approved sexual relationship and one or more children, born or adopted, of the sexually cohabiting adults
    - Universal functions – 4
- Some variations may exist: black fams in US don’t have black males/ Nayars of Kerala, LGBTQ
- Family, marriage, household are basic units of society and form the foundation of a society
- Origin and functions
    - Evolution theory ->
        - **Frazer** - Man lived alone in a cave and had promiscuous behavior so didn’t have a family
    - Feminist –
        - Fam is patriarchal to keep women subordinate to men. Legitimates gender inequality since childhood
        - Limits women to domestic role (Expressive role)
        - **Fran Ansley** – women provide emotional support to frustrated males in capitalist system
        - **Margaret Bentson** – perpetuate unpaid labor
        - **Murray Strauss** – marriage license is a hitting license
        - Sexual abuse, marital rape, violence
        - **Diana Leonard** – set of labor relations where men benefit from and exploit women

                - So changing differentiation, specialization and adaptation leads to change in society
        - **Gordon Childe**
            - Based on material culture of society
            - See who has more material aspects

            - History is a graveyard of aristocracy
        - **Pitirim Sorokin** (**Social and cultural dynamics**): ideational, sensate, idealist
            - **Societies based on cultural mentality**
            - Ideational: v focused on religious/ spiritual values
            - Sensate: focus on empirical analysis and rational observation and materialism
            - Idealist: synthesized culture of these
            - Main push is from within the system
                - Pendulum theory - Sensate and ideational are pure types and hence the society keeps oscillating between these like a pendulum
                - When sensate becomes strong, alternative institutions emerge that will try to push the society towards ideational which emphasise religious culture
                - However doesn’t mention any cause
                - Too much emphasis on one culture leads a push towards another culture

                - Poor empirical analysis
        - **Weber**: conflict can be good, protestant theory
    - Diffusionist theory: change with culture
        - Source of change is from outside society
        - 3 possibilites
            - **Assimilation like US**
            - Acculturization like India
            - Rejection possibility eg tribes
            - **Robert Redfield** – great and little tradition
    - Mal integration theory
        - **Neil Smelser**: With time, society gets dysfunctions as conflicting pressure of demands may put strain on society
        - Incompatibility and strain in society
        - **Merton**: when any part of society becomes dysfunctional, it may be replaced bt a functional alternative , bring about a partial change in structure
        - **Merton** and **Smelser**: dysfunctional theory forms base for change
    - Cultural lag theory: **Ogburn** and **Limkoff**
        - Cultural lag theory suggests there is a lag or delay between technological advancements and their integration into the society
        - This can be seen in contemporary times

            - Other factors affecting change – not a linear relationship
        - Hence, base of govt welfare schemes
    - Convergence theory
        - **Clark Kerr**, **Dunlop**, **Harbison**
        - Similar stimuli like S&T, secularism etc lead to similar convergence across societies irrespective of starting point
        - But too simplistic and not universal
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 99.png>)
        - Will have an homogenizing effect
    - World system theory – **Wallerstein** in **The modern world system**
![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 100.png>)
        - 3 types of economies: core, semi-periphery, periphery

        - Plural ideas and values
        - More symbolic or cultural rather than economic
        - Non violence and disobedience
    - **Gadgil** and **Guha** – while environment movements may be new, environment consciousness has existed since a long time (**The Fissured Land**)
    - **Habermas** (**New social movements**) – NSM is about quality of life and protecting own interests whereas old were focused on economic or military security
    - **Criticism – many have institutionalized themselves like PETA + may of their features were in old movements also**
- **Modernity and social change dialectical relationship**
    - **Complex relation between the two**
    - Opposition and contradiction – often resist each other
