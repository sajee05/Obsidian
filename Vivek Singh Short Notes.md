Good if return on investment > borrowing cost.<br>- **Crowding Out**: Govt. borrowing reduces private investment (fixed savings).<br>- **Crowding In**: Govt. spending boosts demand, induces private investment (unutilized resources).<br>- **Debt Sustainability**: Depends on "interest rate growth rate differential" (IRGD). Negative IRGD (India) = growth leads to debt sustainability.<br>- **Debt-to-GDP Ratio**: Key for fiscal health. Centre (56%), State (29.5%) in 2022-23.<br>- **External Debt**: $610.5bn (19.2% of GDP in 2022). Sovereign (Govt.) & Non-Sovereign (Pvt.).

AAY (2000) for poorest. NFSA (2013) covers 75% rural, 50% urban (84cr people).<br>- **NFSA Provisions**: AAY (35kg/family), Priority (5kg/person) at Rs. 3/2/1 per kg. Women empowerment (head of household). Grievance redressal. Central/State obligations.
