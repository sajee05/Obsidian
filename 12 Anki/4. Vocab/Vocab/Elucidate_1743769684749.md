Elucidate

<hr/>

## Back

Etymology: From Latin ēlucidātus, past participle of ēlucidāre ("to make clear"), from ex- ("out") + lucidus ("clear, bright").

Meaning/Definition: To make something clear; explain or clarify; to shed light on a topic.

Conceptual Explanation: Elucidation involves providing more details, examples, or context to remove any ambiguity or confusion. It's about making something understandable.

(in layman terms: To explain something in a way that makes it easy to understand. It's like shining a light on a topic to make it clear.)

Example 1: The government's spokesperson elucidated the new economic policies during the press conference.

Example 2: The historian elucidated the complex causes of the French Revolution.

Trick to Remember: Imagine "elucidate" as "illuminating" a dark room (topic) with a bright light (explanation).
