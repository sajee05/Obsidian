***Ante*** (before) + ***Natal*** (birth) (crucial period).

- Conceptual Explanation: Crucial period for the health of both mother and child. Early detection of complications and health promotion are key.

- It's the medical care a woman gets while she's pregnant, before the baby is born. It focuses on keeping mom and baby healthy.
