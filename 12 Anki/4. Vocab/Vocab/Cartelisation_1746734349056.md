**Cartelisation**

<hr/>

## Back

📜🔗 **Cartelisation** = *cartello* (agreement document).  
  
🎓✅ Agreement among competing firms to fix prices or limit supply.  
  
🇮🇳🏛️ The Competition Commission investigates *cartelisation* in key industries.  
  
🧠❌💰
- It stops companies from competing properly.  
- This means they can charge higher prices.  
- Customers end up paying more because of this.  
  
💡😄 Think of a 'cart' pushing goods. Companies get in a 'cart' and secretly 'tell' each other prices.
