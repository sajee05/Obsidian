**Mercantilism** 📜🌍: `mercantile` comes from Latin `mercari` (to trade).  
  
📖🎓 An economic policy maximizing exports and minimizing imports for wealth.  
  
🤔💡 It's like a country trying to sell lots of stuff and buy very little from others.  
  
🇮🇳🏛️ British policies in India reflected *mercantilism*, seeking resources and markets.  
  
🧠✨ Countries wanted more gold and silver. They sold goods but bought few. Government strictly controlled trade. Colonies provided resources and markets.  
  
💡😄 **Mercantilism** sounds like **merchant**. A merchant tries to sell *more* than they buy.
