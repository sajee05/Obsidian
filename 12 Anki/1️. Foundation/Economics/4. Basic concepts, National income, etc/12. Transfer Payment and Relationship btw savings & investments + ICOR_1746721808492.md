## 1. 💸 What is a transfer payment, and can you provide an example?  
and Are transfer payments counted separately in the GDP or GNP of a country?

A transfer payment is the transfer of the right to spend. ➡ It is not an income. 🎯 For example, if government transfers money to the Households as an income support measure, it is an example of transfer payment, similarly parents sending money to Child in ORN

No, transfer payments by themselves are not counted separately in the GDP or GNP of a country. Unlike "current transfers" which will eventually get into circular flow of income and will be added to GDP like injections

## 2. 🌍 what is current tranfer + how is it different from transfer payments?

This term is used to signify transfer payments from the rest of the world to a country ➡ called Current transfer. 🎯 For example, remittances received by Indians from abroad.

in simple words= international transfer payments added to current account balance of payments of a country

## 3. 💡 How are current transfers looked at in the context of increases in GDP?

Once they are received, they are expected to be eventually spent, and therefore they will eventually contribute to increases in GDP. 🎯 They can be looked at as injections.

## 4. 💰 And why will the current transfers be eventually spent AND why the ?

When there are current transfers from the rest of the world, it increases the money available in the economy to be spent.

## 5. 🎯 What is the fundamental relationship between savings and investment?

Savings = household savings

Investments = firms investment

When savings ⬆️ = 2 effects = called Push and Pull effects

## 6. 🫸🫷what are the Push and Pull effects of Savings and invetments?

When savings ⬆️ = 2 effects = called Push and Pull effects, where it relates to firms investments. 

increase in savings = people holding more money = more money ➡  value of money decreases = cheaper investment ➡  increased "Ability" to invest. (countries like India needs this due to lack of investments)

Increase in Savings = people holding more money = holding money and not spending = firms dont have "incentive" to invest.  because their current capacity of production should be sufficient to meet the demands of the economy

## 7. 🔄 What kind of overall relationship exists between Savings (S) and Investment (I), and how do different levels of savings affect investment? Answer the following based on the text:
  
a. Describe the overall relationship between S and I.
  
b. How does savings at an adequate level affect investments?
  
c. How might savings beyond a certain level affect investments?

A. There is a push and pull relationship between S and I.
  
B. Savings at an adequate level will incentivize investments.
  
C. Savings beyond a certain level may be rather discouraging for firms to invest.

## 8. 💵 What is ICOR? and what is better for the economy? Lower or Higher ICOR? marginal cost vs ICOR?

"Capital/investment" required for increasing output by one unit.

Lower ICOR means a lesser amount of capital or investment is required to increase output by one unit.

i.e. Lower is better = kam paise (lower cap investment) me output badhega.

marginal cost vs ICOR?  
Marginal cost = total cost  
ICOR = investment
