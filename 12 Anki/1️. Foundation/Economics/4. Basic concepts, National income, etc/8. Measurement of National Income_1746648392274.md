b. Expenditure incurred on imports (M) is not received by the firms in the country ‚û° and hence is not available to be paid to the domestic Factor of production. (Expenditure is done but a part of it is done for imports i.e. out of country toh that expenditure will benifit circular flow of importing country and not mine, isliye) "DOMESTIC PRODUCT" / "NATIONAL" income hai, international income nahi.

c. Expenditure received by the firms equals the aggregate demand¬†(AD) in the economy. jitni logo ki demand hogi, utna hi toh expenditure kiya hoga logo ne.

## 4. üë§ What are the four entities of the economy and their associated expenditures mentioned in the text?

A. HH ‚û° consumption expenditure ‚û° C.  
B. Government ‚û° Government expenditure ‚û° G.  
C. Firms ‚û° Investment expenditure ‚û° I.  
D. Foreigners ‚û° Import expenditure ‚û° X.

## 5. ‚ûï According to the text, what is the formula for the total expenditure incurred in the economy and it is also equal to what?

The total expenditure incurred ‚û° thus is C + G + I + (X-M)¬†= Aggregate demand (AD)

## 6. üìä What is the Production approach to measuring economic activity, Answer the following based on the text:  
a. What is measured in this approach?  
b. What concept is used to measure it?

A. In this approach, we measure the value of goods and services produced by the firms in an economy.  
B. To measure, we use the concept of GDP.

## 7. üéØ How is GDP defined according to the text based on the production approach?

GDP is equal to the total "value" of "final goods and services" ‚û° "produced" "in"¬†an economy ‚û° "in a given time period"¬†‚û° usually a year.

## 8. üìå Why are only final goods counted when calculating GDP, and what problem does counting intermediate goods separately cause? Answer the following based on the text:  
a. Why are only final goods counted?  
b. What happens if intermediate goods are counted separately?

A. We count the value of only final goods produced in the economy ‚û° as their value already consists of the value of intermediate goods utilised in their production.  
B. Counting the intermediate goods separately will result in double counting.

## 9. üí° What does 'Value' mean in the context of calculating GDP, according to the text and whats excluded?

While calculating the GDP ‚û° market price of a good is treated as its value ‚û° meaning only those goods and services which can have a market value will be included. i.e. scientific discoveries/innovation/etc.

## 10. üìÖ What does 'Produce' mean in the context of GDP calculation according to the text and whats excluded?

'Produced' means what has come into existence in the reference time period ‚û° whether something is sold or not is immaterial.

Items based on contracts for future production¬† or payments for items produced in the past ‚û° are not part of GDP for the current period ‚û° because 'produced' refers to what came into existence in the reference time period ‚û° and the value of such items is included in THAT year's GDP in which they were "Produced" or came into existence.

## 11. üåç What does 'IN' refer to in the context of GDP calculation?

'IN' refers to the territorial boundary of the economy where production takes place ‚û° this economic territory may be different from geographical territory.

## 12. üó∫Ô∏è how does economic territory differ from

geographical

## 13. territory? Give example to support your answer.

Economic territory may be different from geographical territory. For example, embassies of a country in a foreign country are considered part of the home country's economic territory ‚û° so services provided at the American embassy in Delhi are part of America's GDP. Production in international waters by domestic flagged vehicles is included in a country's economic territory.

## 14. üíπ What is stock vs flow variable?

{{c10: stock = quanitity measured at a specific "point" of time.

flow= quantity measured over a "period" of time.}}  
  
  
  
  
‚è≥ What does "in a given time period" refer to wrt GDP's nature?

GDP is a flow variable ‚û° which means it measures the value of production between two points of time¬†‚û° in a given time period.
