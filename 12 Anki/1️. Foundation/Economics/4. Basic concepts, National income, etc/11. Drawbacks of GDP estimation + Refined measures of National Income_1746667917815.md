## 1. ðŸ“Š What does GDP represent and what is it also equal to and what it's used for commonly?

GDP is the value of all the goods and services produced in the country âž¡ hence, it is also equal to the value of incomes earnedÂ (PER CAPITA INCOME) in the country and is commonly used metrict to comment on a country's well-being.

Commonly seen- better GDP = better well being. BUT not always- owing to GDP's limitations.

## 3. âœ… Despite its limitations, why is GDP still considered the most dependent, accurate, and used measure?

## 4. ðŸ“Š What are some refined measures of National Income and how are they defined/calculated based on the text? Answer the following:
  
a. National Income (NNP at

Factor Cost

## 5. )?
  
b. Personal Income (PI)?
  
c. Disposable Personal Income (DPI)?
  
d. Per capita income

A. National Income = NNPfc = NNPmp - indirect taxes + subsidies.  
âž¡ National income = GNPmp - Dep - indirect tax + subsidies

B. Personal Income (PI) = Income of Households = National income - income not yet given by Govt and firms.  
âž¡ PI = NI - (Undistributed profit + net interest payments BY Households + corporate taxes) + (transfer payments to the Households by the government and businesses).

\*\*( Transfer Payments = no FOP expected in return eg. parents âž¡ child/govt schemes) âž¡Â  not an income.
