## 1. 💰 What is National Income Accounting (NIA)   
and how is income defined in this context?  
How is the word 'national' interpreted in the context of National Income Accounting?

in NIA, we measure the sum total of payments made in return for providing factor of production either in a country or to the citizens of a country (PAYMENTS ⬅️ when FOP ➡️) (simple words: all the income recived in the country in return of "FOP")

 income is defined as a payment made whenever a factor of production is provided by someone to a producer/firm

National mean either the country or the citizens of the country irrespective of wherever they are.

i.e. National income = Total payments recieved in return of FOP for the country (NATIONAL + INCOME)

Only FOP?

## 2. ⚙️ What are the factors of production and why are they essential in the production process?

essential things needed in order to commence the production process ➡ elements like entrepreneurship, capital, land, and labour

## 3. 💼 What are the four factors of production identified, and what payment is received in return for each? Answer the following based on the text:
  
a. Entrepreneurship?
  
b. Capital?
  
c. Land?
  
d. Labour?

A. Firm does not exist in nature ➡ it is creation of a natural person who assesses responsibilities & risks ➡ function is called entrepreneurship ➡ person is an entrepreneur ➡ payment is dividend/profit  
B. Money is required to start & carry on a business ➡ firm gets capital from different sources ➡ payment is interest  
C. Place required for the firm to produce goods & services ➡ firm pays rent to the land owners ➡ payment is rent  
D. People are required to work in a firm ➡ firm pays them wages ➡ payment is wages

## 4. 🧮 Based on the returns to factors of production, how is national income computed in an economy?

Rent + Wages + Profit + Interest = National Income

## 5. 🛒 In the circular flow, how is national income measured from the perspective of household expenditure? and similarly from the perspective of firm payments to factors of production?

Households purchase the goods produced by the firm ➡ expenditure is revenue for the firm ➡ measuring this expenditure reflects national income

Firm pays incomes to the Households for Factor of Production ➡ measuring these payments reflects national income

## 6. 🔄 What is the conclusion derived from the circular flow model regarding different measurements of the economy's output/income? Answer the following based on the text  
a. How are Goods(B) / Expenditure(C) / Income(A) related?  
b. What does this imply about measuring national income?

A. C = B = A (Income (A) equals Goods (B) equals Expenditure (C)) i.e. Value of incomes earned by the economy are equal to the value of goods and services produced and sold, which in turn are equal to the value of expenditure incurred by Households.  
B. To measure one, it can either be measured directly or indirectly by measuring others.

## 7. 🏛️ What are the key assumptions of the simple two-sector model of the economy or dynamic equilibrium model, based on the circular flow of income model? Answer the following based on the text:

![](paste-f7377ef0f36eb7bc0c3d2ea94d4b49cc9917226e.jpg)

A. There are no savings ➡ that is income=expenditure  
B. Production is all sold ➡ there is no inventory, planned or unplanned  
C. It has no role for the government ➡ which collects taxes and does expenditures  
D. There is no financial sector ➡ where Households can save their money or from where firms can borrow (no savings)  
E. It assumes a close economy ➡ that is no Imports and exports, etc.

## 8. 📈 What are Injections in the context of the economy's value and the circular flow model?

Anything that leads to an increase in the magnitude of the values, A, B, and C (circular flow variables)

 i.e. inflow of income in circular flow (this is where the change is introduced)

## 9. 🚀 how do injections impact firm production and income?

those inflows of money that lead to the firm's producing more goods ➡ requiring more factors of production ➡ hence paying more income ➡ results in more expenditure incurred by the Households and therefore again increases the value of goods produced, Factor of production utilised and incomes earned and so on...

## 10. What are examples of injections mentioned in the text?

Investments, exports, and government expenditure

## 11. 📉 What are Leakages in the context of the economy's value and the circular flow model?

Anything that leads to a reduction in the magnitude of values A, B, and C

## 12. 💧 What are common examples of leakages mentioned in the text?

Common examples of Leakages are Savings, taxes, and imports

## 13. ⚖️ How do injections and leakages affect the equality of A, B, and C (income, goods produced, expenditures received)?

A, B and C will not be equal to each other at any given moment because of fluctuating injections and leakages all the time,

although,  a change in anyone, A, B, or C will set in motion a set of processes or changes to adjust the value of others to the changed value ➡ rather than being statically equal, they will be dynamically equal to each other over a period of time

Therefore the value of incomes earned over a period will be equal to the value of goods produced in that period which will be equal to the value of expenditures received by the firms over that period ➡ whether the economy will grow in size or reduce depends on the magnitude of injections and leakages ➡ Injections and leakages are independent of each other and their relative value keeps on changing and thus the growth in the size/value of the economy
