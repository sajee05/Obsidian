## 1. ‚ùì How do Gross National Product (GNP) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) differ according to the text?

GNP measures the value of output produced by the nationals of the country ‚û° irrespective of where they are üìå

¬†whereas GDP measures the value of output produced in India territory‚û°¬† Irrespective of whether produced by indian or not

## 2. üí∞ Based on the location of producers, what is the formula for Gross National Product (GNP)?

GNP = Output produced by Indians in India (A) + Output produced by Indians outside India (C).

INDIANS ANYWHERE = GNP\*\*

## 3. üîÑ How is Gross National Product (GNP) derived from Gross Domestic Product (GDP) according to the given formulas, incorporating output by foreigners?

GDP = Output produced by Indians in India (A) + Output produced by foreigners in India (B).

GNP = GDP + (Output by Indians abroad - Output by foreigners in India) i.e.

GNP = GDP + (C-B).

## 4. üìä What determines whether Gross National Product (GNP) is greater than Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and what condition leads to GNP being greater?

Whether GNP or GDP is greater depends on the magnitude of Net Factor Income from abroad (NFIA). If NFIA is positive, then GNP is greater ‚û° otherwise GDP is greater. GNP would be greater if the output produced by a country's nationals outside the country is greater than the output produced by foreigners producing in the country.

As, GNP = GDP + (Output by Indians abroad - Output by foreigners in India)

## 5. üí° Why has Gross National Income (GNI) almost completely replaced the usage of the word GNP, according to the text?

This is because it is easier and more accurate to measure the incomes of nationals outside the country ‚û° as compared to measuring the value of production.

## 6. ‚úÖ Explain the Value Added method for calculating the value of output in an economy based on the text.

In this method ‚û° we calculate the value of output in an economy ‚û° by summing up the value-added by all the producers in the economy ‚û° irrespective of whether they are producing final goods or intermediate goods.

## 7. üìà According to the Value Added method, how is the value of a good, specifically a final good, expressed or calculated?

The value of a good can be expressed as a sum value added during all the stages of its production process. The value of a final good = Œ£ Value added in all stages of production = Œ£ VAi (i=intermediaries)

i.e.

GVA = Œ£VAi (Gross value added = Sum of value added in all stages of production)

¬†GVA= GDP = Œ£GVAi

like VAT.

## 8. üéØ The text explains why the Value Added method helps avoid the problem of double counting. Answer the following based on the text:
  
a. What is impractical from a producer's point of view regarding goods classification?  
b. How does the Value Added method inherently avoid double counting?

A. While calculating GDP, we need to separate the final goods from intermediate goods to avoid double counting, however, it is impractical to separate them from a producers' point of view. Because¬†Producers produce goods and are not bothered with how the goods are utilized.
  
b. Since it sums up only the value-added, and not the entire value, there is no problem with double counting and hence the need to separate intermediate from final goods is also obligated.
