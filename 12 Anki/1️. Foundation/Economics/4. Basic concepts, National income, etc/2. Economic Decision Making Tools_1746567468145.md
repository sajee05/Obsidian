## 1. üí∞ What is the definition of the budget constraint in economic decision making according to the text?

The budget constraint is the limiting factor of production ‚û° to project what is the maximum that can be produced in that limiting scenario.

## 2. üåç What does the Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) represent, and how is it related to resource utilization and output levels for developed vs. developing countries. Answer the following based on the text:
  
a. What is the possibility of production given a certain budget called?
  
b. What does PPF represent regarding resource utilization?
  
c. What do points on, below, and beyond the PPF represent?
  
d. How does PPF relate to expected output levels for developed vs. developing countries?

A. The possibility of production given a certain budget is known as a country's production possibilities frontier (PPF). (PPF = maximum possible output in a budget constrain \*\*NOT BUDGET\*\*.)  
B. PPF represents the optimal utilisation of resources.
  
C. The level of output beyond a country's PPF is desirable but not sustainably possible ‚û° whereas the level of output below the PPF is possible but not desirable ‚û° The PPF represents those sets of points of production which are possible as well as desirable.
  
D. For a developed country, the level of output would be expected to be closer to its PPF as its resources are expected to be better utilised ‚û° For the developing country, the level of production is likely to be farther away from PPF as its resources may not yet be explored, utilisable and its workforce is unskilled.

## 3. üìä How does an economist generally handle preferences when making decisions, according to the text?

Will compare actual level of output vs PPF ‚û° An economist generally does not express preferences unless they are objectively measurable ‚û° The decision-maker is the one who decides on preferences ‚û° for example, taste, and externalities associated with certain production ‚û° An economist can at best compare preferences if they are expressed in monetary value terms eg. produce 10kg cotton at 5000rs OR 1kg tobacco at 1000rs.

## 4. ‚úÖ What is the definition of Opportunity Cost as described in the text?

It refers to the benefit forgone ‚û° when a choice is made in favour of one and against the other ‚û° Given a limited resource, a decision-maker chooses what is desirable ‚û° this leads to rejecting something else that may also have been desirable.

## 5. üìà What is the definition of Marginal Cost according to the text?

Cost incurred in the production of one extra unit ‚û° that is given a certain level of production (output) ‚û° how much would it take to produce one more unit.

## 6. ‚öñÔ∏è What do the Law of Demand and the Law of Supply state, assuming

other factors remain constant

## 7. Answer the following based on the text:
  
a. What does the Law of Demand state?
  
b. What does the Law of Supply state?

A. The Law of demand holds that the price of the product increases with an increase in the demand or vice-versa ‚û° provided the other factors remain unchanged.
  
B. The Law of supply holds that with the rise in the price of the product, the supplier will tend to supply more products in the market ‚û° provided other factors remain constant.
