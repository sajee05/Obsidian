## 1. 🔬 What are the two ways the value of output can be calculated in terms of prices  
and for what purpose are each primarily used in GDP analysis?

Based on current year's prevailing prices or past year's prices ➡ Current year prices for GDP calculation ➡ Past year prices for comparing output with the past or longer-term comparison.

WHY? because GDP = Quantity  x  Price

Nominal GDP = Quantity of Present year  x  Price of present year = Mainly used to measure GDP, but wait, does that mean the GDP has grown significantly? what if the Price variable (inflation) increased.

in that case, Real GDP = Q of present year x Price of "past year" / "base year". so that inflation can be adjusted and the comparison can be error free.

## 2. 💰 How is Nominal GDP calculated according to the provided text?

Quantity of present year X prices of the present year.

## 3. 📈 How is Real GDP calculated when evaluating output based on past prices?

Quantity of present year X prices of the past year.

## 4. 🗓️ What is a base year in the context of GDP measurement, and why is it used for longer-term comparisons?

A special year in the past whose prices are used to evaluate subsequent years' GDPs ➡ allows a long-term view of the health of the economy. so that price variable can be adjusted to inflation

## 5. 🤔 what are the two important conditions required to choose a base year?

A. It should be a stable year that is the prices should not be volatile.  
B. It should be a year that is structurally similar in its pattern of production to the present year.

## 6. 📊 How is the GDP deflator defined and calculated using Nominal and Real GDP, as well as the quantities and prices from the input?

GDP Deflator "De-flator" ⬅️looks like inflator's opposite. in reality it is.✅ i.e. to measure effect of inflation. HOW MUCH INFLATION HAPPENED.  ➡ (Quantity of current X price of the current year) / (Quantity of last year X Price of last year).

## 7. 🛒 What is Market price and factor cost and what is the difference, which one does HH recieve?

Market price = is the final price households purchase goods at (includes taxes, excludes subsidied). = income paid by HH = FC + Indirect taxes - subsidies

Factor cost = Cost of production for hiring FOP (paid to HH) = income recieved by HH = MP - Indirect taxes + subsidies

(Incomes me kis baat ka indirect tax, deduct hoga ofc)

## 8. 🧮 How is Factor cost calculated by adjusting Market price based on government interventions?

Adjusting the market price off taxes and subsidies. i.e. FC = MP + indirect tax + subsidies

## 9. 🔗 What is the relationship between Market Price, Factor cost, indirect taxes, and subsidies according to the text?

GDP at Market Price = GDP at Factor Cost + Indirect taxes - Subsidies

## 10. 💡 What does Factor cost refer to according to the text, and what is the basic price defined as?

Factor cost refers to the cost attributable (paid to) to the factors of production ➡ Basic price is defined as the price of the product at the factory gate just before it goes out of the production process.

MP > BP > FC

MP (incl of all taxes) > BP (indirect taxes and subsd not incl) > FC (production taxes and subsidies not incl)

## 11. 🎯 To arrive at true Factor cost, what types of government intervention effects must be removed from the price?

Effect of product taxes and subsidies ➡ Effect of various production level taxes and subsidies.

hierarchy :

FC = core

BP = FC + production taxes - production subsidies  (price of product at factory gate matlab production hogaya production ke taxes lag gaye)

MP =  BP + product tax - product subsidies (indirect taxes levied on final consumer)

## 12. 🚶 How is Factor cost arrived at in two steps from Market price?

A. Market price to basic price:  
 (BP) = MP - Product taxes + product subsidies.

B. Basic price to Factor cost:  
 (FC) = Basic Price - Production Taxes + Production Subsidies.

hierarchy :

FC = core

BP = FC + production taxes - production subsidies  (price of product at factory gate matlab production hogaya production ke taxes lag gaye)

MP =  BP + product tax - product subsidies (indirect taxes levied on final consumer)

## 13. 🇮🇳 What are the four broad steps that the process of GDP estimation in India comprises ?

A. Define what will be counted as production in the economy.  
B. Construct a sample in such a manner that represents the structure of the economy as closely as possible.  
C. From the firms in the sample, collect the output information.  
D. From this information estimate the output of the economy by extrapolating it to the entire economy.

Define production ➡  construct a sample close representation ➡  collect info ➡  extrapolate.

## 14. 🏭 Before 2015, what was the primary sample source used for estimating the output of the entire economy in India?

Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) which had 20000 firms.

## 15. 🔄 What significant changes were introduced in India's GDP estimation method in 2015 regarding the primary data source and what information do the new sources provide?

MCA21 database (ministry of corporate affairs) became the primary source of information ➡ Firms register themselves with Ministry of Corporate Affairs and file information regarding their costs and revenues regularly ➡ This gives access to "value-added" to the MCA.

## 16. 🤔 Why the process of estimation may lead to potential over or underestimation, and what have the UN and IMF done to help compare the sizes of economies fairly?

Requires many assumptions leading to small change possibly leading to over or underestimation ➡ causes loss of credibility if assumption is such they looked biased ➡ UN and IMF developed National System of Accounts, 2008. India's methodology of GDP estimation is fully compliant with the National System of Accounts, 2008

## 17. What is GVA, GDP, basic price, product taxes, product subsidies, factor cost, market price, production taxes, production subsidies ➡  relationship?

Remember, GDP normally written = GDPmp, but GVA normally written = GVAbp

➡  GDP = GDPmp

 ➡  GDPmp = GVAmp

➡  GDPmp = GVAmp = GVAbp + Product taxes - product subsidies

➡  GVA = GVAbp

➡  GVAbp = GVAfc + Production tax - production subsidies

➡  GDP = GVA+ product tax - product subsidies

hierarchy :

FC = core

BP = FC + production taxes - production subsidies  (price of product at factory gate matlab production hogaya production ke taxes lag gaye)

MP =  BP + product tax - product subsidies (indirect taxes levied on final consumer)
