## 1. 📊 What is Inflation according to the provided text, and what does Price refer to as a concept?

Inflation is a general rise in the price level ➡ "General rise " in Price level refers to a mental reference point that a specific set of people may have regarding prices in the economy

Price: refers to the value of a good in terms of a measuring unit. Eg. Price of 1 apple = 10 bananas. etc. Measuring unit can be anything but generally its money

## 2. ❓ The price of a good has two main parts, What are they?

The price of the good has two parts:

1. its own demand and supply (Intrinsic) i.e rise in the price of Gold. earlier 1kg gold = 60,000 now 70,000

2. the demand and supply of the measuring unit. (Extrinsic) ie. fall in the value of money, i.e. earlier 70,000 = 1kg gold, now 90,000 = 1kg gold thus making price of gold appear to be more

## 3. 📈 What is Demand-pull inflation and what factors lead to it according to the text?

We know, increase in demand = increase in price (law of demand)

so, Demand-pull inflation=

Factors that lead to an increase in demand. Factors include ➡ increase in income, changing tastes and preferences, rising population, etc.

in easy words: Demand increased which led to inflation.

## 4. 📉 What is Cost-push inflation according to the text, what are its causes, and what is an example?

Low supply = Price increase we know.

so, Cost-push inflation: Factors that lead to a reduction in supply ➡ Causes can be constraints in the availability of raw materials or factors of production, increase in their cost, government policies such as business, environment, and labour, poor infrastructure, etc. ➡ Anything that causes a reduction in aggregate supply that is the total output of the economy, will be a supply-side factor or a cost-push cause of inflation ➡ Example: constrain in the availability of raw materials or factors of production.

## 5. 🤝 What does Cartelization refer to and what is its effect on prices based on the text? Provide an example.

Cartelization: A cartel refers to a group of producers coming together and behaving in a monopolistic manner rather than competing with each other ➡ Effect: leads to higher prices for goods due to unrestricted profits which can be made in a monopolistic environment ➡ Example: cement producers come together to sell it at a higher than fair price due to cartelization.

## 6. 🌍 What International factors can influence price changes according to the text, and what do they include?

International factors: include factors such as geopolitical relationships between countries, tensions leading to difficulty in international movements, or broadly factors that result in disruption of supplies due to sanctions or domestic political considerations ➡ These factors result in non-availability despite there being a supply and hence lead to inflation ➡ They also include decisions of monetary policy of one country affecting the value of the currency of another country, making the cost of imports higher than usual.

## 7. 🩸 What is Hyperinflation?

Hyperinflation: Very high or intolerable rate of inflation.

## 8. 🏛️ What is Structural inflation, and what are some contributing factors mentioned?

structure = rigid ➡  hard to change. (remember stuctural unemployment?)

Structural inflation: Inflation is due to factors that are slow to be addressed that is factors that have a persistent character ➡ Factors: slower decision-making in the administration, poor infrastructure, etc.

## 9. 🤏 What is Skew inflation according to the text, and what is an example?

Skew inflation: When inflation is because of a small set of goods or services ➡ In this, there is a general rise in prices, but it is largely attributable to only a few goods and services ➡ Example:30,000 ➡  35,000 monthly budget mostly attributed to oil and petrolium.

## 10. 📰 What is Headline inflation, how is it commonly reported, and why is it important for policy making?

Headline inflation: Inflation number is commonly reported as it is important for policy making

## 11. 📊 What measure is presently used as the headline measure for inflation?

Presently Consumer Price Index is our headline measure. 3.34% in march 2025

## 12. 📉 What is Deflation?

Deflation: It is a fall in prices that is a negative rate of inflation.

(IMAGE 🎈➡  DEFLATED) = INFLATION KHATM

## 13. ↘️ What is Disinflation?

Disinflation: It is a fall in the rate of inflation ➡ Prices still rise, albeit at a slower pace.

🎈 ➡  STILL BEING INFLATED BUT AT A LOWER PACE.

## 14. 📉📈 What is a Recession, and what is the time criteria for it?

Recession: Contraction in the output of the economy for two consecutive quarters

## 15. ⏬ What is a Depression, and what is the time criteria for it?

Depression: A severe or prolonged recession ➡ Time criteria: There are no time criteria.

## 16. 📏 What is Shrinkflation according to the text?

Shrinkflation: A reduction in quantity which you get at the same price is shrinkage of packet size.

2010: NICE Toast 5 Rs = 100g

2020: NICE Toast 5 Rs = 25g

## 17. 🛍️ What is Core inflation based on the text? Answer the following based on the text:  
a. What items are included?
  
b. What items are excluded and why?
  
c. What has been proposed regarding core inflation?

A. non-fuel and non-food items.
  
B. Food and fuel items are excluded ➡ because they have volatile prices such as due to geopolitical factors, Natural calamities, etc ➡ These items are removed and the prices of the remaining baskets are tracked through core inflation   
C. Automotive petrolum ➡ They are not a part of the fuel basket i.e. counted in core inflation ➡ Hence, the core inflation, at present does not represent a truly non-volatile basket of goods and services.  
It has been proposed that such items be also removed to arrive at a better, more refined measure of core inflation.

## 18. 🔄 What is Stagflation according to the text? Answer the following based on the text:  
a. When is it *not* characterized as stagflation?
  
b. When is stagnation considered? in this context?   
c. What is the implication for policy-making during stagflation and why this implication?

A. Merely one of the two (stagnation or high or rising inflation) without the other would not be characterized as stagflation. i.e. stagnant eco growht + inflation  
B. Stagnation to the extentn, that ➡  Unemployment rises as jobs compared to the number of people entering the labour force decrease ➡ Therefore, unemployment rises. When this rise in unemployment is surprisingly accompanied by high inflation, then it is called stagflation   
C. Addressing one will further worsen the other ➡ Therefore, during such times policy-making is highly uncertain and hence this situation is difficult to address.

this is because - as observed by philip curve, inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship. specially in the short term. unemployment ⬇️ prices ⬆️, But during the stagfaltion, it gets confusing and trying to fix one will worsen the other.
