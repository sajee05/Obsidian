## 1. What are the three different viewpoints from which unemployment can be seen?

Unemployment can be seen from three viewpoints: ➡  
1. a general view (macroeconomic school of thought)   
2. a view closer to the economy (why unemployment exists in a particular economy like unemployment rate)  
3. a view closer to the individual (why a particular person is unemployed)

## 2. 📊 What are the types of unemployment according to the macroeconomic school?

According to the macroeconomic school, unemployment can be classified into classical unemployment and Keynesian unemployment

## 3. 📉 What is the Law of Demand in the context of labor markets?  
a. What does it refer to?  
b. What factors does demand depend on?  
c. What does it say about quantity

a. The Law of Demand refers to the QUANTITY ⬇️ PRICE ⬆️   
b. The demand for a good depends on factors such as the price, status, culture, trends and preferences, income, taxes, quality, expectations, market competition, price of related goods, etc.   
 c. The Law of Demand says the quantity demanded of a good is dependent on the aggregate demand, assuming all other factors constant-except price (as it effects aggregate demand) i.e. the quantity demanded decreases with an increase in price and vice-versa, given other factors remain constant

## 4. 📈 What is the Law of Supply in the context of labor markets?  
a. What does it state about quantity supplied?  
b. What does it mean for workers?  
c. What is needed for producers?

a. The Law of Supply states that the quantity supplied of a good i.e., the quantity which the producers are willing to sell their goods or services (labour in this case) increases with price i.e. PRICE ⬆️ SUPPLY ⬆️+ b. In labor markets, this means workers are willing to offer more hours or more people enter the workforce as wages increase + c. Quantity produced will increase with the sale of price as more producers are able to enter the market at a higher price (why? different costs for diff producers, i.e. if price is high even the ones with more costs can enter)

## 5. 📊 What is a demand schedule and what does its shape indicate and what is the shift of demand curve?

A demand schedule is a downward sloping curve representing the inverse relationship of quantity demanded and price ➡ It is plotted in terms of quantity and if those conditions change we need to plot a new demand curve ➡ This is called the shift of the curve   
  
in simple words,Demand Schedule slopes downwards - represting the inverse relationship of quanitity with price. (Quantity increase, price decrease and vice versa)

## 6. 📊 What factors affect the Decision of producers according to the Law of Supply?

The decision of producers depends on factors such as:  
➡ Prices fixed set by the market  
➡ Production costs like price of raw materials and other factors  
➡ Cost and profitability including factors of production: Land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship  
➡ Cost and availability of raw materials  
➡ Infrastructure in the economy  
➡ Level of technology  
➡ Government policies or labour laws, taxation laws, environmental laws, business regulations, etc.

## 7. 💰 What is classical unemployment according to economists?  
a. Why does it exist?  
b. What are 2 causes?  
c. What is the relationship between wages and labor supply/demand?  
d. What happens at equilibrium and how it happens (solution)?

a. According to classical economists, unemployment exists because wages in the labor market are too high   
 b. This could happen due to minimum wage laws or trade unions that have negotiated for higher wages or the government which has set higher than equilibrium wages   
 c. In the labour market, labour themselves are the supplier of labour (law of demand and supply would be applied) i..e ➡ The demand for labour would be inversely proportional to the price of labour i.e., wage and the supply of labour would be directly proportional   
d. If there is no intervention in the labour market (by b.) and the wages are allowed to settle at the equilibrium level, then there would be no unemployment as the demand for labour and the supply of labour would be equal

## 8. 💰 What is minimum wage according to economic theory?  
a. Set by who?  
b. Which Act?  
c. Its based on what?  
d. How is floor wage related to this?

a. It is a statutory wage that lays down the minimum wages to be given for an activity or a specific task It is fixed by the Central or State government   
b. through Minimum Wages Act, 1948   
c. Minimum wages are fixed depending on the skill level   
d. The least of minimum wages is called the "Floor wage" ➡ Floor wage may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the minimum wage law

## 9. 🏠 What is living wage in economic theory?  
a. How is it defined?  
b. How is it determined?  
c. How does government relate to it?

a. Living wage is a minimum wage considered necessary to live a dignified life + b. It is a subjective wage rate ➡ suggested usually by an expert panel + c. The government may consider living wage to arrive at statutory minimum wage

## 10. ⚖️ What is fair wage and how does it relate to other wage types?

Fair wage is the wage that lies somewhere between the living wage and the minimum wage ➡ lies between the two and would be acceptable to employers while ensuring a reasonable living for those seeking employment

## 11. ⭐ 💲 What is equilibrium price in a market and what happens at this price?  
a. What is P0?  
b. What happens when price > P0?  
c. What happens when price < P0?  
d. What is the role of bargaining (what it depcits)?

a. The price P0 is called the equilibrium price at which there is no upward or downward pressure on the price   
b. If the price is greater than P0 then = (Qs > Qd), there would be some producers who won't be able to sell their produce in the market and hence would be willing to sell at a lower price   
c. If the price is lower than P0, there would be excess demand and prices would tend to rise toward equilibrium   
d. Bargaining is the property of an inefficient/imperfect market, but in a well-functioning market, the supplier could set their prices (matlab = imperfect market me consumer ko price zyada lagta hai, perfect me price ok for the consumer's perpsective)
