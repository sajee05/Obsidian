## 1. üìä What is the source of unemployment data in India since 2017?

Unemployment is estimated from the PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey) ‚û° Before this, EUS (Employment Unemployment Survey) was used ‚û° PLFS has a larger sample size and different technique of collecting information

## 2. üìã How does PLFS differ from EUS in terms of methodology, can it be compared?

In PLFS, households are visited once every quarter ‚û° The recall period is much shorter than EUS (which visited once a year) ‚û° Results are expected to be more accurate ‚û° Cannot be strictly compared with results of EUS (alag alag methods se calculations hua tha kaise compare hoga?)

## 3. üìâ What has been the trend in unemployment rate according to PLFS?

Unemployment rate has come down to 3.2% in 23-24 from 6% in 2017-18‚û° LFPR has increased to 42.42% ‚Üí LFPR WOMEN‚¨ÜÔ∏è = increased to 41.7% in 23-24 from 23.3% in 2017-18

## 4. üë®‚Äçüåæ What factors might explain the fall in unemployment rate in India and opinion?

Attributed largely to distress employment in the two sectors:   
1. Increase in agricultural jobs (already saturated not good for india)  
2. Increase in self-employment (low productivity for the country)  
= undesriable

## 5. üìà What is jobless growth and what causes it?

to understand it first we need to understand what constitutes growth,  
The growth of a country can be attributed largely to two reasons:   
1. Increase in the quantity of factors of production   
2. Increase in the productivity of factors of production   
  
(quantity x productivity / time x intensity = growth)

i.e. GDP Grows but its not because of employing more people BUT either one of the 2 factors (quanitity or productivity)'s increment

## 6. ‚öôÔ∏è What is Employment Elasticity and how is it measured?

Measures the sensitivity of employment to a country's economic growth (employment's role in economic growth) ‚û° It is defined by how much employment changes with every 1% change in economic growth ‚û° Employment elasticity = (% change in employment/percentage change in output (production)) = (‚àÜL/L)/(‚àÜY/Y) [‚àÜ=matlab change]‚û° It is a measure of economic growth to employment growth versus productivity growth   
![](paste-c93bf576afacf222f799d32c1d8039e319fcab4e.jpg)  
More¬†the employment elasticity, more the employment is sensitive to economic growth. i.e. kitni growth hogi toh kitni emplloyment hogi?

## 7. üìäTrend of Employment elasticity in India?

In case of India, Employment elasticity has seen a declining trend ‚û° It has come down from around 0.75 in the 1970s and 80s to around 0.1 in the 90s and has drastically fallen to less than 0.2 since the 2000s ‚û° During 2004 to 2009 it came down to 0.01 matlab "JOBLESS GROWTH BOHT ZYADA HAI"¬†productivity‚Üí doosre 2 factors ki wajah se growth hui instead of employment.  
economy grew at 7% BUT employment grew at 2% ONLY.

## 8. üîç What is the observed of low Employment Elasticity in India?

It can be seen that more contribution to economic growth is attributable to an increase in productivity and less to an increase in employment ‚û° This has been characterized as jobless growth ‚û° The economy grew at a robust pace of more than 7% since the year 2000 whereas employment has grown only at the rate of around 2.8 since then  
matlab¬†"JOBLESS GROWTH BOHT ZYADA HAI"¬†productivity‚Üí doosre 2 factors ki wajah se growth hui instead of employment.  
economy grew at 7% BUT employment grew at 2% ONLY.

## 9. ‚öñÔ∏è What is the counter argument regarding jobless growth in India?

Even though employment elasticity has been falling, the growth rate of employment has always been greater than the growth rate of labour force in and the number of new jobs created has been sufficient to absorb the people entering the labour force ‚û° This is reflected in the fact that despite the falling employment elasticity, the unemployment rate has been falling between 5.2 to 5.8 % since 1999 ‚û° According to ILO estimates such as each economic growth should not be characterized as being jobless  
  
in simple words,  
1. employment elasticity kam hai, but LFPR rate se zyada hai, jobs are sufficient.  
2. ILO doesnt recommend using estimates of economic growth as jobless
