## 1. 🔄 What is cyclical unemployment according to Keynesian perspective?

Cyclical unemployment is the unemployment over and above the unemployment in the economy had it grown at an average pace ➡ It corresponds to the economic cycle during high growth, unemployment is less and vice versa ➡ When economy grows at a lower than average pace (expected pace), it will experience higher than usual unemployment

## 2. 🌊 How do economic cycles relate to unemployment patterns?

An economy grows through cycles of ups and downs with periods of high growth, slowdown, recession, and recovery ➡ These phases are cyclical + during these phases unemployment corresponds to the economic cycle ➡ During high growth periods, unemployment is less and vice versa ➡ An economy may be stuck in a phase of low growth and experience higher cyclical unemployment for a prolonged period

## 3. 🎯 What is the main objective of policymakers regarding cyclical unemployment?

To ensure that the economy gets out of the phase of high unemployment as quickly as possible

## 4. 📉 What does Keynes identify as the primary reason for increased unemployment?

The fall in Aggregate Demand (AD) ➡ AD is the total demand for all goods and services in the economy + the demand that all firms together experience in an economy

## 5. 🧩 What constitutes Aggregate Demand in Keynesian economics? What is the formula?

Demand from households:   
Consumption Expenditure (C) ➡ Government: Government Expenditure (G) ➡ Businesses: Investment expenditure (I) ➡ Foreigners: Net Foreign Expenditure (X-M)   
  
Formula: AD= C+G+I+(X-M)

## 6. 💸 Why does consumption expenditure decrease during a recession?

Households would face unemployment and earn very low wages ➡ Since C is low, AD is low + therefore businesses will not invest as they expect to sell their goods i.e. unless AD improves and observes a fall in employment

## 7. 🏭 How do businesses behave during recession wrt employing labour according to Keynesian theory?

They will not invest as they expect to sell their goods i.e. unless AD improves ➡ Merely because labour may be available at a low wage rate, does not mean that businesses will employ them \*\*(contradiction to classical theory which says, price⬇️demand⬆️)➡ When businesses invest more, employment is created ➡ During recession, there is already an unutilized production capacity in the economy + businesses will not invest

## 8. 📊 Which component of Aggregate Demand can be most effectively manipulated during recession? (solution to unemployment according to keynes?)

Government Expenditure (G) ➡ "I" is autonomous and therefore cannot be modeled ➡ The only component of AD that can be increased is G: Government Expenditure ➡ Keynes suggests increasing G to increase AD, to increase I, and hence, create employment

## 9. 💰 What issues/challenge emerges when implementing Keynesian solutions during recession?

During a recession, Government revenues are already less and therefore the ability of the government to spend is already less than usual ➡ Government needs to borrow

## 10. ⚠️ What are the risks associated with government borrowing for stimulus?

1) It may cause crowding out of the private sector (private ke liye credit hi nai bachega)  
2) It causes inter-generational inequality i.e. the future generation pays for the money borrowed today  
3) Excessive government spending would be inflationary as the production will lag the expenditure + it will lead to the depreciation of local currency   
  
  
Misc. politicians like this approach as it gives them academic backing for expenditure.
