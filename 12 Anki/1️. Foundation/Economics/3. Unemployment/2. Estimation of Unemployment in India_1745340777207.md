## 1. 📊 How is Unemployment measured And What is the (PLFS) in India?

Unemployment is calculated by PLFS, since 2017,   
[ealier it used to be by EUS (Employment Unemployment Survey.) every 5 years.]  
  
 (Periodic Labour Force Survey) is conducted quarterly in urban areas and annually at all-India levels since 2017-18 (april 17)

## 2. 🔍 How does PLFS improve unemployment estimation accuracy?

PLFS improves the accuracy of estimating unemployment by increasing the sample size + making it more diverse ➡ This makes it more representative of the economy

## 3. 📝 What is the basic process of estimation of unemployment in India?

A sample is drawn to collect the information by NSSO ➡ A set of questions are asked by the respondents + their responses are judged based on certain principles or approaches ➡ Based on assessment, either of the 3 status is assigned to the people based on priority i.e. employed, unemployed, not in the labour force.

## 4. 🧮 How is the Unemployment rate calculated?

Unemployment rate = Status-2 / (status-1 + status-2) ➡ Where Status-1 represents employed persons + Status-2 represents unemployed persons (not working but looking for work)

## 5. 👨‍💼 What determines if a person is part of the labour force in unemployment estimation accordng to Usual status approach?

A person is part of the labour force if he was economically active for a majority of the last year (economically active matlab looking for work "labour force") ➡ The majority of the time during the last year (i.e., 183 days) ➡ The person is considered to be a part of the labour force for the entire year

## 6. 💼 What Principle status in unemployment measurement?

If the person was able to find work for the majority of time for which he was in the labour force ➡ Such a person is said to be principally employed ➡ Otherwise, the person is principally unemployed   
  
jitne din economically active tha uske maximum days kaam mil gaya. → toh principally employed.

## 7. 🔄 How is subsidiary status considered in unemployment measurement?

Subsidiary status refers to short-term or part-time work that a person does for at least 30 days in a year, even if they're mostly unemployed the rest of the time (principally unemployed) ➡ The unemployment rate commonly reported consists of those people whose both principal and subsidiary status is unemployed Assuming unemployment rate is usually depecting "TOTALLY UNEMPLOYED"

- Even if you were principally unemployed, if you worked for 30+ days → Subsidiary status employed
- If you didn't even work for 30 days → Subsidiary status unemployed

Totally unemployed = principle status (half time of her LF) + subsidary status (30 days) is unemployed.

## 8. 📆 What is the Current Weekly Status approach to measure unemployment?

In CWS a person is considered employed if he was able to find work for at least one hour on any one day during the previous seven days preceding the day of the (survey) interview ➡ Usually higher + The methodology is accurate because of shorter recall period and more importantly, it can capture seasonality in employment

## 9. When is Weekly status approach better than usual status?

In economy where a large number of jobs have seasonal characteristics, CWS approach can better than the Usual Status

## 10. ⏱️ What is the Current Daily Status approach to measure unemployment?

CDS was an approach to measuring unemployment using the intensity of work during the 365 days of the year ➡ It does not measure unemployment using the person approach ➡ It measures unemployment by accounting for employment intensity ➡ It considers the number of hours that a person has worked relative to the number of hours the person was available for work

## 11. 📏 How does the Current Daily Status approach divide a workday?

It considers a day to be divided into two halves ➡ For each half it assigns a status-code depending on whether the person worked with intensity (that is 0.5) + working less than 1 hour with 0% intensity ➡ The population's total working intensity is calculated and compared to the population ➡ This is used to calculate the unemployment rate as lost time for work
