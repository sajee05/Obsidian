## 4. üîÑ What is Natural Rate of Unemployment, whats is AKA and what characterizes it AND it's relationship with price?

AKA Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment ‚û° It is the unemployment that exists in an economy in the background, i.e. naturally¬†(unemployment is expected to be permanent)‚û° This means that unemployment in which the economy is at an equilibrium level ‚û° Classical Unemployment (demand, supply) is NOT there and the cyclical factors have played out i.e., the economy is NOT witnessing either a cycle of low growth or high growth ‚û° At this point, the unemployment or the economy will consist only of those who are structurally, seasonally, frictionally, or voluntarily unemployed ‚û° It is the rate of unemployment at which inflation does not accelerate ‚û° i.e. if unemployment is less than this level it would be expected that prices would rise (LOGO KE PAAS JOBS HONGI, PAISE HONGE = MORE AD = PRICE RISE) , and if unemployment is above this level then prices would be expected to fall
