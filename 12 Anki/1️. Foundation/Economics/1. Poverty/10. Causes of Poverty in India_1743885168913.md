## 2. What is the rate at which India's population has increased annually over the past 45 years? 🌍

2.2% per year → which means an average of about 17 million people are added to the country's population each year → This also increases the demand for consumption goods tremendously

## 3. What is a major reason for poverty related to agricultural productivity in India? 🌾

Low productivity in the agriculture sector → manifested chiefly because of  
1. fragmented and subdivided land holdings +   
2. lack of capital +  
3. illiteracy about new technologies in farming +   
4. use of traditional methods of cultivation +  
5.  wastage during storage

## 4. How has resource utilization affected poverty in India? 🏭

Inefficient Resource Utilisation → There is underemployment and disguised unemployment in the country, particularly in the farming sector → This has resulted in low agricultural output and also led to a dip in the standard of living

## 5. What characterized India's economic development in the first 40 years after independence? 📈

Low rate of Economic Development (minimal, later from 90s to 2011 it halved) → Economic development has been low in India especially in the first 40 years of independence before the LPG reforms in 1991

## 6. How does price rise contribute to poverty in India? 💰
