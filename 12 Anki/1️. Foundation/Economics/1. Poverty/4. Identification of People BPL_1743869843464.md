## 1. Why do we need to identify poor people primarily? 🤔

Primarily for two purposes: ➡ To provide benefits under anti-poverty programs of the government ➡ To count them from time to time so we can assess progress on poverty alleviation

## 2. What led to the creation of BPL Census and what was its purpose? 📝 and Which committees are involved?

The government started the process of streamlining schemes (BK Chaturvedi committee) as well as the process of identifying the beneficiaries under those schemes (NC Saxena) NCS Committee's task ➡ to lay down common criteria for identifying BPL households

## 3. When was SECC conducted and what was its objective? 📊

SECC was conducted in 2011 ➡ It was done to identify households based on certain deprivation parameters

## 4. What are the three classifications of households according to the SECC? 📋

1. Automatically included: Those households that were truly deprived therefore were the beneficiaries of all government anti-poverty programs (including PVTGs, bonded laborers)   
  
 2. Automatically excluded: Those households deemed as not generally deserving benefits (e.g., those with more than 10 hectares of land, motorized vehicles)  
  
 3. Deprived: Households that were neither very rich nor very poor + assessed on various dimensions to determine eligibility for specific anti-poverty programs

## 5. What does PVTGs stand for? 🏞️

Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups

## 6. In the 2011 SECC, what was the approach to households that fell in the "Deprived" category? 🔍

Their deprivation status was assessed on various dimensions ➡ Based on that assessment they were made eligible for anti-poverty programs ➡ But only for those specific dimensions in which they were deprived

## 7. What problem arose from multiple government schemes having their own beneficiary identification criteria and not common? ⚠️

It became overlapping and tiresome due to this redundancy ➡ It takes effort every time the poor person needs to identify himself as a beneficiary ➡ This causes loss of precious time of workers away from work

## 8. What was the primary role of the BK Chaturvedi committee? 🏛️

streamline all the schemes ➡ grouping of schemes

## 9. What was the primary role of the NC saxena Committee? 📝
