Undervalues currency

- **Lower price levels** in developing countries for non-tradable goods and services (like rent, labor).
- **Wage differences**: Labor costs are lower, reducing overall prices.
- **Less demand for the currency** in global financial markets.
- **Limited capital inflows**, keeping the currency weaker.
- **Productivity gaps** between developed and developing economies.

So, while a currency may go further domestically (high ppp), it may be weaker internationally (low market rate), making ppp lower than the market exchange rate.
