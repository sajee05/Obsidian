## 1. What is Poverty according to world bank?

poverty is pronounced deprivation in well-being + comprises many dimensions --> It includes low incomes and the inability to acquire basic goods and services necessary for survival with dignity --> Includes lack of access to basic health and education facilities, lack of access to clean drinking water and sanitation, lack of social security, lack of voice, and the inability and lack of opportunity to better one's life

## 2. Why is consumption expenditure preferred over income for measuring poverty? 💰

Due to the uncertainty and volatility of income --> Consumption expenditure is more stable + provides a better measure of actual living standards --> Deprivation on Consumption Expenditure is therefore used to measure poverty

## 3. What makes poverty a normative concept? 🤔

poverty is a subjective concept as it has different aspects of well-being on which different people have different opinions --> This makes it a statement of opinion rather than an objective fact --> It requires value judgments about what constitutes an acceptable standard of living

## 4. What is the objective measurable dimension of well-being commonly used to measure poverty? 📏

Income (volatile and possibility of lie) and therefore deprivation on Consumption Expenditure --> This provides a quantifiable metric that can be standardized + allows for comparison across different populations

## 5. What is Absolute poverty? ⚖️

It is poverty measured according to set standards of poverty measurement --> The term "absolute" has no connotations regarding the severity of poverty --> Standards are usually opinions of expert body accepted by authority responsible for measuring poverty --> Sometimes referred to as normative poverty (because standards are subjective) --> Helps in comparison of poverty across different times (temporal comparison) and places (spatial comparison)

## 6. What is Relative poverty and how is it expressed? 🔄

When poverty status is expressed through comparison between two persons or two sets of people --> Based on inequality + helps in understanding relative poverty better --> Often expressed as income/GDP/wealth of population in comparison to fixed reference point such as median of population, mean of population, etc.  
  
relative = a is poorer than b  
absolute = based on standard. and helps in comparison  
absolute aka normative? = subject- as the standards are subjective.

## 7. What is needed to measure poverty in an objective way? 📊

Objectively measurable criteria --> So that a standard can be set + poverty assessed accordingly --> This allows for consistent measurement across different regions and time periods
