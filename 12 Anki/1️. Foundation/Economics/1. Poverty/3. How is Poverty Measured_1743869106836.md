## 1. What are the two common ways to measure the depth of poverty? 🔍

poverty Gap & Squared poverty Gap

## 2. HOW does the poverty Gap measure? 📏

It measures the depth by calculating the average distance of people below the poverty line from the poverty line

## 3. HOW does the Squared poverty Gap measure? 📊

It measures the depth by calculating the root mean squared distance of the people below the poverty line from the poverty line

## 4. How is poverty Gap calculated if the poverty line is Rs 10,000 and 3 people with CE= 2k, 5k and 8k? 💰

Average distance from the poverty line (10,000) = (2000+5000+8000)/3 = 5000, 10,00 se 5000 RS kam hai

## 5. How is Squared poverty Gap calculated if the poverty line is Rs 10,000 with people's CE= 2k, 5k, 8k? 📉

Root Mean Squared distance from poverty line = square root of [(2000) + (5000)+ (8000)^2]/3 = around 5567.76 (more average depth of poverty 10,000 se 5567.76 rs KAM hai. )

## 6. What is the significance of depth in poverty measurement (WHY) ? 🤔

The depth is a measure of the gravity of deprivation ➡ i.e. the gravity of poverty ➡ It is a mental reference point that is trying to convey how much would a person who is below the poverty line have to traverse to escape the poverty line

## 7. Why is the depth of poverty important to measure? 📈

The greater the distance, the greater the depth ➡ It shows how far people are from escaping poverty

## 8. How does Squared poverty Gap provide a different perspective compared to poverty Gap? 🔄

It tries to convey a greater distance and hence a deeper extent of poverty by calculating the depth using the Root-Mean-Squared method ➡ By doing this, the reference point i.e. depth is pushed downwards which is more toward the people who are deeper in poverty ➡ Hence is able to capture the extra effort that those who are farther away from the poverty line would have to undertake to escape the poverty line
