## 1. 📊 What is the Kuznets curve in the context of inequality?

It represents the expected relationship between income per capita (economic growth) and inequality over a period of time ➡️ According to Kuznets, it is expected that inequality will initially worsen, then stabilize and then reduce

## 2. 📈 What are the three phases of the Kuznets curve according to the image and why does this happen?

Phase of increasing inequality ➡️ Phase of stabilization ➡️ Phase of reduction.  
  
it happens as, economy grows = new investmenet opportunities → already wealthy will invest + migration of labour class from rural to urban = widening inequality at first.  
But, investment and industrialisation = employment   
according to kuznet's hypothesis, the inequality is supposed to decrease as a certain level of avg income is reached.

## 3. ❓ What is the nature of kuznets curve?

It's an "expectation", kuznet's hypothesis

## 4. what is Enviornment Kuzents?

Similar to inequality kuznets curve, first env pollution increases then decreases once a certain level of economic growth is achived.

## 5. 📉 What is the Lorenz Curve?

A graphical representation of inequality in the country ➡️ It plots the distribution of wealth/income/etc. in the population i.e.

## 6. 🔍 What exactly does the Lorenz Curve plot according to the image?

The cumulative share of wealth amongst the cumulative share of people from lowest to highest (expression of wealth) what % of population posses what % of wealth.

## 7. ![](paste-ce8a6172c855377a684d4dfd27f7ac0f41bce657.jpg)  
📏 What does the line OA (line of equality) represent in the Lorenz Curve diagram?

The line of perfect equality representing perfectly equal distribution of wealth in the population

## 8. 📐 What does the line BA (perfect inequality) represent in the Lorenz Curve diagram?

The line of perfect inequality ➡️ Where entire wealth is with just one person and the remaining population has exactly zero wealth

## 9. 🌐 Where is a country's Lorenz curve typically positioned?

Somewhere between the line of equality and the line of inequality ➡️ The more unequal the country the further its Lorenz curve is from the line of equality and closer to OB (the line of inequality)

## 10. 📊 What is the Gini Coefficient?

\*\*DERIVED FROM LORENZ CURVE\*\*  
The statistical I.E. (Graphical and %) measurement of inequality ➡️ With 2 important properties: the value of coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 + the more equal the society, the less Gini Coefficient and vice versa   
0= least, 1= max.  
  
in simple words, gini coefficient = measurement of income distribution. i.e. equal (0) OR unequal (1)

## 11. in summary, curves shows:  
→ Kuznets =

Economic growth (income per capita) and inequality

## 12. → lorenz =

perfect equality and perfect inequality, curve showing reality. % of wealth held by % of popln.

## 13. → Gini-coefficient =

statisical measurement of inequality i.e.  
 (representation of lorenz curve , perfect equality = 0, inequality = 1. closer to 0 = more equality. formula? A/a+b  
  
A= area between perfect equality and lorenz curve,  
B =Area between lorenz curve and perfect inequality
