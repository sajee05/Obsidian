## 1. What are the 2 reasons for inequality?

1. Conventional reasons →  
a. natural advantage, (birth, nature)   
b. comparative advantage, (Favoured conditions)  
c. economic reasons/marxist. (ROC>ROL)  
2. Modern reasons → capital returns > labour wages, 20% bz survival = monipolistic tendencies = unfair means.

## 2. What does the term "natural advantages" refer to in the context of inequality (conventional reason)? 🌍

Natural advantages refer to the benefits some places, societies, or households have due to accidents of birth or location. ➡ Because of certain natural endowments, they are better equipped to earn more or progress faster. ➕ This can be due to natural resources, good climate, or fertile land,  etc.

## 3. What is Curse of resources? and How can the "curse of resources" paradoxically lead to inequality (with respect to natural inequality - conventional reasons)? ♻️

Simply put, Inverse realtionship between natural endowmenets and development. (ex: africa) BUT wrongly attributed, as its actually not curse of resources but inability to utilize those resources properly due to various factors such  as poor governance, civil was, social unrest, etc.  
  
The curse of resources describes an inverse relationship where abundant natural endowments do not always lead to development. ➡ BUT this is wrongly attributed to the existence of natural resources →  but the lack of development often results from an inability to utilize resources productively. ➕ This may be due to poor governance, civil war, social unrest, or inaccessibility of resources.

## 4. What does "comparative advantage" mean as a reason for inequality (conventional reason)? 🔄

Comparative advantage means that despite having the same natural endowments, one place, society, or person may have some advantage over the other—such as skills or access—leading to more growth or wealth, and thus causing inequality.   
ex: devesh and me to same school, but i learnt how to speak and read english in early age which gave me comparative advantage and caused inequality.

## 5. Explain the economic reason behind the persistence of inequality (conventional reason). 💰

The economic reason is that the growth of profit (i.e., return on capital) has generally been greater than the return on labour. ➡ As profits are appropriated by the capitalist and not shared with labour, this results in inequality between those who own capital and those who only provide labour.

## 6. What is Modern Reasons?

over a long period cus of capital returns > labour wages → widened inequality gap  
20% bz survives in 20 years = monipolistic tendencies → more profit share with less competition = rely on fair and unfair means.

## 7. Why does the return on capital versus return on labour matter for economic inequality (Modern Reason)? 🏦

Over the long period, the return on capital tends to be much higher than the return on labour. ➡ For businesses, the average return on capital exceeds average return on labour, meaning owners of capital amass more wealth compared to workers, thus widening inequality.

## 8. How do monopolies and market share contribute to inequality in modern times? 🛒

A small number of firms survive and dominate a large market share, which allows their profits to grow as their competition declines. ➡ Firms with monopolistic power can pay low wages while earning high profits, contributing further to inequality.

## 9. What is the difference between legitimate and illegitimate means used by firms to survive and grow? 🏢

Legitimate means include providing better quality goods or services, and differentiating their products. ➡ Illegitimate means include influencing government policies to favour them over competition or using unfair trade practices, misusing their position, etc.
