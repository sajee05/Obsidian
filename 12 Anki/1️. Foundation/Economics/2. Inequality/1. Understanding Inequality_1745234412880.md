## 1. What is inequality in the context of social development? 🌍

It refers to differences amongst people or places in the context of various aspects of well-being or development → differences in income, ability to access good education or health facilities, differences in social status, ability to improve one's present condition, differences in opportunities available, etc

## 2. How is inequality objectively measured? 📊

Inequality is measured on the economic parameter of wealth, income and expenditure ➡ Economic inequality is able to capture the differences in various social and political dimensions to a reasonable extent

## 3. Why is wealth-based inequality considered less accurate compared to consumption expenditure-based inequality? 💰

Wealth-based inequality is volatile and less accurate as compared to the consumption expenditure-based inequality ➡ Therefore the usual practice is to use income-based inequality.  
Also, relatively, wealth shows most inequality, then income, then CE. as aaadmi kamaaye jitna bhi, khayega toh similar hi. that's why govt also prefers to use CE based inequality most.
