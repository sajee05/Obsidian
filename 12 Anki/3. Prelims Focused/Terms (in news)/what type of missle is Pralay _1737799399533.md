## Front

what type of missle is Pralay?

<hr/>

## Back

indegenous short-range quasi-ballistic missile.  
  
- **Indigenous** – Developed within the country (Made in India).
- **Short-Range** – Effective within a limited range, typically **less than 1,000 km**.
  
**Quasi-Ballistic** – **Quasi (almost) + ballistic (thrown)**

- **Ballistic Missile** –

  - Follows a **fixed curved path (parabolic trajectory)** like a thrown stone.
  - Moves **mostly under gravity** after launch.
  - **Easier to track and intercept**.
- **Quasi-Ballistic Missile** –

  - **Partially follows a ballistic path** but can **change direction** mid-flight (maneuverability).
  - Uses **aerodynamic controls (use air's friction)** for maneuverability (ability to change direction).
  - **Harder to intercept** due to unpredictable movements.

- **Missile** – A guided projectile designed for precision strikes.
  
**Example:** **Pralay Missile** (India) is quasi-ballistic, meaning it can alter its path to avoid enemy defenses.
