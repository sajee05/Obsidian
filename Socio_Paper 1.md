The focus is to explain the meaning of phenomena instead of how they came in to existence<br>        - Meanings are not fixed and hence there cant be an objective fact<br>        - Every meaning depends on context (called indexicality)<br>        - Human beings attach meaning to phenomena in not a mental action but based on some “typifications (good bad, moral immoral) and depends on culture which finally creates social reality -> no objective idea ( Alfred Shutz in his phenomenology of the social world)<br>            - This was in contrast to Edmund Husserl who claimed classification of phenoema was a purely product of human mind<br>        - Purely qualitative data collected to understand diff objects, events, inst, object etc<br>        - Despite each ind having diff world view and meanings, social world/ order exists only because all of us have commonly agreed over few things<br>        - Eg marriage in Bihar (pakadhwa) vs church wedding in US<br>        - But even social order commonly agreed between members is also an illusion and not objective facts<br>        - Bracketing is a methodological tool used in phenomenology.<br>        - eg – data on crime , poverty (poverty rates diff by diff committees), exports -> opinion of investigator and not objective<br>        - questions even official data eg – GDP change base year<br>        - _P is required to explicate (explain) the concept which positivists take as granted in order to measure them (Hussrel)_<br>        - Eg – Cicourel’s study of juvenile justice ; police and juvenile officers had the problem of classifying the behaviour of juveniles into the categories: delinquent and non-delinquent. Cicourel did not find this process to be objective: it largely depended on the stereotypes of the ‘typical delinquent’ held by the official<br>        - Criticism – questions v existence of socio + too susbjective and common sensical<br><br>Extra<br><br>- - - Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann – no reality other than subjective reality of individuals<br>        - Gabrielle Farina in her “Some reflections on the phenomological method” – it is nether a docrine nor a philosophical school but a style of thought where investigator can have different experiences and results each time<br>        - Create theories<br>        - Enhance research methods<br>        - Shutz: positivism not considered with socio but made out of socio<br>    - Ethno – Harold Garnfienkel – study from people perspective and not investigator perspective using a documentary<br>        - Phenological research to explain how members create order in society<br>        - There are socially constructed rules of everyday interaction.<br>        - Members of society are repeatedly performing these rules and maintain social order (Document of Rules)<br>        - But the social order is an illusion<br>        - Garfinkel introduced “Breaching experiment” to prove illusion -> disrupt the social order and record the reaction of members<br>        - On recording the reaction of members, it is found members become desperate to restore the original social order, which shows that social order is not naturally out there but a construction of the members following the rules of everyday interaction<br>        - Lodger experiment – ask mom for food bill<br>        - Focus on what people do instead of what people think as in P<br>        - Critique – labelled as traditional or folk methodology<br>        - Alvin Gouldner – E focused on trivial aspects of life which everyone is aware of<br>    - Symbolic interactionism – GH Mead and Herbert Blumer<br>        - Philosophy that explains social world as a set of symbols exchanged between members<br>            - Humans are endowed with cognitive thought/ cognition<br>            - Cognitive though is developed through social interaction<br>            - Social interaction involves exchange of signs, symbols, gestures<br>            - Meanings behind everything are created and shared through language<br>            - Social order is possible only because of exchange of symbols and mutually agreed meaning of symbols<br>            - Eg – unfurling flag or burning flag<br>    - Dramaturgy – by Goffman – philosophy which explains socio world is a theatre and members are performers<br>        - Each member performs a role in everyday life<br>        - Role is performed acc to status<br>        - Role performance is done in front stage<br>        - Members prepare for role keeping expectation of audience<br>        - Member is ideal in back stage<br>        - Every member resort to role distance is to be taken seriously in some context (sometimes become informal – off script)<br>        - Every member is doing impression mgt<br>        - Eg – Delta airlines -> air hostess offers service + smile (emotional labour concept)<br>- Post positivism<br>    - Philosophy which critiques and refines positivism -> doesn’t reject<br>    - Quanti + quali data -> eg – unemployment rate plus experience<br>    - Researcher has some value as they are also humans<br>    - Quantitative method of research eg survey + qualitiatve method such as interview (esp unstructured)<br>    - Triangulation method<br>    - Karl Popper + Thomas Kuhn

Abstract concepts and ideology: Critical social research use abstract concepts such as housework, but<br><br>goes beyond simply carrying out empirical studies based on such concepts.<br><br>o Critical research tries to get beneath the surface of social reality. Distorted ideological beliefs may<br><br>be related to dominant classes or to patriarchal or racist beliefs.<br><br>o They mask the material reality that lies behind these beliefs. But critical social research involves<br><br>trying to overcome the dominant ideology or ideologies.<br><br>2. Totality, structure and history: Each abstract concept and particular belief cannot be examined in<br><br>isolation. According to Harvey it is necessary to relate each bit of a society to a totality.<br><br>o Harvey says: Totality refers to the view that social phenomena are interrelated and form a total<br><br>whole.<br><br>o Critical social scientists see societies as possessing structures. Structures constrain or limit what<br><br>people can do, but also make social actions possible. Structures, though, are not static; they<br><br>change.<br><br>o Studies of society therefore need to be related to particular historical contexts. One needs to<br><br>examine how particular societies have changed over time in order to understand them at any<br><br>particular point in time.<br><br>3. Deconstruction, essence and reconstruction: Critical social researchers proceed through a process of<br><br>deconstruction and reconstruction.<br><br>o In the process of deconstruction, the different elements of particular areas of social life are taken<br><br>apart in order to try to discover an essence. The essence is the 'fundamental concept that can be<br><br>used as the key to unlocking the deconstructive process'.<br><br>o Reconceptualization - thinking of familiar aspects of social life in unfamiliar ways - is the key to<br><br>discovering essences through deconstruction. This process is never finished. The process of<br><br>deconstruction does not follow a pre-set path, as laid down by, for example, positivists.<br><br>o Deconstruction leads to reconstruction. The researcher aims in the end to 'lay bare the essential<br><br>relationships that are embedded in the structure'. They develop theoretical insights that allow the<br><br>phenomena under investigation to be seen in a new way.<br><br>4. Praxis: Critical social research is not just a theoretical activity; it is also a form of praxis.<br><br>o Harvey defines praxis as 'practical reflective activity. Praxis does not include "instinctive" or<br><br>"mindless" activity like sleeping, breathing, walking, and so on, or undertaking repetitive work<br><br>tasks. Praxis is what changes the world.".<br><br>- For Marxists, subject matter is peasants, poor, vulnerable, marginalized

Every researcher has one sided understanding of social world which only explains his model of world. He should clearly state that he is only studying model of the world<br>- Robert Bierstedt – defines objectivity as conclusions derived from investigation are independent of race, caste, colour, nationality and political predisposition of investigator<br>- Multiple sources of subjectivity incl<br>    - Choice of topic and problem definition . weber argues subjectivity can be tolderated at

dimensions<br>- Phenomenologists like Shutz – subject matter has consciousness and Hussrel – socio research can not be value free<br>- Gunnar Myrdal - - total objectivity is an illusion which can never be achieved<br>- Also, lose reformist agenda<br>- Alvin gouldner – Value neutrality is an elusive goal in sociology as investigators have to deal with multiple layer truth<br><br>Hence desirable

Done through random number generator eg – chits in a class<br>        - Stratified random – process of dividing the group into strata seg gender/ age based and then conducting random sampling within each strata<br>        - Systematic random – select every nth element as starting point and other members are selected after a fixed sampling interval<br>    - Non random<br>        - Convenience: those who are conveniently available to researcher are taken eg – first 30 customers of store<br>        - Voluntary response: a sample based on the ease of respondents. R directly contact the researchers and volunteer themselves<br>        - Purposive: Involves researcher using his/ her judgement to select a sample which is most useful to the purpose of research. Researcher wants to gain detailed knowledge about the specific group and may exclude other groups.<br>        - Snowball: It is used in cases which involves inaccessible or elite strata of society. Researcher gets in touch with a group and that group introduces researcher to another group

The mixing of data types, known as data triangulation, is often thought to help in<br>- validating the claims that might arise from an initial pilot study.<br>- It is a valuable strategy in social sciences to enhance the credibility, reliability, and comprehensiveness of<br>- research findings as given below:<br>- • Gain a more complete understanding: Employing a variety of research methods (qualitative,<br>- quantitative, and others) provides researchers with different perspectives on the same social<br>- phenomenon. For example, Lenin used a mixture of quantitative data tables along with a political economy<br>- analysis of charged words used in his classic research monograph, The Development of Capitalism<br>- in Russia (1898).<br>- • Minimize Bias: Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Triangulation allows researchers<br>- to leverage the strengths of different methodologies and mitigate the potential biases inherent in any<br>- single approach.<br>- o For instance, in “Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste,” Pierre Bourdieu<br>- integrated qualitative methods with quantitative analysis to mitigate biases inherent in singular<br>- methods.<br>- • Increased confidence in findings: Replication of results across different methods strengthens the<br>- reliability of findings. If various approaches consistently yield similar conclusions, it increases<br>- confidence that the findings are not simply an artefact of the chosen method.<br>- • Richer and more nuanced understanding: Triangulation allows researchers to capture a more<br>- complete picture of the social phenomenon under study.

| Weber (father of modern socio)                                                                                                                             | - Sociology is a science which attempts at **interpretive understanding of social actions** to arrive at explanation of cause and effect<br>- Bridged gap between positivism (use of scientific methods) and idealism (Kant<br><br>Social action<br><br>- First developed in “Economy and society”<br>- An action with a meaning attached by actor, oriented towards others and taking into account the behavior of others<br>    - Meaning attached: actor is conscious of his actions and has some motivation to take it. Values don’t have an independent impact on the actor but are interpreted by the actor to undertake action<br>    - Oriented towards others, which may be physically or mentally present.<br>- Understand cause and effect – basis of sociology<br>    - 4 types of **Ideal types** **of social action**<br>        - Rationality -> orientation to reality which weighs means and ends for purpose of efficacy<br>        - Affective – meaning is generated due to emotional response dedicated by the mind of the actor<br>        - Traditional – meaning due to cultural beliefs and traditions -> reacts automatically to habitual stimuli which guides in course of repetition or belief<br>        - zweck rational – action with logical means to achieve logical end -> by well calculated logic and plan<br>        - wert rational – value oriented rational actions - driven by value of society<br>        - eg – why actor (SRK/ Kapoor family/ bring social change/ earn a lot)<br>        - No action is a pure action. In reality, every action is muddled. So ideal type can help understand theoretical pure types not found in reality<br>- Weber rejected methods of natural science and developed his own methods in “Methodologies for Social Science”<br>- Verstehen (to interpret) – translate to human understanding (MOSS)<br>    - First by Dilthey but interpretivism by Weber and simmel<br>    - Foundation of most of Weber’s work and one of his key contributions<br>    - Human understanding which involves comprehending at the level of actor by following systematic simple steps<br>    - Investigator should reconstruct the actor’s situational choices and constraints<br>    - He should be at the same wavelength with the actor<br>    - He should have no sympathy to actor or situation; maintain objectivity in his investigation<br>    - He should interact with actor to get primary sources of data<br>    - This can maximise the probability to understand true meaning behind an social actions<br>    - Meaning can be drawn via two observations (Eco and soc): direct observation (where meaning is clearly visible and understand by physical characteristics of the act and the external world eg shouting) or explanatory observation (investigator draws meaning by explaining the situation and constraint – puts the act in a context and assigns a motive to it) eg – wood to sell or fire<br>    - Based on the idea that meaning precedes social act. Weber study of “meangingful conduct”<br>- Causal Pluralist method – rejected the mono-causal theory for social actions, and said there are multiple causes leading to a social action. Focus should be on identifying the probable causes (Probabilistic theory) to understand meaning of social actions.<br>- Ideal types: 2nd most important contribution by Weber, which involves developing abstractions to understand complexity of social world by focusing on certain traits of an item<br>    - one sided **mental category** which highlights features deemed essential by researcher<br>    - **It is not a description of reality in itself but a way to express reality – it is not a pure type**<br>    - **Lachman: Act as measuring rod to understand actual phenomenon. These are heuristic devices**<br>    - Weber agrees there are regularities in societies, but these regularities are in the mind of the actor. The actor has subjective interpretation of these regularities<br>    - Used for comparison, building hypothesis and **limited generalization**<br>    - Ideal type tries to understand meanings in term of **regularities** and differences<br>    - Helps in giving objectivity to research<br>    - **Ideal types are formed by a number of elements, which may or may not be directly observable and hence are identified by subjective understanding of the investigator**<br>        - They are neither description nor hypothesis of reality but can help in description or explanation<br>        - Often used to general phenomena that occur at diff times and places<br>        - Aim – look at society objectively without bias – nth to do with values<br>    - Ideal types can be used in 3 categories: Historical particular, Abstract phenomena (such as social action or authority), particular behaviour (such as economic/ pol behaviour of supply demand )<br>    - benefits<br>        - Gives a ready framework for investigators to understand meanings<br>        - saves time<br>        - helps in forecasting<br>        - establish linkages amongst distinct social phenomenas (such as Protestant ethics and capitalism)<br>    - Used in **Economic and social organization, city and sociology of religion**<br>    - **Susan jones – helped socio become a separate discipline**<br>    - **Criticism -> difficult to understand the true meaning without context + bias of investigator**<br>        - **Ignored latent meaning**<br>    - **Examples of ideal type today**<br>        - **Capitalism – std, free market, profit motive – but in reality, sate intervention**<br>        - **Democracy – equality, representation, no unfair practices (diff types across world)**<br>        - Family – middle class happy family (cereal family) – actual neolocal , diff features in diff families<br><br>Authority – essay 1922<br><br>- Power is an aspect of social relationships<br>- Power is chane to influence others even against their will/ resistance and regardless of the basis on which opportunity rests<br>- He elaborate his study in context of power in history of society what called “Herschaf – authority”<br>- **Chance or probability** of command being obeyed by **group of people** is authority<br>- Power has an element of coercion also, where authority is a form of legitimate power<br>- Elements of authority<br>    - Master/ ruler or a group of masters/ rulers<br>    - Ind/ group that is ruled<br>    - Will of ruler is expressed through commands<br>    - Evidence of influence of rulers in compliance<br>    - Direct/ indirect evidence that rulers commands need to be obeyed<br>- Patterns of authority have changed over time. 3 types of authority –<br>    - Traditional: authority **obeyed due to belief in traditions**, customs and values.<br>        - To make traditional authority more palatable, he made 3 ideal types within the ideal type<br>        - Gerontocracy – rule of elderly eg gram panchayat (no staff)<br>        - Patriarchalism eg fater, father in law, maternal uncle (no staff)<br>        - patrimonialism : elderly men with proper staff for administration (eg -Parliament)<br>    - Charismatic:<br>        - Authority obeyed due to belief in charisma of a person<br>        - Eg – religious, political, business (eg – steve jobs), edu (Divyakranti)<br>        - Defines as a certain quality of an individual by virtue of which he is considered **extraordinary** and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman or atleast specifically **exceptional** powers or qualities<br>        - from personal traits of the leader. The person ceases to be leader if followers doesn’t find him charismatic. This can lead to revolution and is more prominent during a crisis. Hence, its usually short lived during the time of crisis - “devotion to exceptional sanctity, heroism, or exemplary character of an individual person and of order revealed or ordained by him<br>    - legal rational: authority obeyed due to belief in legal rules and legislation.<br>    - Component used<br>        - Ideal type<br>        - Social action (affective is charismatic)<br>        - Power and authority<br>        - Causal pluralism – eg social action are not unique – necessary and sufficient causes<br>        - Elective affinity : connection drawn between 2 ideal types eg-> traditional SA and traditional authority; protestant ethics and capitalism<br>    - eg – college (dean), school (princi), office (director), sports club (coach)<br>    - in reality, no authority is pure type. They are all approximate types<br>    - people may obey authority due to multiple reasons. However, task of interpretive socio is to understand the change in patterns of command - obedience<br><br>Rationalization<br><br>- Change in the way people are thinking from traditional to rational ways<br>- This historical evolution visible in changing form of social action and changing form of authority<br>- So social action goes from affective to traditional to wert rational to zweck ration<br>- Authority from traditional to charismatic to legal rational authority<br>- Processes/ events which shaped -> scientific revolution, enlightenment, French revolution (common people) -> no of votes<br>- Industrial revolution -> standardization and meritocracy – everything is well established and standardized<br>- Example: number of marks is the focus, short notes for efficiency, well standardized criteria (1-12, then Ug), std currciculum<br>- Example – food industry: more food items at less cost, food in min time(efficiency in cons), standardized protocol<br>- Example – media – 1 min 100 news, Inshorts – cons of news efficiently, standard template for news<br>- one authority may change into another such as routinization of charisma or traditionalization of rationality<br>- Features of revolution<br>    - Efficiency<br>    - Calculability<br>    - Standardization – well patterned<br>    - Human will be considered as cases<br><br>Bureaucracy<br><br>- - Analyzed through his approach of ideal type<br>    - Secondary group which is organized to complete tasks efficiently (sec means impersonal)<br>    - Weber def of bureaucracy – “hierarchical org designed to coordinate work of many individuals in the pursuit of large scale administrative tasks and org goals most commonly used in modern society<br>    - bureaucracy is the most rational form of legal rational authority (Water)<br>        - - Hierarchical in nature<br>            - Impersonal<br>            - Rules based<br>            - No scope for improvisation<br>            - Position Cannot be appropriated<br>            - Staff is trained according to the requirement<br>            - Efficiency of highest degree<br>            - Different from bureaucrats, who are just positions in the bureaucracy social structure<br>            - Each admin official Specialized DOL and responsibility in their area of expertise<br>            - recruitment on merit<br>            - benefit of predictability and efficiency<br>        - found in both public and private sector for efficient completion of tasks<br>        - Modernization creates **hedonists without hearts and specialists without spirits**<br>        - While it is an appropriation of reality (ideal typical representation not completely capture the living reality) , modern societies are moving towards this type of bureaucracy<br>        - However, it may lead to “iron cage of rationality”, where rationality becomes so dominant that individual creativity of the person is restricted, leading to alientation<br>            - Can lead to dictatorship<br>            - It is rule bound and no space for human values<br>            - Cannot supersede chain of command and personally doesn’t have any power<br>            - Will lead to dehumanization and rationalization<br>        - Counter: may industries which run on creative ideas and don’t have strict rules (Blau study – also marketing industry, coding, music, ABP by NITI ayog, role of thics in governance, mission karamyogi)<br>        - Robert Michels (Political parties) – iron law of oligarchy -> will aim to preserve their power and org becomes a goal in itself. So become conservative<br>            - Demo seems inconceivable w/o organization but in reality, org is the death knell of democracy<br>        - Other concerns – disenchantment, dictatorship of officials, red tapism (ritualism)<br>            - Power gets concentrated in hands of a few minority to get task competed<br>        - George ritzer – mcdonaldization to explain increasing mechanization<br>    - Criticism<br>        - Blau – rules don’t maximise efficiency. Instead informal settings exist within formal bureaucracy that can max efficiency due to red tapism<br>        - Goldner – bureaucratization depdenednt on type of work.. predictable job -> bureaucratic org; unpredictable -> absence of hierarchy<br>        - Henry Mintzberg<br>            - Diff types of bureaucracy – simple (in shopkeeper), machine, divisional (global level – regions eg MCd), professional (schools, clg, music club), adhrocracy (temp form like movie – also Avin Toffler)<br>        - Burns and Stalker – said also organic bureaucracy which is bottom up not top down<br>        - Has inefficiency and red tapism<br><br>Rationalization of bureaucracy<br><br>- - Bureaucracy evolved due to European climate<br>        - Define intellectual forces in Europe and impact like rationality and effieicny<br>        - As a result bureaucracy evolved over time<br><br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|<br>\|- - - Historical\|- - - industrial\|<br>\|- - - Patrimonial bureaucracy\|- - - Rational\|<br>\|- - - Loyalty defines selection\|- - - Merit defines selction\|<br>\|- - - Leader is nation and bureaucrats serve leader\|- - - B serve nation\|<br>\|- - - Public position for pvt end\|- - - Strict separation\|<br>\|- - - Effieicny wasn’t the most imp – human needs were more imp\|- - - Efficiency was more imp\|<br><br>- - - Shift from patrimonial to industrial bureaucracy shows historical experience of Europe<br>        - Monarchs had patriarchal bureaucracy whereas they have legal rational now<br>        - B is now concerned with max goods in min time<br><br>Protestant ethics and capitalism<br><br>- Not directly challenge marxist belief that eco infra to social superstructure.

So they started working hard (leading to rise of capitalism)<br>- Parallel rise of charismatic leaders also helped in development<br>- Dual variables exist for rise of capitalism – spirit and substance<br>- Helped by substance – tech and skills<br>- Elective affinity of protestants that it led to rise of capitalism<br>- “Religion of China” – Confucius ethics believed in collectivism/ harmony and not individualism, which is not in line with spirit of capitalism<br>- Religion of india - Similarly for Hindus, caste barriers in form of Karma and that worldly activity is not important for afterlife – no spirirt<br>- Ancient Judaism – no substance<br>- Observing dedication towards work makes God happy<br>- Gunnar Myrdal – similar lines – Indian archaic inst that hindered growth of economic society<br>- Diff from Marxist capitalism<br>    - Not based on exploitation but religious beliefs and uncertainty of salvation<br>    - Not alienation but motivation<br>    - Modern cap applies rational means to profit for a rational end<br><br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|<br>\|Fact\|Value\|<br>\|Industrial rev in England and Netherlands\|PE – work is ethic\|<br>\|Majority were protestant\|<br>\|Wealth grew enormously in these pockets\|<br>\|Availability of RM\|<br>\|State supported and eco happiness\|<br><br>Weber vs Durkheim<br><br>- Social action vs social fact<br>- Positivist vs non positivist<br>- Synthetic vs formal school<br>- Can be explained by one grand theory was abstract representations<br>- Macro theory vs interpretative sociology<br>- Structural functional approach to understand solidarity whereas verstehen to explain social actions<br>- Weber tries to establish a connectivity between nomothetic and idiographic enquiries<br>- Mono-causal theory vs pluralist and probalistic theories<br>- Philosophical romanticism vs realist to establish facts and theories<br>- Religion to explain collective efferversnce vs religion to explain capitalism (hisotical.

| Talcott Parsons<br><br>VALUE CONSENSUS IN SOC MAINTAINED BY AGIL FRAMEWORK AND A PRE-REQUISITE FOR SURVIVAL OF SOCIETY<br><br>Neo structural functionalist | - Parsons analyzed and criticized the existing schools of thought as follows<br>    - Utilitarians – studied the social world in a highly individualistic fashion ; however they focus on individual choice and miss the collective<br>    - Positivists believed that laws of society can be observed as natural scines using empiricism and generalization ; they overlook the role of values and norms<br>    - Idealists – believed ideas/ consciousness is the basis of all social reality; they focus on values but miss out of external pressures of society<br>- Father of structural functionalism, esp in America with his grand functional theories, while considering micro aspect of social action<br>- He saw society as a social system comprising of sub systems with actors having unique functional pre-requisites<br>- Society evolves from easy to complex forms<br>- He rejected Hobbes view that man functions out of fear – instead he believed value consensus is the integrating force of society and motivates man to undertake roles<br>- Motive of socio is to understand how this value consensus is reached<br><br>Social action (Structure of social action)<br><br>- An act done consciously is social action. 4 elements<br>    - Act in a social situation<br>    - Orientation towards attainment of a goal<br>    - Regulated by norms and values<br>    - Investment of energy<br>- The orientation may be motivational (**cognitive** – see envt in relation to their need, **cathectic** – based on emotional attitude of the actor towards object, **evaluative** – evaluate the optimum efficiency) taking into account needs and plans or value orientation (**appreciative** – judge emotional response, **cognition** – judge validity of judgement, **moral** – what is the right thing to do)<br>    - Motivational arise due to personal condition of actor<br>    - Value orientation rises due to value and norms of society<br>- Three types of social action:<br>    - Instrumental (similar to Zweck rational social Action) – where evaluative motivation is dominating<br>    - Expressive – appreciative value component<br>    - Moral – value orientation is dominant – you are working according to societal norms<br><br>![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 30.png>)<br><br>- - Ideal type of classification of social action, modes of orientation and social system is pattern variable<br>    - Parsons categorically classified human actions and society to expressive orientation and instrumental orientation<br>    - Expressive orientation had emotional expression, personal relationships vs instrumental orientation involves prioritize individualism, achievement of goals and rules and fulfilment of responsibilities<br>    - 6 types of dichotomies possible ADAPCO<br>        - Affective vs affective neutrality – A is quality of expressing one’s emotions eg – at home or romantic relationship, need affectivity whereas no expressive emotion in workplace<br>        - Diffuseness vs specificity – D is a quality of multiple roles played by a single individual vs well defined roles by specialized individuals eg mother plays a diffused role whereas a teacher when only be a teacher in school<br>        - Ascription vs achievement<br>        - Particularism vs universality – P is giving preferential treatment to individuals on basis of expressive ties. Vs U is equal treatment to everyone irrespective of personal ties-> special privilege to a friend (individual as unique vs same – impartial and fair)<br>        - Collectivity vs self orientation : see himself as apart of bigger whole vs independent<br>        - Eg – In India no tradition to modernization but modernization of tradition eg – caste based political party, secularism of India<br>        - It is the affinity between mode or orientation and subsystem that define social order of society<br>        - Helps in<br>            - Understanding modern institutions eg education schools with achievement based and universal<br>            - Understand conflict between traditional and modern orientation eg caste based reservation and caste based meritocracy<br>            - Understand changing roles in family eg in family traditional roles like mother expressive, as feminization - > mother enters workforce – nuclear families<br>            - But Eurocentric based on binary – Asian as modernization of traditional insittuions<br>    - Tonnies also follows similar type of social system<br><br>Action system and Social system (Structure of social action and The Social system)<br><br>- Action systems don’t exist in real world but are tools to analyze the real world<br>- Social actions don’t happen in isolation but in constellations of social actions of individuals known as action systems. 4 Types of action systems<br>    - Culture system – consisting of beliefs, norms and values; “storehouse of information”; Inspired by **Malinowski**<br>    - Social system – actual interaction of various units in society. Institutionalized roles create social system<br>    - Personality system – internal and hidden aspect of society driven by motivations such as love, anger, tension sress alone; inspired by **Mead**<br>    - Organismic system : biological/ physical aspect of society; called the storehouse of energy<br>    - These are not real world but tools for analysing the real world<br>- Institutionalized social structure called social system<br>- Wanted to study how the norms and values of a system are transmitted to actors within the system<br>- Conditions for conception of a social system<br>    - There should be a social interaction between 2 or more individuals<br>    - For achievement of some collective goal<br>    - There is a consensus on role expectation<br>    - They develop an abstract boundary around them<br>- While each system maintains its boundaries and are distinct, Social system is linked to other system and influence each other through **knowledge flow and energy flow, which is called cybernetic hierarchy of control**<br>    - CHC is achieved by socialization and social control<br>    - Socialization is the transmission of valyes from one gen t another via school or fam<br>    - Social controls discourage deviance and various inst enforcing it are law/ police etc<br>- Social system consists of plurality of individual actors interacting with each other, in a situation which has an environment with actors who are motivated in terms a tendency to optimization of gratification<br>- Hence social system has a structure (units/ family/ kinship etc) and functions (performance leads to gratification and attainment of common goals)<br>- Functions/ characteristics of a social system include:<br>    - Social system should have a structure<br>    - Should be supported by other system<br>    - Should meet significant need of its members<br>    - Should have a language<br>    - Should have a system to affress any disruptive behaviour<br>- Developed structural functional theory in phases<br>    - Social equilibrium is the state of balance both internally amongst social phenomena and to external environment<br>    - Requisites functional phase (Social structure): Functions of AGIL framework need to be fulfilled for survival of any society/ structure<br>        - Adaptation (economic system): need for survival production of goods and services by controlling resources in envt. eg – father earning<br>            - Fulfilled by organismic system<br>        - Goal attainment: political system performs this function to define, energize, motivate, mobilise actors to achieve a common goal – determine the goal and achieve the goal<br>        - Integration: by social institution to maintain harmony and resolve conflict– coherence, solidarity and coordination in system<br>        - Latency: needs fulfilled by by cultural systems – need for socialization and cultural learnings eg- family, religion, school<br>    - However, certain factors cause strain in the system.<br>        - Eg – demographic issues eg – pop, migration, skewed sex ration<br>        - Tech issues – any tech like AI which can displace employees/ cause unemployment<br>        - New ideas like French revolution and enlighten, swaraj , Buddhism<br>        - Physical envt – CC, droughts<br>    - When soc experiences factors causing strain, society develops re-equilibriumating tendency. It means society evolves in a manner that it can deal effectively with a strain<br>    - In this process of adaptation, structural differentiation takes place<br>    - Eg – AI -> law update, edu update<br>    - Structural adaptation – organs of society re-align themselves to address issues at home<br>    - Structural differentiation – process of breakdown of roles of an institution and dev of specialized inst to deal with specific role eg -live ins and dating apps, banks, P2P lending, grants, surrogacy/ IVR, counselling<br>    - Mechanism equilibrium phase (SOSA): When specific mechanisms exist, and satisfy needs, there is an equilibrium. If there is a disruption, feedback is passed back to mechanism for a new equilibrium (this is what he called the moving equilibrium); eg - cybercrime<br>        - “feedback” from the action system to another. Eventually, these new inst will work towards maintaining eq (cybernetic web of control) – hence moving eq.<br>        - Tendency to restore eq in case disturbed because of any change in a social element<br>    - Status quoist – no explanation of dictator, rising inequality (Marxists)<br>    - Parsons believed after adaptation and diff, generalization of values is the automated process<br>    - Eg – edu changes -> we understand its part of system<br><br>- - change is restorative to bring back equilibrium<br>    - Supremacy of structure over individual in society<br>- ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9

Empirical analysis is critical for functional analysis<br>- Also suggested a functional paradigm, a systematic approach, to conduct the functional analysis as he believed current functional theories were based on abstract non empirical works.<br>    - This was an integration of theirie with empirical data and research<br>    - Social item should be in a standardized pattern (not too abstract or too concrete)<br>    - Social context needs to be defined<br>    - General description of social item<br>    - Primary and secondary data should be used<br>    - Manifest functions identified<br>    - Latent functions identified<br>    - Dysfunctions identified<br><br>Middle range theory<br><br>- Acc to Merton, Parsons theory of functional structure was too abstract and didn’t encompass all system of concept. It just provided some general orientation as to what variables should be considered in research . hence it was premature and sterile<br>- “Parsons is trying to be Einstein of socio while socio has not even have a Kepler”<br>- Bridge between raw empiricism and grand theories<br>- Characteristics<br>    - Limited assumptions or generalizations which can be verified<br>    - Use concepts which can operationalize the gap between theory and empiricism<br>- Specific hypothesis followed by empirical evidence to make it concrete instead of grand theories or too specific micro theories<br>- The theories will become more reliable, valid, and rightly organized<br>- Triple alliance theory of theory, data, method<br>- Benefit: empiricism, credibility, testability, reproducibility, reduce time, reduce cost, targeted<br>- Disadvantage: Not specific on what constitutes middle?<br>    - Limited scope of framing universal theories<br>    - Subjectivity<br>    - Fragmentation of knowledge because limited social reality and only after extensive research totality<br>    - Raymond Bound – nth but what science uses in theory building<br><br>![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 32.png>)<br><br>Latent and Manifest functions<br><br>- Social Theory and Social Structure<br>- Earlier functionalists looked at only manifest functions, whereas his theory combined psychological and socio-cultural functions<br>- One is an actual intention of the actor (manifest function – intended, recognized, expected) while other is the unintended function from the action of the actor<br>    - Unintended has Latent function, latent dysfunction, no function<br>- Manifest function is analysed by micro theories, usually non-positivist<br>    - Parsons motivational approach/ inspired by Weber<br>    - Psychological dimension of sociological reality<br>- Latent functions often include dysfunctional or unanticipated functions. The actor is unaware and has impact on social structure. This may need both qualitative and quantitative analysis eg. Class and salve domination, dowry, social media isolation, GAI<br>- Hopi tribes and rain dance illustration (rain but actually integration )<br>- Dysfunctional items may have positive latent functions and negative manifest functions and vice versa<br>- Significance: combined positivist non positivist angles; increased scope of socio<br>- Veblen – used example of conspicuous spending on cars (travel and status)<br>- Differentiated between unintended consequences and latent functions, where LF are one type of unintended consequences (which also have latent dysfunction and no function or dysfunction of an action)<br>- Partial view of realiy<br>- Eg – work from home, reproduction, education,<br>- Critique<br>    - Critics said that when he talked about functional alternative, he really was talking about structural alternatives. Semantic criticism.<br>    - Critics said that his model failed to predict dysfunction causing circumstances.<br>    - A status quoist as with latent functions he had effectively legitimised everything.<br>    - Overemphasis on latent functions, may compromise manifest functions eg one child policy to control national reproduction<br>    - Difficult to identify latent functions eg – purchasing contributes to GDP, helps in capitalism – leads to alienation<br>- PYQ-> unintended consequence vs latent function – eg edu, climate, social media<br>- Eg – exam, select student, creates celebs, suicide rates go up, unemployment, rote learners<br>- Colin Campbell – it is difficult to have clear cut differentiation between latent and manifest; function and dysfunction<br><br>Conformity and Deviance<br><br>- Social Structure and Anomie<br>- Conformity: action with Orientation to social norms and expectations, and within tolerance prescription of society<br>- Deviation: action non-conformity with prescribed norms; reasons for deviation<br>    - Subculture<br>    - Parent deprivation<br>    - Faulty association<br>    - Differential opportunities<br>- Deviance is a result for anomie<br>- Deviation can be positive and rewards (Nobel) or negative and punished (such as crime)<br>- Anomie: Discrepancy between culturally defined goals and structurally available means to achieve them<br>- Gave the **structural strain theory** – individuals feel strain to achieve goals when they don’t have legitimate means to achieve them, which forces them to find alternatives and adopt deviant behaviour- lower class feels the strain more<br>- Eg – **American dream** to work in high end jobs needs education (structural means), which may not be available to all; leads to increased crimes from unemployment – feasibility of jounrye from log cabin to white house<br>- Developed in backdrop of great economic depression<br>- Different types of social actors based on their **adaptive responses**<br>    - Conformist: accepts the cultural goals and the means available to achieve them, irrespective of their utility or fairness (majority pop such as edu)<br>    - Innovator: accepts goal but not the means (scientists or thieves, smuggler)<br>    - Ritualist: accepts means but least concerned about the goal (red tapism, employees)<br>    - Rebellion: nether accepts goal nor means, but creates alternate means and goals eg social reformers – proponent of counter culture<br>    - Retreatist: doesn’t accept CULTURAL goals or legitimate means eg alcoholist<br>- What may be conformist at one time may be deviant for another time.<br>- Every conformist may be deviant at some time and vice versa<br>- Many cultures diverge from each other while defining conformity such as LGBTQ<br>- Even relevant for understanding traffic issues in India – need to reach on time so take illegitimate means – also confirmed by Giddens<br>- Goffman – we all are socially deviant<br>- Criticism theory<br>    - Howard Becker (Labelling theory reconsidered): labelling theory said a person is deviant labelled, not for another group but + he is not deviant, he is labelled deviant<br>    - Taylor and Lemert: People with power define deviance and not cultural norms; they mark them as deviant<br>    - Albert Cohen – may be developed due to a subculture and not just one individual + didn’t take non-utalitarian crimes into account like vandalism<br>    - Country can be deviant eg – Pakistan<br>    - Other reasons than means and goals<br>    - Walter Mills – in lower class communication, delinquency is a learned cult and not anomic reaction to an unattainable goal<br>- Hence, understanding anomies and deviances can help develop strategies to address them and prevent deviant behaviour<br>    - ![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 33.png>)<br><br>Difference between anomie of Merton and Durkheim<br><br>- Both analyzede anomie as a state of normlessness but offered diversified views and perspectives to understand the same<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|Durkheim\|Merton\|<br>\|Failure of society to regulate material desires\|Not from desires but mismatch between structurally available means vs goals\|<br>\|Definition\|Pathological state of normlessness\|Discrepancy\|<br>\|Time period\|Describes times when social controls and no ambitions\|V high American dream\|<br>\|Cause\|Rapid change\|Strain\|<br>\|Result\|Deviant behavior – but temp\|Deviant behvior structural\|<br>\|Solution\|Functional associations will emerge ti foster social integration\|Equitable opportunity\|<br>\|Focus\|Upper class – more suicide current\|More exposed to crime\|<br>\|Typology\|No groups\|Made diff groups - 4\|<br>\|Types of anomie\|Acute (rapid changes) and chronic (gradual)\|Only chronic – gradual\|<br>\|Criticism\|Ignored involuntary unemployment and not ambition driven anomie<br><br>Doesn’t leave scope for innovation for ambitions\|Focused only on lower class crimes<br><br>Didn’t account for differences in skill levels<br><br>Albert cuhan<br><br>Walter mills\|<br><br>Reference group - STSS<br><br>- Contribution to the theory of reference group behaviour<br>- A group against which an individual makes comparisons, to evaluate one achievements, aspirations roles etc.<br>- Leads to a feeling of relative deprivation<br>- Shapes our behaviors, aspirations and perceptions<br>- There is an objective criterion i.e. frequency of interaction.

Mind develops within the social process<br>    - Mind involves thought process oriented towards problem solving<br>    - Self presupposed social process<br>    - Once self is developed, it can be maintained even without social contact<br>    - Reflexitivity – unconsciously put yourself in place of others and act as they act<br>    - With development of self, People can evaluate themselves as they will be evaluated from outside **(Looking glass self theory of Cooley)**. This development of self happens in phases and hence is an **evolutionary process + self helps in internal interaction as well as comm with mind**<br>    - Understand how to do conversation with others – what is being said and what needs to be said next<br>    - Over a period of time we start - Role taking by taking role of others and then looking at oneself (reflexivity)<br>    - This self identity or self awareness takes place as a result of role taking – reflexivity process of how others see us<br>    - Preparatory stage – as an infant, limited social experience and hence no role taking -> mimics without understanding the behavior<br>    - Play stage: when the children take particular roles or discrete others and have limited development of self as they start understanding language; lack a more generalized sense of self<br>        - Eg – doll mother -> understands mother and her are diff – so partial self awareness<br>    - Game stage: when they grow up, they can become self in full sense; take role of all others (generalized others)<br>        - Only when we take role of generalized others, we are complete members of society<br>        - Help in development of organized activities<br>        - We can do abstract thinking and objectivity<br>        - But there are many generalized others in the society, because there are many groups in the society<br>        - As a result each self is different based on the groups it’s a part of<br>        - Hence it s not that there is no individuality and everyone is a conformist<br>    - Most likely do what is expected of them to be done<br>    - Generalized other is the attitude of the entire community<br>    - People try to live up to group expectations<br>    - People put themselves in the same experimental field as they put everyone else<br>- I and me – Dualistic nature of self and relate to social experience.<br>    - Develop social perception, thinking, self consciousness, social interactions<br>    - Thinking is simply an internalized or implicit conversation of the individual with himself, by means of such gestures or it is a conv between I and me<br>    - I – spontaneous, immediate response of individual to others -> less socialized and doesn’t follow reflexivity<br>        - It is unpredictable and creative<br>        - Don’t know I – its surprising<br>        - Leads to novelty, dynamism and helps in developing a definite personality<br>        - Increasing dominance of I<br>        - We try to seek I so that we can understand ourselves<br>        - We are never totally aware of I and know about it only once act has been carried out<br>        - Imp – key source of novelty, shows our values and realism of self – permits us develop a definite personality<br>    - Me – Believe how generalized others see us – performs as conforming self<br>        - Individual acts in the way society expects it to<br>        - Knowledge about society and self<br>        - People learn to see who they are by observing responses of others<br>        - Me is a conventional habitual individual<br>        - Me involves conscious responsibility<br>        - Social self develops with the capacity to take role of others<br>        - Eg – respond as women ->> develop<br>    - Social control is dominance of me over I<br>    - So I prevents society from stagnating, while we ensures conformity and

they look at the success of other achieves – feel life is wasted<br>        - they marry late or don’t marry - workaholics<br>        - in case of church, since social bondage is high – the group gives them strength to survive<br>    - Elderly – less likely to do suicide as they know their years are limited and hence live life more<br>    - Teenagers – more suicide as their attachment and social bondage is weak – solidarity with community is weak<br>    - Man rate more than women- no relation between alcoholism, emotion or drugs – they do that to enjoy life<br>    - Climate and suicide<br>        - Winter – less deaths as more festivals so higher social solidarity<br>        - Ritual is a social battery<br>        - It is not the climate but the ritual estivities that decide rate of suicide<br>    - Rate of suicide is same across traditional and modern societies – it is just that rate of suicide is reported in modern society<br>    - Socio is concerned with rate of suicide and not incident of suicide<br>    - Universal phenomena - certain rate is normal<br>    - Underdeveloped countries have less rate of suicide<br>- Suicidogenic current (suicidogenic impulse) – while individual factors play a role (psychological pre disposition), society plays major rule to push – collective tendencies that dominate the susceptible individuals an catch them in their sweep<br>- **Robert beard** – more suicides in modern society rather than traditional society<br>- Jean Bachelor -> developed individual suicides typology<br>- Once suicide is committed, society Readjust forces to restore normal rate<br>- Solution to suicide<br>    -

A lot of people are dependent on them<br>        - More important positions are paid a higher reward since they have talent and skills which are unique, and its needed to motivate them to service these positions<br>        - They have to sacrifice when they undergo training as some functions are more important than others<br>        - Hence social stratification is inevitable in any society<br>        - Rewards attract as an incentive to attract these people – status, wealth, power<br>        - They don’t question system but accept, creating a value consensus in society<br>        - Relevance in India – NEET, UPSC, SSC - np, as power is a more dominant source of inequality rather than awards + people of same talent get occupy higher position<br>        - Critique<br>            - Melvin Tumin: Opposed David and Moore<br><br>![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 60.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 61.png>)![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Socio_Paper 1 62.png>)<br><br>- - - - Difficult to determine relative importance of positions in an objective manner, talent and mobility<br>            - Rewards are not correlated with importance of position eg – a corporate slave vs chief minister (high importance, low reward) or SRK vs IAS<br>            - It is not the only motivational factor<br>            - If merit was sole criteria, then weaker sec would not have been underrepresented – so No equal opportunity eg UNDP data, IIM has upper class professors<br>            - Dysfunctional because it makes barriers to entry for underprivileged, reducing talent availability<br>            - Lead to maintenance of status quo, even when its dysfunctional and resulting in hostility<br>            - Trainees are not making a sacrifice other than suspended income<br>            - Social stratification is not always unity but prmote conflict – civil liberation movement<br>            - Countered by David moore – judge based on uniqueness<br>            - PINK COLLARIZATION, SOCIAL CAPITAL, STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS, GLASS CEILING, CASTE BASED CONSTRAINTS, POVERTY AND INEQUALITY<br>- Marx<br>    - Strat refers to economic and vertical division in society<br>    - Stratification based on ownership of means and forces of production<br>    - Structure: have/ have nots<br>    - A minority has ownership of resources, leading to oppression of the lower strata who don’t own these resources<br>    - Hence product of dialectical materialism, unequal ownership and subsequent class formation<br>    - Consequence: class struggle<br>    - Universality: end of stratification with communism<br>    - Charles Murray – concept of underclass – people with little bargaining power and at mercy of employer eg minority and women<br>    - Critique<br>        - Social mobility will increase in future, with emergence of welfare state and middle class<br>- Weber<br>    - Saw stratification in a multi-dimensional view of class, status and power called trinitarian model<br>    - Happens because of unequal distribution of property, prestige, power<br>    - Class:<br>        - Defined class as a group of people with similar positions in the economic or market position, because of which they have similar life chances<br>        - Not a community<br>        - Related to unequal distribution of economic rewards<br>        - People with similar life chances have similar class<br>            - Life chance is level of opportunity to access good standard of life<br>        - Based on education and skills and not means of Production ownership<br>        - 4 classes: propertied upper class, property less white collar, petty bourgeoisie, manual workers<br>        - Have different skills and ownership on means of production<br>        - No evidence of polarization – instead middle class will swell (proliferation of MC)<br>        - No difference of community feelings (unlike Marx) – not a homogenous group because diff interests and prestige enjoyed differentiate their collective - consciousness<br>        - No abolition of pvt property – equality not necessary, infact it will take new forms<br>    - Status group<br>        - **Social group awarded similar amount of honor and share same position**<br>        - These are communities<br>        - Can be status group (a group of people enjoying honour from majority of individuals) or status less group<br>        - Related to unequal distribution of honour<br>        - Practice endogamy eg – inter caste<br>        - They follow certain rules and manners<br>        - Pass on same value system to next gen<br>        - Enjoy prestige due to their lifestyle (Refers to way of life chosen by individual)<br>            - Internal to individual – choice is individuals<br>            - Eg – IAS officer 2 sons – each has same life chance but diff lifestyle<br>            - Defines honour inequality in society (lifechance defines eco inequalities in soc)<br>            - Doesn’t necessarily lead to status inequalities<br>        - Eg – president delegation, exclusive clubs like gymkhana, sherpas, brahmans<br>        - Closed status group (closure)<br>        - Possession of property, and resource not always associated with status<br>        - Dependent on multiple factors such as knowledge, occupation, income, honour, social capital etc.<br>        - Consumers of goods and not producers of goods<br>        - Aware of their status eg Brahmins or untouchables<br>        - Traditional societies – ascriptive, modern societies achievement based<br>        - Usually more closed groups and have certain qualifiers for others<br>        - Pakulski and waters – status is becoming more imp than economic class as cons is based on status (eg spending on marriage based on status and not economic capacity)<br>    - Party<br>        - Parties are structures who want to gain power (be at state or non state institution)<br>        - Usually represent class or status groups (not always)<br>        - Parties of patronage and parties of principle<br>    - Hence he concluded power property and prestige not necessarily correlated. Goes against Marxist idea of eco as deterministic factor<br>    - Application<br>        - Socio economic caste census – looks at diff<br>        - Surveys are very comprehensive<br>        - Eg – global gender gap, MDI<br>    - Critique<br>        - Cellia Heller: Status and class often inter related<br>            - Counter – usually bit not always + homo a status group across classes<br>        - Ulrich Beck:<br>            - Risk based stratification - inequality based on risk taking capability<br>            - Induced by modern society such as terrorism, innovation etc<br>        - Marxist – conflict theory<br>        - Feminist – ignores gender stratification<br>        - Runciman – 7 classess and not 4<br>        - CW Mills – new type of power elite<br>    - Illustrations<br>        - Individual with wealth may command little prestige or power eg = lottery, inherit wealth<br>        - Individuals with status may not have wealth eg – social woker, great Thunberg, people who are ascetics<br>        - With status but no power – eg ex PM, e x bureucrats, celebs<br>        - Status could be source of power – media ccelebs, Kangana ranaut<br>        - Wealth could be source of power – ambani<br>    - Reality is **multi dimensional if unit of analysis is individual actor**, class power status may not correlate. This analysis brings us **closer to individuals in every day** life insyead of **Marxian class abstraction**<br>    - **Inspired AB**

The power elite controls major societal decisions.<br><br>Pareto: Elites are characterized by those with superior abilities, whether intellectual, economic, or<br><br>political. Power may be held by those who excel in different spheres, and the elite naturally changes<br><br>over time.<br><br>Mosca: Power is concentrated in the political class, and the ruling minority emerges through<br><br>competition and the ability to manipulate political institutions.<br><br>**Role of Ideas and Values:**<br><br>Mills: Emphasizes the role of shared values and ideas among the power elite in maintaining their<br><br>dominance. The elite class has a cohesive worldview that guides decision-making.<br><br>Pareto: Focuses on the circulation of elites based on their abilities and the emergence of new elites<br><br>with different values and ideas over time.<br><br>Mosca: Highlights the manipulation of ideas and ideologies by the political class to maintain control.<br><br>The ruling minority uses ideologies to justify its dominance.<br><br>**Social Mobility:**<br><br>Mills: The power elite remains relatively stable, with limited social mobility. The interconnectedness<br><br>of the elite class reinforces its stability.<br><br>Pareto: Recognizes the circulation of elites, suggesting that social mobility occurs as different groups<br><br>rise and fall in power.<br><br>Mosca: Acknowledges the possibility of individuals moving into the political class, but the overall<br><br>structure remains characterized by a minority in control.<br><br>**Conflict vs. Stability:**<br><br>Mills: Acknowledges the potential for conflict between the power elite and the wider society,<br><br>highlighting the possibility of tensions and

potential and actual power; local politics is a business of negotiating and bargaining – supported this classical pluralism<br>    - Uunlike classical pluralism, not all groups equally imp – some more imp ; believe state works in interest of elite interest groups<br>- Power is not concentrated with one but dispersed; modern democracies have different sources of power<br>- They don’t reject that elites exist, but say there are other sources of power like pressure groups, trade unions etc.<br>- Hence, elitism is compatible with democracy<br>- Diverse occupations lead to different groups, who bargain and negotiate to influence and shape policies – no one plays a dominant role as conflicting interests amongst different groups<br>- **Alexis de Tocqueville**: state is an honest broker between divergent groups<br>- **Anthony Downs in his “An economic theory of democracy”** : trade unions, pressure groups play similar role in politics to defend interests of their members<br>- **Seen in India

mobility<br>    - Sensitization for caste<br>    - Feminist support – metoo, Nirbhaya walks (but patriarchy)<br>    - Agent of political participation – election manifesto and polling<br>    - New

bringing a change in the existing social order<br>            - **Social movement can be active**, or **outwardly directed to transform society** or **inwardly directed to change people involved**<br>        - Strain theory: developed by Neil Smelser<br>            - where there is a difference between societal norms and structural means, people feel the strain in society<br>            - 6 necessities for development of the strain and a social movement to emerge<br>                - Structural conduciveness – envt of society should be such that certain forms of protest can take place eg not monarch<br>                - Structural strain - which should be due to the structure of current social system – relative deprivation due to inequality eg caste system<br><br>![Socio_Paper 1](<Z9

Precipitating factor – certain event should have happened – spark for collective action<br>                - Mobilization of participants – should have network and org to take the action<br>                - Lack of political control or too much control – how much control do the higher authorities have?<br>            - Social movement emerges in form of stages and believed in a multi-causal theory instead of mono-causation<br>        - Relative deprivation theory:<br>            - when people feel relatively deprived and are unhappy about certain things, they lead to collective action<br>            - criticism: people are often unhappy about certain things, doesn’t mean they always take collective action<br>        - resource mobilization theory (**Mccarthy Zald**, Tilly): **From mobilization to revolution**<br>            - any social movement possible only when material resources to sustain such as knowledge, money, crowd, network, charismatic leader, leadership, media, solidarity, legitimacy mobilized<br>            - if it can muster resources like leadership, comm and funding, they can be more effective<br>            - assumption is resources are scarce and they have to compete for it<br>            - criticism: doesn’t explain movements by farmers and peasants , new movements don’t need resources eg meTOO, arab spring – no resource<br>        - **political opportunity theory (Till and McAdam**)<br>            - movement possible not only with resource but if there is right political opportunity too in the system<br>            - refers to vulnerability of existing political system due to its own weakness, support of opposition or formation of faction within ruling or greater access to public participation through social media<br>        - Wallace: Revitalization theory (revitalization movements)<br>            - While they may arise from dissent/ dissatisfaction of existing social order, they can lead to positive alternatives also<br>            - These are also called positive movements<br>            - Eg – Arya Samaj/ Brahmo Samaj<br>        - Marxists – conflicts resweeten industrial workers and their capitalist employees<br>        -

action to attract media and public<br>    - Bureaucratization: establish own rules and procedures<br>    - Success (eg women)/ failure repression (eg – British/ 144)/ mainstreaming/ cooperation/

and individual actions only eg – ezhava in kerala<br>    - Revolutionary : change in society radically, usually by capturing state power eg – Bolshevik revolution in Russia<br>    - Alternate : limited to individuals only<br>- Functions of social movement (Touraine)<br>    - Mediation – relate individual to larger society an give thema chance to participate and express ideas<br>    -

But all religions were cults. Now use new religious movements used<br>- It is a type of religion which is believed to be established around a charismatic leader believed to possess extraordinary qualities<br>- Types of cults (ACC) – Roy Wallis<br>    - World rejecting – they see outside world as inherently evil and reject mainstream world and encourage followers to detach themselves from mainstream. Eg – people’s temple by Jim Jones, heavens gate, Osho<br>    - World accommodating – unlike world rejecting, don’t reject mainstream and unlike affirming, not obsessed with max potential of individuals eg brahm kumari<br>    - World affirming – they don’t reject mainstream material world, rather show how to extract max by unlocking potential. They promote enjoy life and make them better individuals. More like paid enlightenment similar to SHG eg vipassana, scientology<br>- Another – stark and brainbridge<br>    - Audience cults: least organized – little F2F interaction and passively engaged eg – books, lectures – Sadhguru<br>    - Client cults: more organized, and ongoing relationship between leaders and followers – more like adherents<br>    - Cult movements: satisfy all religious needs of followers<br>    - Satisfy needs of alienated sections of urban middle class youth<br>    - Is v transitory and irregular<br>    - Hence have different cult memberships ( can follow more than 1)<br>    - More in western society, after post war and created counter culture as they are materialistic but anxious<br>- Reasons for new cults<br>    - Provides sense of belongingness – this appeals to individuals who feel isolated or disconnected<br>    - Quick salvation – rapid solution to everyday life problem; Cults provide relief in current life itself, vs religion which provides relief in afterlife<br>    - Provides flexibility<br>    - Heterogeneity<br>    - Personalized services and highly accessible<br>    - To deal with inequalities – women/ lower caste<br>    - Social media influence<br>- So these are voluntary orgs in metropolitans to ease the sufferings in industrial societies<br>- Usually under a charismatic leader, with focus on individual experiences<br>- Trying to find man ki shanti; not really marginalized<br>- Usually a richer person – important clients<br>- V individualistic<br>- No ceoncept of membership or exclusivity<br>- Steve bruce – result of secularization<br>- Stark and Bainbridge: new religions or atleast new in a particular society<br>    - Something may be cult in one place but a religion in another eg ISCON<br>- Reasons for cult<br>    - Conflict in traditional modern society<br>    - Insecurity – both psychological and social<br>    - Inequality – rising inequality<br>    - Change – rapidly changing society, need some anchor in this change for peace<br>    - Free lunches: offered by sects (schools, hospitals)<br>    - Political patronage: offered owing to populist politics<br>- Denomination<br>    - When sect becomes more organized and institutionalized with larger following, it becomes a Denomination<br>    - Denomination is more acceptable in eyes of the church<br>    - Johnson: The line between church and denomination is not v clear, nor is the line between sect and cult is<br>    - Denomination has its own institution, following, ideaoligy and exists in parallel to church ; making it the base of a secular society<br>    - Howard Beckar: a denomination is a sect which has cooled down and become an institutionalized body rather than an active protest group<br>    - They lose their radicalism and dynamism<br>    - Attract people from all stratas (not just marginalized) and are usually in line with norms of society<br>- Church: established institution which generally accepts the norms of society and consider itself the guardian of social order<br>- **ROY WALLIS DIAGRAM**<br><br>**Difference between sect and cult**<br><br>- **In opposition to church eg- protestnt vs in linde eg – Calvinist**<br>- **Closed open**<br>- **Challenge domination eg jain**<br>- **Use forceful conversion vs social media**<br>- **Live vs with die with leader**

countries have disadvantage position in global economic transactions<br>- Eforced a rigid intl DOL<br>- It will always be a story of comparative advantage<br>- Poor countries are behind or catching up not because they didn’t have the enlightenment alue or scientific temper but were coerced to be integrated in the economic system of Europe where they merely exported RM or labour and denied any opportunity to market their own resources (eg British and India)<br>- Undevelopment – no use of available resources<br>- Underdevelopment – resources are used but benefits are with dominant states and not poor states<br>- Poor countries are not catching up, but using resource of developed countries – hence not ever truly free<br>- Need a clear “national interest”<br>- True dev creates

– shared human perception of a reality that already exists<br>    - Invention – creation of new knowledge which can be material or non material<br>    - Diffusion – spread of cultural traits from one to another when soceities/ groups come in contact<br>- Can be heterogenetic (external) such as war, cultural contact, trade etc or orthogenetic (internal) such as stress, innovation, regime change<br>- Scientific factors – Ogburn – cultural lag – tech has an imp role in social change<br>    - Cultural lag means the delay in change in non-material elements after change in material

rational outlook towards dominant beliefs – Parsons studied + changing women edu<br>- Environment – rising extreme weather events<br>- Globalization<br>- S&T – questions, explain, innovates eg contraceptives; but cultural lag<br><br>But not losing significance<br><br>- Political – Ar 377<br>- Religion – NRMs and charismatic personalities<br>- Culture – homogenization, diffusion of yoga<br><br>Digitization as a social change agent<br><br>- Economy – feminization, gig economy (Srineck), alienation and isolation (Blauner), flex working models<br>- Social – informalization, changing kinships (fictive kins), weakening fam bonds (Edmund leach),<br>- Religion – charismatic leaders cults eg sadhguru<br>- Intellectual ideas – westernization and homogenization<br>- Education and health<br>- Media as 3rd face – global citizenship + social movements<br>- Communalism and fundamentalism<br>- Dysfunctions such Rising deep fakes, AI Bias – stereotypes, data privacy (Focault)<br>- Pathological behaviour eg blue whale<br>- Media and civil soc – diigtial news – real time awanreness – Larry diamond<br>- But cultural lag with digitization – Ogburn and nimkoff + Y
