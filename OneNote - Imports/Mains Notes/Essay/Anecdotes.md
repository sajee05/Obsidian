|Democracy|In 1787, as the American Constitutional Convention came to a close, a woman approached Benjamin Franklin and asked, “Well, Doctor, what have we got—a republic or a monarchy?” Franklin famously replied, “A republic, if you can keep it.” His response highlighted a profound truth: systems of government, no matter how well designed, rely on the moral and ethical capacities of the people who govern and are governed by them. Democracy, in particular, requires both the best and the worst of human nature to function.|
|Artificial intelligence (AI) and Ethical Dilemmas|- ==Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of our time.== It is already having a major impact on our lives, and its influence is only going to grow in the years to come. However, with this great power comes great responsibility. AI raises a number of ethical dilemmas that we need to carefully consider before we adopt it on a widespread basis.<br><br>I was recently watching a documentary about self-driving cars. In one scene, the narrator posed a hypothetical ethical dilemma: what would a self-driving car do if it were faced with a situation where it was forced to choose betwee==n hitting a pedestrian or hitting a wall?==  <br>This is just one example of the many ethical dilemmas that are raised by artificial intelligence (AI). As AI becomes more sophisticated and capable, it is important to carefully consider the ethical implications of its development and use.|
|The Revival of Traditional Indian Sports|- I remember when I was a child, I used to play kabaddi with my friends on the street. We would spend hours running around, trying to tag each other and avoid getting tackled. Kabaddi was our favorite sport, and we would often play it until it was too dark to see.<br><br>However, as I got older, I started to play more Western sports like cricket and football. I still enjoyed playing kabaddi, but it was no longer my primary sport. This was a common experience for many of my friends as well|
|Liberal Education is not Antithetical to Technical Education|- ==Abraham Lincoln was a self-taught lawyer. He grew up in a poor family in a log cabin, and he had very little formal education==. However, Lincoln was a voracious reader, and he spent much of his time studying law and other subjects.<br>- ==Steve Jobs, the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc., was one of the most successful and innovative entrepreneurs in history==. He was also a strong advocate for liberal education.<br><br>==In a 1997 commencement address at Stanford University, Jobs sa==id, "I'm a big believer in liberal arts education. I don't believe that technology is the answer to everything. I think that the liberal arts are essential to giving you a broader perspective on life."  <br>Jobs went on to say that his liberal arts education at Reed College helped him to develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that he needed to be successful in business. He also said that his liberal arts education helped him to appreciate the beauty and importance of design.|
|Our Urban Survival Depends upon Efficient Waste Management|- ==I recently visited the capital city of India, New Delhi.

|Paradox of Freedom and Responsibility|==Nelson Mandela was born into a privileged family in South Africa.== He received a good education and became a successful lawyer. However, he was also a vocal critic of the apartheid regime in South Africa. As a result, he was i==mprisoned for 27 years.==  <br>While in prison, Mandela could have easily given up hope. He could have become bitter and resentful. But he didn't. Instead, he used his time in prison to reflect on his life and to develop his ideas about freedom and responsibility.  <br>After his release from prison, Mandela became a leader in the fight against apartheid. He helped to negotiate an end to the apartheid system and became th==e first black president of South Africa.==  <br>Mandela's story is an example of the paradox of freedom and responsibility. On the one hand, he was born into a privileged family and had many opportunities. On the other hand, he was also oppressed by the apartheid regime and had to make difficult choices about how to use his freedom.|
||- ==Consider the story of Viktor Frankl, a Jewish psychiatrist who survived the Nazi Holocaust.== Frankl was imprisoned in several concentration camps, where he witnessed unspeakable horrors. Despite his circumstances, Frankl never gave up hope. He found meaning in his suffering and used his time in the camps to develop his theory of logotherapy, .which is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on helping people find meaning in their lives.<br>- Frankl's story is an example of how ==freedom== is not simply the absence of constraints. ==It is the ability to choose,== even in the most difficult of circumstances. Frankl chose to find meaning in his suffering and to help others do the same.|
|Perils of Ecodegradation|==In the 1970s, the Aral Sea in Central Asia was the fourth-largest lake in the world.== However, due to decades of over-irrigation for agriculture, ==the lake has shrunk by over 90% and is now one of the worst environmental disasters on the planet.==<br><br>- ![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604045422-0.png)<br><br>The ==Aral Sea is a stark example== of the perils of ecodegradation.

|Global Warming and Climate Change|==Recent flash floods in Sikkim, India which were caused due to glacial melting in South Lhonak lake soon flooded Teesta before Chungthang destroying the dam there in minutes.== The floods were caused by unusually heavy rainfall, which scientists believe is linked to climate change.  <br>Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. It is caused by the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and warm the planet. The main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.  <br>Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture, are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result of these emissions, the global average temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius since the pre-industrial era.  <br>Climate change is already having a significant impact on the planet. It is causing sea levels to rise, glaciers to melt, and extreme weather events to become more frequent and severe.|

|Cyberwar|- _It is a_ _fine winter morning in 2035. As_ _commuters travel to work__, the metro rail crashes to a grinding halt._ _Concurrently__, planes in the airspace lose communication with the ground control. Banks report breach of confidential data from their servers. Government websites are hacked with threatening messages splashed all across the screens. The energy and nuclear power plants control systems are infected with strange viruses._ _In 30 minutes,_ _the country’s critical infrastructure collapses and within an hour, it becomes clear that the country has become a_ _victim of a coordinated cyberattack— cyberwar._<br><br>_This scary scenario, confined earlier to sci-fi movies is now a potential reality. With increasing networking and interconnectedness, cyberspace is emerging as a new arena for warfare in the 21st century. How India prepares for this combat is a critical challenge of our times._|
|Climate change|- _Around 1 million plant and animal species are on the verge of extinction, with alarming implications for human survival, according to a Living Planet Report._ _Our natural resources are getting depleted, rains are getting erratic, and the air is turning toxic. The scientific consensus is clear about the cause behind this dangerous trend: carbon emissions from human activities are irrevocably damaging the environment at a rapid pace._ _It’s not climate change anymore. It is a climate emergency._ _This poses an imminent danger to the world, especially to the developing countries like India which have to balance the need for rapid economic growth with reducing carbon emissions._|
|Injustice|- _It was 1893. A bright, young lawyer was travelling first class on a train in the British colony of South Africa. During the journey, a white man objected to his presence in the compartment, despite the lawyer possessing a valid ticket._ _The white man insisted that ‘coloured’ men like him were supposed to ride in the third class and not in the first class. When the lawyer refused to give up his seat, he was thrown off the train. Insulted at this discrimination, the young man resolved to fight injustice with truth and non-violence. He went on to become the force of change he wished to see in the world. He was Mahatma Gandhi._|

||During a hectic project, one of the 70 scientists working on it asked Dr Kalam if he could leave at 5.30 pm that evening as he had promised to take his kids to an exhibition. Dr. Kalam gave him permission. However, the scientist got busy with work only to realise that it was 8.30 pm. When he looked for his boss, he wasn’t there. Guilty for having disappointed his kids, he went back home only to find that his kids weren’t there. When he asked his wife where they were, she replied, “You don’t know? Your manager came here at 5.15 pm and took the children to the exhibition.”|

|Importance of direction|Imagine you're on a big adventure, sailing your own boat. The "port" is like your destination or goal in life.

|If by Rudyard Kipling|If you can keep your head when all about you     <br>    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,     <br>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  <br>    But make allowance for their doubting too;     <br>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  <br>    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,  <br>Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,  <br>    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br><br>  <br><br>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;     <br>    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;     <br>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  <br>    And treat those two impostors just the same;     <br>If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken  <br>    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  <br>Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  <br>    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:<br><br>  <br><br>If you can make one heap of all your winnings  <br>    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  <br>And lose, and start again at your beginnings  <br>    And never breathe a word about your loss;  <br>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  <br>    To serve your turn long after they are gone,     <br>And so hold on when there is nothing in you  <br>    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’<br><br>  <br><br>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,     <br>    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,  <br>If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  <br>    If all men count with you, but none too much;  <br>If you can fill the unforgiving minute  <br>    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,     <br>Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,     <br>    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!|

||In 1997, J.K. Rowling, a single mother living on welfare, had just finished her first manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. After receiving twelve consecutive rejections from publishers, many would have accepted defeat. Instead, Rowling showed the courage to accept her situation and the dedication to improve her writing, refining the manuscript until it was finally accepted by Bloomsbury Publishing. What followed was not only literary success but a global phenomenon that reshaped the publishing world. Rowling’s journey illustrates a powerful truth: the courage to accept and the dedication to improve are two keys to success.|
