#### Options Analysis:

1.  **Statement Correctness (Multiple Choice):** Overwhelmingly dominant format, testing detailed factual knowledge on a wide range of international bodies, agreements, memberships, functions, reports, and historical context. Requires careful parsing of multiple statements. (e.g., Q1 2024, Q2 2023, Q22 2022, Q3 2022, Q4 2022, Q5 2022, Q7 2022, Q19 2021, Q19 2019, Q11 2018, Q15 2017, Q17 2017, Q12 2016, Q14 2016, Q15 2016, Q11 2011).

Options testing "only" or "all" require scrutiny.

#### Options Analysis:

1.  **Matching (Multiple Pairs):** Dominant format testing accuracy across several place-country or place-reason pairings (Q24 2024, Q5 2023, Q6 2023, Q11 2022, Q10 2018, Q11 2018, Q12 2014). Often requires identifying the *number* of correct pairs, increasing difficulty.
2.  **Statement Analysis (Cause/Effect):** Q1 (2024 - Sahel instability/coups), Q3 (2024 - Sumed pipeline role/location) test the relationship and correctness of two related statements.
3.  **Identification (Single Correct):** Requires identifying the correct context/description/location for a specific term or place (Q17 2022 - Levant, Q22 2022 - Lake Faguibine, Q15 2022 - Senkaku dispute, Q7 2023 - Common reason for countries in news, Q15 2024 - Demographic trend).
4.  **Distractors:** Matching questions are highly prone to errors, pairing correct locations with wrong countries/reasons or vice-versa. Statement analysis questions test the logical link between the statements. Identification questions offer plausible but incorrect descriptions or locations.
