(introduced later) significantly increase the need for accuracy across multiple items. Misattributing reports to wrong organizations is a frequent trap.

#### Options Analysis:

1.  **Statement Correctness (Multiple Choice):** Remains the most dominant format, testing factual recall and understanding across a vast array of recent and general knowledge topics. Requires careful scrutiny of details, dates, responsible bodies, objectives, and characteristics.
2.  **Identification (Single Correct):** Frequently used to identify the purpose, context, definition, location, or organization associated with specific terms, schemes, reports, events, or technologies.
3.  **Matching:** Used for pairing awards/criteria, ranks/services, places/reasons, etc.
4.  **Distractors:** High potential for errors due to the sheer volume and diversity of topics. Common distractors include incorrect associations (ministries, organizations, locations), inaccurate timelines or statistics, misstated objectives or features of schemes/initiatives, and confusion between similar-sounding terms or concepts. The "How many statements/pairs are correct?" format significantly increases difficulty.
