#### Options Analysis:

1. **Matching (Multiple Pairs):** Dominant format testing pairings of Wetlands/Lakes/States (Q2 2022), Ports/Features (Q1 2023), Tribes/States (Q18 2013), Features/Reserves (Q17 2013), Highways/Cities (Q15 2014), Shrines/Locations (Q6 2014, Q10 2014), Protected Areas/States (Q14 2014). High probability of errors if knowledge isn't precise across multiple items. Often asks "How many pairs are correctly matched?".
2. **Statement Correctness:** Used for specific features like Barren Island (Q5 2018), Changpa community (Q11 2014).
3. **Identification (Single Correct):** Identifying locations (Q9 2017 - Seawater receding), artificial features (Q6 2018 - Kodaikanal), types of features (Q3 2021 - Saline lakes), geographical separators (Q12 2014 - Ten Degree Channel), or relative positions (Q7 2018 - Longitude).
4. **Calculation/Spatial Reasoning:** Q8 (2017) requires mapping a route and counting states. Q10 (2019) requires ranking states based on forest cover percentage data.
5. **Distractors:** Incorrect pairings in matching questions are the main trap. Statements might contain one incorrect detail (e.g., Barren Island location relative to Gt Nicobar, or eruption status in Q5 2018). Ranking questions (Q10 2019) require relative, not just absolute, knowledge.
