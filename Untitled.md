## Fundamental of Macro Economy
### 1.1 Introduction
#### 1. Define economics and explain its significance in understanding the disparity between resource-rich and resource-scarce countries.
- Economics is the study of how societies use scarce resources.
- It explains how societies produce valuable goods and services.
- It also explains how these goods and services are distributed among different individuals.
- Resource-rich African countries are poor due to inefficient resource exploitation.
- Resource-scarce Japan has high income due to efficient resource use.
- Efficiently exploiting limited resources leads to betterment and development.

#### 2. Differentiate between microeconomics and macroeconomics with suitable examples.
- Microeconomics studies decisions of people and businesses.
- It looks at how individual economic agents allocate resources.
- It also studies prices of goods and services.
- Example: How an individual buys products with given money.
- Example: How a company maximizes production to lower prices.
- Macroeconomics studies the national economy as a whole.
- It examines total investment and consumption in the economy.
- It looks at how central banks manage money and interest rates.
- Example: How Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is affected by unemployment.

| Feature | Microeconomics | Macroeconomics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Individual economic agents (people, businesses) | National economy as a whole |
| **Decisions** | Allocation of resources, prices of goods/services | Total investment, consumption, money management |
| **Examples** | Individual purchasing choices, company production | GDP, unemployment rates, interest rates |

#### 3. How does the UPSC syllabus align with macroeconomic studies?
- The UPSC syllabus is about macro economy.
- It concerns the overall performance of the economy.

### 1.2 Economic Organization (The Three Problems)
#### 1. What are the three fundamental economic problems every society must solve? Explain each with examples.
- Every society must solve three fundamental economic problems.
- These are: what, how, and for whom.

##### What commodities are to be produced and in what quantity?
- A society must decide what goods and services to make.
- It also decides when they will be produced.
- Example: Will we produce pizzas or shirts today?
- Example: Will we produce many consumption goods (pizzas)?
- Or fewer consumption goods and more capital goods (pizza machines)?

##### How are the goods to be produced?
- A society must decide who will do the production.
- It determines what resources will be used.
- It also decides what production techniques will be used.
- Example: Who does the farming and who teaches?
- Example: Will factories be run by people or robots?

##### For whom are the goods to be produced?
- This asks who gets to eat the fruit of economic activity.
- It questions if income and wealth distribution is fair.
- Example: How is the national product divided among households?
- Example: Do many people stay poor while a few are rich?

#### 2. How do societies balance the production of capital goods and consumption goods? Discuss with examples.
- Societies must decide between consumption goods and capital goods.
- Consumption goods meet immediate needs, like pizzas.
- Capital goods, like pizza-making machines, boost future production.
- Producing more capital goods means fewer consumption goods today.
- But it leads to more production and consumption tomorrow.
- This balance is crucial for future economic growth.

### 1.3 Economic Systems
#### 1. Compare and contrast market, command, and mixed economies with examples.
- Societies organize through different economic systems.
- These systems allocate scarce resources.

##### Market Economy
- Individuals and private firms make major decisions.
- Decisions are about production and consumption.
- A system of prices, markets, profits, and losses guides choices.
- Firms produce for highest profits (what).
- They use least costly techniques (how).
- Consumption depends on spending wages and property income (for whom).
- Example: United States.

##### Command Economy
- The government makes all important decisions.
- Decisions are about production and distribution.
- Government owns most means of production (land, capital).
- It directs enterprises and tells workers their jobs.
- It decides how output is divided among people.
- Example: Soviet Union.

##### Mixed Economy
- All modern societies are mixed economies.
- They have elements of both market and command systems.
- Most decisions are made in the marketplace.
- Government plays an important role in overseeing the market.
- Governments regulate economic life and produce public goods.
- Example: Most developed and developing economies today.

| Feature | Market Economy | Command Economy | Mixed Economy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Decision Maker** | Individuals and private firms | Government | Market and Government |
| **Ownership of Production** | Private | Mostly government | Both private and public |
| **Resource Allocation** | Prices, profits, incentives | Government commands | Combination of market and government |
| **Example** | United States | Soviet Union (historically) | Most modern societies |

#### 2. What is a laissez-faire economy? How does it function in a market system?
- A laissez-faire economy is an extreme market economy.
- In it, the government keeps its hands-off economic decisions.
- Decisions are made by individuals and private firms.
- A system of prices, markets, profits, and losses determines what, how, and for whom.

#### 3. Why do modern economies prefer a mixed economic model?
- No contemporary society fits purely market or command categories.
- All societies are mixed economies, combining both elements.
- Most decisions are market-driven.
- Government plays an important role in overseeing the market.
- Governments regulate economic life.
- They also produce public goods like education and police services.

### 1.4 Four Sectors of Economy
#### 1. List the four sectors of the economy and describe the role of each.
- A mixed economy is divided into four sectors.

##### Private Sector
- Includes enterprises owned by private individuals or groups.
- Their basic function is production of goods and services.

##### Government Sector
- Includes public administration, police, and defense.
- It frames and enforces laws.
- It imposes taxes and spends on infrastructure, healthcare, education.
- It also undertakes production through Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).

##### Household Sector
- Consists of people who normally live together.
- They take food from a common kitchen.
- These people work in firms and earn wages.
- They work in government departments and earn salaries.
- They are owners of firms and earn profits.
- All human beings (population) belong to this sector.

##### External Sector
- Consists of exports and imports of goods and services.
- It includes financial flows into and out of the country.

#### 2. Differentiate between the private and government sectors with examples.
- The private sector consists of enterprises owned by private individuals.
- Example: Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL).
- The government sector includes public administration and PSUs.
- Example: Coal India Ltd. (CIL), National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).
- Private sector's basic function is production of output.
- Government sector provides public services and undertakes production.

#### 3. Explain the household sector's contribution to economic production and consumption.
- Households provide factor services like entrepreneurship and labor.
- They earn wages, salaries, and profits from these services.
- Households consume the goods and services produced.
- They spend their income to purchase these goods and services.

#### 4. How does the external sector impact the national economy?
- The external sector involves exports and imports of goods and services.
- It includes financial flows from and into the domestic country.
- Exports bring foreign money into the country.
- Imports mean money flows out of the country.
- These flows impact the national economy's balance of payments.

### 1.5 Private Sector
#### 1. What are the factors of production? Explain the role of each in economic output.
- To produce output, any enterprise requires inputs.
- These inputs are broadly divided into four categories.
- They are called the four "factors of production" or "inputs of production".

##### Entrepreneur
- The person who takes the risk to start a new business.
- Brings together capital, labor, and natural resources.
- Expects "Profit" in return.
- The entrepreneur is a human being from the household sector.

##### Capital
- Includes physical assets like buildings, machinery, equipment.
- From an economic view, only physical capital goods are considered.
- The return for capital is called "Interest".

##### Natural Resources
- Includes land and raw materials.
- These are naturally available and not man-made.
- The return for natural resources is called "Rent".

##### Labour
- Refers to human labor, which can be physical or mental.
- It can be unskilled, semi-skilled, or skilled.
- When labor is provided, the return is "wages".
- The laborer is a human being from the household sector.

![INDIAN ECONOMY by VIVEK SINGH 7th EDITION_unlocked](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/INDIAN ECONOMY by VIVEK SINGH 7th EDITION_unlocked 2.png>)

#### 2. How does the private sector utilize resources like labor and natural capital for production?
- The private sector utilizes labor by employing human beings.
- Labor can be physical or mental, unskilled, semi-skilled, or skilled.
- In return for labor, the private sector pays "wages".
- Natural capital includes land and raw materials.
- The private sector uses these naturally available resources.
- It pays "Rent" for the use of natural resources.
- These resources are combined with entrepreneurship and physical capital.
- This combination helps produce desired goods and services.

### 1.6 Types of Goods
#### 1. Differentiate between intermediate goods and final goods with examples.
- Intermediate goods are semi-finished products.
- They need further processing to become final goods.
- Example: Steel sheets, which become automobiles.
- Final goods do not undergo further transformation.
- They are consumed by ultimate consumers or used as capital.
- Example: A car purchased for home use (consumption good).
- Example: A tractor used in farming (capital good).

| Feature | Intermediate Goods | Final Goods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Processing** | Require further processing | Do not undergo further transformation |
| **Usage** | Inputs for further production | Consumed by ultimate consumers or used as capital |
| **Example** | Steel sheets, tea leaves for a seller | Automobiles, tea leaves for home use |

#### 2. Classify final goods into durable consumption goods, non-durable consumption goods, and services, providing examples for each.
- Final goods are consumed by ultimate consumers.
- They meet the immediate need of the consumer.

##### Durable Consumption Goods
- These goods do not get exhausted immediately.
- They last over a period of time, generally more than 3 years.
- Examples: Home appliances, consumer electronics, furniture.

##### Non-Durable Consumption Goods
- These goods get consumed immediately.
- Their life is generally less than 3 years.
- Examples: Cosmetics, food, fuel, paper, clothing.

##### Services
- Services are intangible.
- They are a kind of consumption good.
- They are consumed immediately.
- Examples: Education, banking, telecom, healthcare.

#### 3. How do capital goods differ from consumption goods? Provide examples of dual-purpose goods.
- Capital goods are produced durable outputs of a man-made process.
- They act as inputs for further production processes (to be sold).
- They do not get transformed or consumed while acting as input.
- Example: A tractor used to produce agricultural products.
- Consumption goods are consumed by ultimate consumers.
- They meet the immediate need of the consumer.
- Example: Food, clothing.

##### Examples of Dual-Purpose Goods
- A particular good can be both a consumption and a capital good.
- Example: A washing machine used at home is a consumption good.
- The same washing machine bought by a laundry service is a capital good.
- Example: A car bought for home is a consumption good.
- A car bought by "Ola Cabs" for transportation services is a capital good.

*Diagram: Goods and Capital*
*   **Financial and Intellectual Capital**: Intangible assets like money, patents, and copyrights.
*   **Physical Capital**: Tangible assets like machinery and equipment used in production.
*   **Capital Goods**: Durable outputs used as inputs in production, not transformed or consumed.
*   **Consumption Goods**: Goods consumed by ultimate consumers, categorized into durable, non-durable, and services.
*   **Intermediate Goods**: Semi-finished products requiring further processing to become final goods.

### 1.7 Investment
#### 1. What constitutes gross investment in an economy? How is it related to GDP?
- Gross investment is the part of final output comprising physical capital goods.
- It is measured as the portion of GDP consisting of capital goods.
- Example: If GDP is Rs. 1000 and capital goods are Rs. 300, gross investment is Rs. 300.
- It is also called Gross Capital Formation.
- Gross Capital Formation includes fixed capital formation, valuable metals, and inventory changes.

#### 2. Explain the concept of net investment with an example.
- Net Investment is Gross Investment minus Depreciation.
- Depreciation is the wear and tear of physical capital.
- Example: Gross investment is Rs. 300.
- If depreciation is Rs. 50, net investment is Rs. 250.
- It represents the actual addition of capital goods to the economy.

#### 3. Discuss the relationship between household savings, investment, and economic growth.
- If households save, the same value of capital goods is produced.
- Higher household savings lead to greater production of capital goods.
- Greater production of capital goods means higher investment.
- Higher investment propels the economy on a higher growth path.
- More capital goods help increase future production of goods and services.
- Example: India's savings increased from 5% to 28% of GDP.
- This led to increased capital goods production and higher growth.

### 1.8 Circular Flow
#### 1. What is the circular flow of income in a two-sector economy? Explain its components.
- The circular flow of income shows how money moves in an economy.
- It assumes only a private sector and a household sector.
- Households provide factor services (entrepreneur, labor, capital, natural resources).
- Enterprises use these inputs to produce goods and services.
- Enterprises pay factor payments (profit, wages, rent, interest) to households.
- Households spend this income to purchase goods and services from enterprises.
- This money flows back to enterprises, completing the circle.
- The aggregate value of goods and services moves circularly.

![INDIAN ECONOMY by VIVEK SINGH 7th EDITION_unlocked](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/INDIAN ECONOMY by VIVEK SINGH 7th EDITION_unlocked 4.png>)

#### 2. How does saving by households affect the circular flow of income and capital goods production?
- If households save, they spend less on consumption goods.
- Enterprises then produce fewer consumption goods.
- They produce more capital goods instead, equal to the amount saved.
- Saved money (e.g., in banks) is borrowed by other enterprises.
- This borrowed money is used to purchase the capital goods.
- This increases the production of capital goods in the economy.
- More capital goods lead to increased future production of goods and services.
- Higher savings result in higher investment and economic growth.

![INDIAN ECONOMY by VIVEK SINGH 7th EDITION_unlocked](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/INDIAN ECONOMY by VIVEK SINGH 7th EDITION_unlocked 5.png>)

#### 3. How does the absence of a government and external sector simplify the circular flow model?
- The model assumes no government and no external sector.
- This simplifies the flow to only private and household sectors.
- It means no taxes or government spending.
- No exports or imports are considered.
- In this simplified model, savings directly equal investment.
- All goods produced are either consumed or become capital goods.

### 1.9 Gross Domestic Product
#### 1. Define GDP and explain its importance in measuring economic activity.
- GDP is the total final value of goods and services produced.
- It is produced within a country's domestic territory.
- This is measured in a specified time period, usually a financial year.
- It is important for measuring the aggregate economic activity.
- It shows the total production of final goods and services.

#### 2. How is GDP calculated using the value-added, expenditure, and income methods?
- GDP can be calculated by three methods.

##### Value-Added Method (Product Method)
- Sums the value of all goods and services produced by all firms.
- Value added by a firm is its production value minus intermediate goods used.
- Example: Farmer's value added + Baker's value added = Total GDP.

##### Expenditure Method
- Sums expenditures by all four sectors on final goods and services.
- Sectors include household (C), private (I), government (G), and external (X-M).
- Formula: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M).
- C, I, G are expenditures on domestically produced final goods.

##### Income Method
- Sums the incomes received by all four factors of production.
- These incomes are profit, interest, rent, and wages.
- Formula: GDP = Profit + Interest + Rent + Wages.
- This reflects the distribution of revenue from production.

*Diagram: Gross Domestic Product*
*   **Income Method**: This method calculates GDP by summing the incomes received by factors of production.
*   **Product Method**: This method calculates GDP by summing the value of all goods and services produced.
*   **Expenditure Method**: This approach calculates GDP by adding expenditures from household, government, private, and external sectors.

#### 3. Discuss the significance of each method in understanding economic dynamics.
- The value-added method shows contributions from different economic activities.
- It highlights the productivity of various sectors.
- The expenditure method reveals how different sectors contribute to demand.
- It shows consumption, investment, government spending, and net trade.
- The income method indicates how national income is distributed.
- It shows the shares of profit, interest, rent, and wages.
- All three methods should yield the same GDP value.
- They offer different perspectives on economic dynamics.

### 1.10 GDP Calculation Methodology by NSO
#### 1. What are the components included in GDP calculation under the value-added method?
- NSO calculates GDP by Value Added Method.
- It includes value addition from various economic activities.
- These are: Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing.
- Mining and Quarrying.
- Manufacturing.
- Electricity, Gas, water supply and other utility services.
- Construction.
- Trade, Hotels and transport, and communication and services related to broadcasting.
- Financial, Insurance, real estate and professional services.
- Public administration and defence and other services.

#### 2. How does the expenditure method capture the economic activities of various sectors?
- The expenditure method adds up various components of spending.
- It includes Private (Final) Consumption Expenditure (household spending).
- Government (Final) Consumption Expenditure is also included.
- Gross Fixed Capital Formation (investment by private and government) is added.
- Net of Exports and Imports (X-M) captures external sector activity.
- This method shows total spending on domestically produced final goods.

#### 3. Why do discrepancies arise in GDP calculations by the NSO?
- GDP measured by different methods should ideally be equal.
- Discrepancies arise due to unreliable data.
- Especially, reliable data for private consumption expenditure is often unavailable.
- The difference is usually listed as "discrepancies" in the expenditure approach.

### 1.11 Macroeconomic Variables
#### 1. Differentiate between GDP and GNP. How does Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA) influence their calculations?
- GDP measures production within a country's domestic territory.
- GNP measures output/earnings made by a country's residents.
- NFIA is the factor income earned by domestic factors abroad.
- It also includes factor income earned by foreign factors in the domestic economy.
- GNP is calculated as GDP + NFIA.
- NFIA influences GNP by adding or subtracting foreign earnings.

#### 2. What is the significance of National Disposable Income in macroeconomic analysis?
- National Disposable Income is National Income + Transfer payments.
- It represents the total income available to a country for consumption or saving.
- It includes income from production and transfers (like remittances).
- It is significant for understanding a nation's total spending capacity.

#### 3. How are macroeconomic variables like NDP and NNP calculated?
- NDP (Net Domestic Product) is calculated from GDP.
- NDP = Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - Depreciation.
- NNP (Net National Product) is calculated from GNP.
- NNP = Gross National Product (GNP) - Depreciation.
- NNP is also called Net National Income or National Income.

*Diagram: Macroeconomic Variables Relationships*
*   **NDPFC** + (Indirect Taxes - Subsidy) -> **NDPMP**
*   **NDPMP** + Depreciation -> **GDP**
*   **GDP** + NFIA -> **GNP** (Gross National Income)
*   **GNP** - Depreciation -> **NNPMP** (National Income or Net National Income)
*   **NNPMP** - (Indirect Taxes - Subsidy) -> **NNPFC**

*Formulas:*
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) + NFIA = Gross National Product (GNP)
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - Depreciation = Net Domestic Product (NDP)
Gross National Product (GNP) - Depreciation = Net National Product (NNP)

### 1.12 Nominal and Real GDP
#### 1. Define nominal and real GDP. Why is real GDP preferred for measuring economic growth?
- Nominal GDP measures growth in value, including quantity and prices.
- Real GDP measures growth in quantity only.
- Real GDP is preferred for measuring economic growth.
- This is because it removes the effect of price changes (inflation).
- It shows the actual increase in goods and services produced.

#### 2. How is the GDP deflator used to adjust nominal GDP into real GDP?
- The GDP deflator is the ratio of Nominal GDP to Real GDP.
- Formula: GDP Deflator = Nominal GDP / Real GDP.
- It reflects the overall inflation in all goods and services produced.
- To get Real GDP, Nominal GDP is divided by the GDP deflator.
- This adjusts for price changes, showing true output growth.

#### 3. What role does the base year play in calculating real GDP?
- To calculate Real GDP, prices of a specific year are kept constant.
- This specific year is declared as the base year.
- For example, India's base year for GDP calculation is 2011-12.
- Real GDP for any year uses quantities of that year and prices of the base year.
- This allows for comparison of output across years without price distortion.

### 1.13 Productivity, Capital Output Ratio, and ICOR
#### 1. What is the difference between average and marginal productivity? Provide examples.
- Average productivity is total output divided by total input.
- Example: 2 tonnes of production from 5 laborers means 0.4 tonnes/laborer.
- Marginal productivity is the change in output from adding one more unit of input.
- Example: Adding one extra laborer increases production by 0.2 tonnes.
- This means marginal productivity of labor is 0.2 tonnes/laborer.

#### 2. Explain the Capital Output Ratio (COR). Why is a lower ratio beneficial for the economy?
- Capital Output Ratio (COR) is the ratio of capital to output.
- Formula: COR = Capital / Output.
- It measures how much capital is needed per unit of output.
- A lower ratio is beneficial for the economy.
- It means less capital is required to produce one unit of output.
- This indicates higher efficiency of capital.
- Example: COR of 3/1 (Rs. 3 capital for Rs. 1 output) is better than 4/1.

#### 3. Define Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) and discuss its relationship with economic growth and investment.
- Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) measures additional capital needed.
- It shows how much additional capital is required to produce one additional unit of output.
- Formula: ICOR = (Change in capital / Change in output).
- It represents how efficiently new capital is used.
- A lower ICOR means more efficient use of new capital.
- Investment % in GDP = ICOR x % change in GDP.
- A lower ICOR allows for higher economic growth with less investment.
- Or, it can achieve the same growth with less investment.
- ICOR depends on governance, labor quality, education, skills, and technology.

### 1.14 Potential GDP
#### 1. What is potential GDP? How does it differ from actual GDP?
- Potential GDP is the real value of goods and services.
- It can be produced when a country's factors of production are fully employed.
- It is the maximum sustainable level of output an economy can produce.
- Actual GDP is subject to business cycle swings (upturns and downturns).
- During a downturn, actual GDP falls below potential.
- During an upturn, actual GDP rises above potential.

#### 2. Why is achieving potential GDP essential for sustainable growth?
- Achieving potential GDP means high utilization of labor and capital.
- It indicates the economy is producing at its maximum sustainable level.
- This is essential for sustainable growth.
- It ensures efficient use of available resources.
- Potential GDP growth depends on inputs and technological efficiency.

### 1.15 Nominal, PPP, and Real Exchange Rates
#### 1. Define nominal, purchasing power parity (PPP), and real exchange rates.
- **Nominal Exchange Rate (NER)**: Price of one currency in terms of another currency.
- Example: $1 = Rs. 70.
- **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Exchange Rate**: Compares prices of the same basket of goods in different countries.
- It shows how much of one currency is needed to buy what a unit of another currency buys.
- Example: If a burger costs $1 in US and Rs. 35 in India, PPP is $1 = Rs. 35.
- **Real Exchange Rate (RER)**: Measures trade competitiveness between countries.
- Formula: RER = Nominal Exchange Rate / PPP Exchange Rate.
- It indicates how much goods in one country cost compared to another, in common currency.

#### 2. How does PPP adjust for differences in price levels between countries?
- PPP adjusts by comparing the prices of an identical basket of goods and services.
- It determines the exchange rate at which the purchasing power is equal.
- This means a given amount of currency buys the same volume of goods in both countries.
- It removes the effect of different price levels when comparing economies.

#### 3. What is the significance of real exchange rates in trade competitiveness?
- Real exchange rate (RER) indicates a country's trade competitiveness.
- If RER is less than 1, domestic products are cheaper and more competitive.
- If RER is greater than 1, domestic products are more expensive and less competitive.
- When a currency appreciates in real terms, its trade becomes less competitive.
- When a currency depreciates in real terms, its exports become more competitive.
- RER helps understand the true cost of goods for international trade.

### 1.16 GDP, Welfare, Development, and Human Capital
#### 1. Why is GDP not a perfect measure of welfare? Discuss its limitations.
- GDP measures total market value of goods and services produced.
- It does not claim to measure welfare, wellbeing, inequality, or happiness.
- Limitations:
    - It does not include its **distribution** (how wealth is shared).
    - It does not account for **externalities** (like pollution).
    - It excludes **activities at home** (unpaid household work).
    - An economy can have rising inequality, pollution, yet rising GDP.
    - It is a proxy for welfare but not designed for this task.
    - It needs to be complemented with broader indicators for wellbeing.

#### 2. Explain the relationship between GDP, human development, and human capital.
- **Economic Growth (GDP)**: Increase in a country's capacity to produce goods and services.
- **Economic Development**: Broader concept, reflects social and economic progress.
- Economic growth is necessary for development but not sufficient.
- Development includes better health, education, infrastructure, poverty reduction.
- **Human Capital**: Human resources (like students) turned into productive assets (engineers, doctors).
- It considers education and health as means to increase labor productivity.
- **Human Development**: Based on the idea that education and health are integral to well-being.
- It focuses on people's ability to read, write, and lead healthy lives.
- Higher human capital can lead to higher income growth.
- Higher income can also lead to building high levels of human capital.

#### 3. How can GDP growth lead to development and welfare improvements?
- GDP growth is a vital condition for development.
- It can lead to development by increasing per capita income.
- It can provide better health and education facilities.
- It can improve infrastructure.
- It can help reduce poverty and generate employment.
- Growth can also enable governments to raise more resources.
- These resources can be used for public services and social safety nets.

### 1.17 World Bank and IMF Classification of Countries
#### 1. How does the World Bank classify countries based on income levels?
- The World Bank classifies economies based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.
- This is based on nominal exchange rates.
- **High Income**: GNI per capita > $13,205.
- **Upper Middle Income**: $4,255 < GNI per capita < $13,205.
- **Lower Middle Income**: $1,085 < GNI per capita < $4,255.
- **Low Income**: GNI per capita < $1,085.
- India belongs to the "Lower Middle" group.

#### 2. What are the IMF's criteria for classifying countries? How do they differ from the World Bank's approach?
- The IMF classifies the world into two major groups:
    - Advanced economies.
    - Emerging market and developing economies.
- IMF's classification is based on three parameters:
    - Per capita income (using PPP exchange rate).
    - Export diversification.
    - Degree of integration into the global financial system.
- **Difference**: World Bank uses GNI per capita (nominal exchange rate) primarily.
- IMF uses per capita income (PPP exchange rate), export diversification, and global financial integration.

### 1.18 Inflation Indices
#### 1. What are inflation indices, and why are they important in economic analysis?
- An inflation index is a tool used to measure the rate of inflation.
- It measures the relative change in the level of prices over time.
- It is important in economic analysis to track price rise.
- It helps understand changes in purchasing power.
- It is used to measure average price increases for a basket of commodities.

#### 2. Differentiate between the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- **CPI** measures price changes paid by ultimate consumers in retail markets.
- **WPI** measures price changes in wholesale markets, where goods are traded in bulk.
- CPI includes inflation in services, while WPI does not.
- CPI focuses on a basket of goods consumed by retail people.
- WPI tracks prices the producer gets at factory gate/mandi levels.
- WPI includes prices of goods only, not services.
- CPI includes the impact of indirect taxes.

| Feature | Consumer Price Index (CPI) | Wholesale Price Index (WPI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Measures** | Change in prices paid by ultimate consumers in retail market | Change in prices in the wholesale market |
| **Includes Services** | Yes | No |
| **Published By** | National Statistical Office (NSO) | Office of Economic Advisor, DPIIT |
| **Base Year** | 2011-12 | 2011-12 |
| **Weight of Food** | 45.86% (combined) | 24.4% |
| **Includes Indirect Taxes** | Yes | No (tracks basic prices devoid of taxes) |

#### 3. How do inflation indices affect monetary policy decisions?
- Inflation indices are crucial for monetary policy decisions.
- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses CPI-Combined as its inflation target.
- The target is 4% with a band of +/- 2%.
- If inflation is outside this band for three consecutive quarters, RBI is deemed to have failed.
- This triggers a report to the government explaining reasons and remedial actions.
- Inflation indices guide RBI in setting policy rates like the repo rate.
- They help RBI manage money supply to maintain price stability and support growth.

*Diagram: Understanding Inflation Indices*
*   **GDP Deflator**: Compares nominal and real GDP
*   **Consumer Price Index**: Measures retail price changes for consumers
*   **Wholesale Price Index**: Tracks wholesale price changes for producers

## Money and Banking - Part 1
### 2.1 Introduction
#### 1. Define money and explain its role in economic transactions.
- Money is an intermediate "commodity" necessary to smoothen transactions.
- It is acceptable to both parties in an exchange.
- It must be limited in supply and difficult to get.
- Role: It acts as a medium of exchange.
- It facilitates buying and selling of goods and services.
- It helps overcome the problem of "double coincidence of wants" in barter.

#### 2. How has the evolution of money shaped the modern economy?
- Initially, barter exchanges were cumbersome.
- Gold and silver became money due to limited supply.
- Problems arose with physical gold (supply not keeping pace, carrying heavy gold).
- Paper slips (currency notes) backed by gold emerged, issued by trusted persons (RBI).
- RBI now issues notes backed by other assets (government securities, foreign currency).
- Commercial banks were created as a layer between RBI and public.
- This evolution facilitated transactions for increasing goods and services.
- It made the financial system more manageable and efficient.

#### 3. Why is money considered a medium of exchange and a measure of value?
- Money acts as a medium of exchange because it facilitates transactions.
- Individuals can sell their produce for money and use money to buy other goods.
- Money acts as a convenient unit of account.
- The value of all goods and services can be expressed in monetary units (e.g., Rs. 300 for a book).
- This allows for easy comparison and calculation of value.

*Diagram: Dynamics of Money Supply and Prices*
*   **Constant Money Supply**: Price changes depend on output variations
*   **Decreased Money Supply**: Can cause price decreases if output is constant or increasing
*   **Increased Money Supply**: Leads to potential price increases if output is constant or decreasing

### 2.2 Functions of Money
#### 1. What are the primary functions of money? Provide detailed examples.
- Money plays three important roles/functions.

##### Medium of Exchange
- This is the most important role of money.
- It facilitates exchanges and transactions.
- Example: A farmer sells rice for money, then uses money to buy wheat.

##### Unit of Account
- Money acts as a convenient unit of account.
- The value of all goods and services can be expressed in monetary units.
- Example: A book is valued at Rs. 300, meaning it can be exchanged for 300 units of money.

##### Store of Value
- Wealth can be stored in the form of money for future use.
- Money is not perishable and has low storage costs.
- It is acceptable to everyone at any point in time.
- Example: Saving money to buy something later.
- If prices rise steeply, money's purchasing power erodes, compromising this function.

#### 2. How does money act as a standard of deferred payment?
- The provided text does not explicitly define "standard of deferred payment" as a function of money.
- However, it states that money acts as a "store of value" for future use.
- This implies that money can be used to settle debts or payments in the future.
- Money's universal acceptability makes it suitable for future obligations.

#### 3. Explain the secondary functions of money with real-world applications.
- The provided text does not explicitly categorize functions as "primary" and "secondary".
- It lists "medium of exchange," "unit of account," and "store of value" as the three important roles/functions.
- Therefore, based on the provided text, I cannot explain secondary functions.

### 2.3 Exchange Rate Systems
#### 1. What are the different types of exchange rate systems? Provide examples of countries adopting each.
- Exchange rate systems determine currency values.

##### Fixed and Adjustable Exchange Rate System
- A country fixes its exchange rate to another currency.
- It adjusts (devalues or revalues) the currency when needed.
- Example: India till 1993 ($1 = Rs. 1 in 1947, adjusted to Rs. 31 by 1993).

##### Floating Exchange Rate System
- Currency value depends on market forces of demand and supply.
- The central bank does not manipulate it.
- **Free Float**: Central bank never intervenes. Example: US, Japan.
- **Managed Float**: Central bank sometimes intervenes to manage volatility. Example: Indian Rupee.

#### 2. Compare and contrast fixed, floating, and managed exchange rate regimes.
- **Fixed and Adjustable**:
    - Government/central bank sets the rate.
    - Rate is adjusted (devalued/revalued) by authorities.
    - Used to correct balance of payment issues or inflation.
- **Floating (Free Float)**:
    - Currency value determined purely by market demand and supply.
    - Central bank does not intervene.
    - Example: US Dollar.
- **Managed Float**:
    - Currency value is market-determined.
    - Central bank intervenes occasionally to reduce volatility.
    - It does not aim to set a specific price band.
    - Example: Indian Rupee.

| Feature | Fixed and Adjustable | Floating (Free Float) | Managed Float |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Control** | Government/Central Bank fixes and adjusts | Market forces (demand/supply) | Market forces, with Central Bank intervention |
| **Intervention** | Direct and deliberate adjustments | No intervention | Occasional intervention to curb volatility |
| **Example** | India (before 1993) | US, Japan | Indian Rupee |

#### 3. How does the exchange rate impact inflation and trade balances?
- **Impact on Trade Balances**:
    - Devaluation/depreciation makes exports cheaper.
    - This can increase exports and improve trade balance.
    - It also makes imports costlier, potentially reducing them.
    - Appreciation makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper.
    - This can worsen trade balances.
- **Impact on Inflation**:
    - Depreciation can lead to inflation.
    - Imported goods become more expensive, increasing costs.
    - This can contribute to cost-push inflation.
    - Appreciation can help reduce inflation by making imports cheaper.

### 2.4 Securities
#### 1. What are the various types of securities available in financial markets?
- Securities are financial instruments that promise future return.
- They are tradable.
- Securities are broadly categorized into two types:
    - Equity security.
    - Debt security.

#### 2. Explain the difference between equity and debt securities with examples.
- **Equity Security (Stock/Shares)**:
    - Represents ownership in a company.
    - Holders receive profit/dividend and capital gains.
    - Entitle holder to some control (voting rights).
    - Example: Shares of "XYZ Pvt. Ltd." purchased by an owner.
- **Debt Security**:
    - Represents borrowed money that must be repaid.
    - Defines amount borrowed, interest rate, and maturity date.
    - Holders receive interest and principal repayment.
    - Example: Bonds issued by "XYZ Pvt. Ltd." to individuals.

| Feature | Equity Security | Debt Security |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | Ownership in a company | Borrowed money (loan) |
| **Return** | Profit/Dividend, Capital Gains | Interest, Principal Repayment |
| **Control** | Entitles holder to some control (voting rights) | No control over the company |
| **Example** | Shares/Stocks | Bonds, Debentures |

#### 3. Why are securities essential for mobilizing financial resources?
- Securities allow companies to raise funds from investors.
- Equity securities enable investors to become owners, providing capital.
- Debt securities allow companies to borrow money at fixed interest rates.
- They facilitate investment in companies and projects.
- Securities are tradable, providing liquidity to investors.
- This mobilization of resources helps companies expand and grow.

### 2.5 Government Securities
#### 1. What are government securities, and how do they function as risk-free investments?
- A Government Security (G-Sec) is a tradable instrument.
- It is issued by the Central Government or State Governments.
- G-Secs carry practically no risk of default.
- Hence, they are called risk-free gilt-edged instruments.
- This is because the government is highly unlikely to default on its payments.

#### 2. Discuss the role of Treasury Bills in government borrowing.
- Treasury bills (T-bills) are short-term debt instruments.
- They are issued by the Government of India.
- Their maturity is less than one year.
- T-bills are zero coupon securities, meaning they pay no interest.
- Instead, they are issued at a discount and redeemed at face value.
- They are used by the government for short-term borrowing needs.
- T-bills are traded in the money market.

#### 3. How do dated securities differ from bonds issued by the government?
- Dated securities are basically long-term securities.
- They are issued by the Central Government.
- They generally have a tenor of 5 to 40 years.
- They can be fixed-rate, floating-rate, or inflation-indexed bonds.
- Special securities (like oil bonds) and bank recapitalization bonds are also dated securities.
- The text uses "bonds" as a general term for debt securities, and "dated securities" specifically for long-term government bonds.
- So, dated securities are a type of bond issued by the government with a specific maturity date.

*Diagram: Government Securities (G-Sec)*
*   Treasury Bills (GoI)
*   Cash Management Bills (GoI)
*   Dated Securities (GoI)
*   State Dev. Loans (State Govt.)

### 2.6 Corporate Bond Market in India
#### 1. What is the significance of the corporate bond market in India?
- A deep and liquid corporate bond market makes India less vulnerable.
- It supplements the banking system for long-term capital.
- It provides a stable source of finance for the corporate sector.
- This is crucial for large resource requirements, especially for infrastructure.

#### 2. How does the corporate bond market support infrastructure development?
- Infrastructure development requires large amounts of resources.
- The corporate bond market can provide a stable source of finance.
- It supplements bank lending for long-term capital investment.
- This helps meet the significant funding needs for infrastructure projects.

#### 3. What are the challenges and solutions for deepening the corporate bond market in India?
##### Challenges
- Few corporate entities meet transparency and governance standards.
- This creates a gap between demand and supply of corporate bonds.
- Public offering of bonds is expensive and time-consuming.
- Corporates find it easier to borrow from banks or use private placement.
- Non-availability of bankruptcy laws (historically) hindered investor protection.
- Building required infrastructure for the market is costly and time-consuming.

##### Solutions
- Government has raised Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) ceiling limit to 15% in corporate bonds.
- Government is framing an investor charter for rights, responsibilities, and grievance redressal.
- Creation of a ‘backstop facility’ to purchase investment-grade bond/debt papers.
- This facility would operate in both stressed and normal times.

### 2.7 Financial Markets
#### 1. What is the role of financial markets in the economy?
- Financial markets bring buyers and sellers together.
- They trade in financial securities or assets.
- Examples: stocks, bonds, derivatives, currencies.
- They facilitate the flow of funds between savers and borrowers.
- They play a critical role in effective transmission of monetary policy.

#### 2. Differentiate between primary and secondary markets. Provide examples.
- **Primary Market**:
    - Where securities are created and sold for the first time.
    - Transaction is between the issuer (company) and the investor.
    - Example: A company selling new shares in an Initial Public Offering (IPO).
- **Secondary Market**:
    - Where previously issued securities are traded among investors.
    - The issuer (company) is not directly involved in these trades.
    - Example: Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).

| Feature | Primary Market | Secondary Market |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | Creation and first sale of securities | Trading of previously issued securities |
| **Involvement** | Issuer (company) and investor | Investors among themselves |
| **Purpose** | Raise new capital for the issuer | Provide liquidity to investors |
| **Example** | Initial Public Offering (IPO) | Stock exchanges (BSE, NSE) |

#### 3. How do money markets differ from capital markets in terms of instruments and maturity?
- **Money Market**:
    - Trades financial instruments with high liquidity.
    - Maturities are very short, less than one year.
    - Instruments are basically debt instruments.
    - Examples: Treasury Bills, Commercial Paper, Certificate of Deposits.
- **Capital Market**:
    - Trades debt and equity securities.
    - Maturities are generally medium and long term, more than one year.
    - Examples: Stocks, bonds.

| Feature | Money Market | Capital Market |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maturity** | Less than one year (short-term) | More than one year (medium to long-term) |
| **Liquidity** | High liquidity | Lower liquidity compared to money market |
| **Instruments** | Debt instruments (e.g., T-bills, Commercial Paper) | Debt and equity securities (e.g., Stocks, Bonds) |
| **Risk** | Less risky | More risky |

### 2.8 Types of Company
#### 1. What are the key differences between public and private companies?
- **Private Company**:
    - Number of members is limited to 200.
    - There is restriction on the transfer of shares.
    - Shares are not available to the general public.
    - Owned and exchanged privately.
- **Public Company**:
    - A company which is not private.
    - Its securities (shares/bonds) can be traded on a stock exchange (listed).
    - Or its securities are not traded on any stock exchange (unlisted).

#### 2. How are companies classified based on liability? Provide examples of each type.
- The provided text classifies companies based on ownership (government/non-government) and public trading status (private/public, listed/unlisted).
- It does not explicitly classify companies based on liability (e.g., limited liability, unlimited liability).
- Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the provided text.

#### 3. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of public companies in raising capital.
- **Advantages of Public Companies in Raising Capital**:
    - A private company can become publicly listed through an Initial Public Offering (IPO).
    - This allows the company to offer its shares to the general public.
    - It provides a way to raise significant capital from a broad base of investors.
    - Listing on a stock exchange can increase visibility and credibility.

- **Disadvantages of Public Companies in Raising Capital**:
    - The text does not explicitly list disadvantages of public companies in raising capital.
    - However, it implies that the process of public offering can be expensive, time-consuming, and procedure-oriented for corporates.

### 2.9 Accounts and Deposits
#### 1. What are the different types of bank accounts available in India?
- Money can be kept in the banking system in two main ways:
    - Demand deposits.
    - Time deposits (or term deposits).
- **Demand Deposit Accounts**:
    - Current Account.
    - Savings Account.
- **Time Deposit Accounts**:
    - Fixed Deposit Account.
    - Recurring Deposit Account.

#### 2. Explain the significance of current and savings accounts for customers and banks.
##### Current Account
- **For Customers**:
    - Always a demand deposit account.
    - No limit on number or value of transactions.
    - Used mainly for business purposes, not saving.
    - Banks provide chequebooks and convenient operational facilities.
- **For Banks**:
    - No interest is paid on these accounts.
    - Banks charge certain service fees.
    - Provides a stable source of funds for banks.

##### Savings Account
- **For Customers**:
    - Mainly for individuals.
    - Also demand deposits, but with restrictions on transactions.
    - Deposits earn interest.
- **For Banks**:
    - Attracts individual savings.
    - Provides funds for lending, though less stable than current accounts.
    - Banks prescribe minimum balances to offset maintenance costs.

#### 3. How do fixed and recurring deposits contribute to a bank's financial stability?
- Fixed and recurring deposits are time deposits.
- Funds can be withdrawn only with advance notice.
- They are held for a specified time period or maturity.
- These are non-cheque-able deposits.
- **Contribution to Financial Stability**:
    - Provide banks with stable, long-term funds.
    - This allows banks to plan their lending activities more effectively.
    - They are less prone to sudden withdrawals compared to demand deposits.
    - This enhances a bank's liquidity management and overall stability.

### 2.10 Money Supply
#### 1. What are the different measures of money supply (M1, M2, M3, M4)? Explain each in detail.
- Money supply is the total stock of money in circulation among the public.
- It includes currency notes, coins, and public deposits in banks.
- RBI publishes figures for four alternative measures of money supply.

##### M1 (Most Liquid)
- M1 = Currency with the Public + Demand deposits of public with banks.
- Represents the most liquid forms of money.

##### M2
- M2 = M1 + Savings Deposits with Post Office Savings Bank.
- Expands M1 by adding less liquid savings deposits.

##### M3 (Broad Money, Most Commonly Used)
- M3 = M1 + Time deposits of public with banks.
- Includes less liquid time deposits.
- Also called "aggregate monetary resources".

##### M4 (Least Liquid)
- M4 = M3 + Total deposits with Post Office Savings Bank.
- The broadest measure, incorporating all deposits.

*Diagram: Money Supply*
*   **M1**: Represents the most liquid forms of money, including currency and demand deposits.
*   **M2**: Expands M1 by adding savings deposits, indicating a broader money supply.
*   **M3**: Includes time deposits, reflecting money that is less liquid but still part of the supply.
*   **M4**: The broadest measure, incorporating all deposits, showing the total money supply.

#### 2. How does the Reserve Bank of India regulate the money supply in the economy?
- RBI is the monetary authority in India.
- It issues currency notes and coins for circulation.
- It controls the creation and supply of money.
- RBI uses monetary policy instruments to regulate money supply.
- These include repo rate, reverse repo rate, CRR, SLR, and OMOs.
- Money supply is increased proportional to expected nominal GDP.

#### 3. Why is M3 considered the broadest measure of money supply in India?
- M3 includes M1 (currency and demand deposits) and time deposits with banks.
- Time deposits are less liquid than demand deposits but are still part of the money stock.
- By including these less liquid components, M3 provides a comprehensive view.
- It is also called "aggregate monetary resources".
- This makes it the most commonly used and broadest measure of money supply.

### 2.11 Money Circulation
#### 1. What factors influence the velocity of money circulation in an economy?
- The provided text does not explicitly discuss "velocity of money circulation" or factors influencing it in this section.
- However, the "Terminology" section defines "Velocity of Money" as the frequency of money turnover.
- It is derived as 'Nominal GDP' / Money Supply.
- Factors influencing it would implicitly relate to changes in nominal GDP or money supply.

#### 2. How do banks and households facilitate the circulation of money?
- **Households**:
    - Provide factor services to enterprises.
    - Receive factor payments (income) from enterprises.
    - Spend this income to purchase goods and services.
    - They also save money by depositing it in banks.
    - They keep some money as cash for transactions.
- **Banks**:
    - Accept deposits from the public.
    - Lend a fraction of these deposits to others (fractional reserve banking).
    - This process creates new money and facilitates its circulation.
    - They manage cash reserves and deposits with RBI.
    - They enable individuals to transact using deposits (e.g., through cheques).
- This continuous flow between households and banks facilitates money circulation.

### 2.12 Money Creation
#### 1. Explain the process of money creation by commercial banks using the credit multiplier.
- Money creation by commercial banks is based on "fractional reserve banking".
- Banks keep only a fraction of deposited money as reserve.
- The rest is lent to others.
- This lending creates new deposits, which are again partially lent.
- This process continues, increasing the total money supply.
- The money multiplier shows how much money supply increases for each unit of monetary base.
- Money Multiplier = (1 + currency-deposit ratio) / (currency-deposit ratio + reserves-deposit ratio).
- Example: If RBI issues Rs. H, money supply can increase to 5H/3 with a multiplier of 5/3.

#### 2. How does the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) affect the money creation process?
- SLR is part of the reserves-deposit ratio (rdr).
- SLR requires banks to maintain reserves in liquid assets (government securities, gold, cash).
- A higher SLR means banks must hold more reserves.
- This reduces the amount of money available for lending.
- A higher SLR thus reduces the money multiplier.
- This limits the money creation capacity of commercial banks.

#### 3. What are the limitations of money creation in a developing economy?
- The provided text does not explicitly discuss limitations of money creation in a developing economy.
- However, it implies that factors like currency-deposit ratio (public behavior) and reserve-deposit ratio (RBI regulations) influence the money multiplier.
- Other implicit limitations could be lack of trust in banks, limited financial literacy, or insufficient demand for loans.

### 2.13 Monetary Policy
#### 1. What are the objectives of monetary policy in India?
- The primary objective is to maintain **price** **stability**.
- This is done while keeping in mind the objective of **growth**.
- It also aims to ensure adequate flow of credit to productive sectors.
- Another objective is achieving financial stability.
- The inflation target is 4% with a band of +/- 2%.

#### 2. Differentiate between quantitative and qualitative tools of monetary policy.
- The provided text lists various instruments/tools of monetary policy (Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, SDF, MSF, Bank Rate, LAF, Reserve Requirements, OMO, MSS).
- These are generally considered quantitative tools.
- The text does not explicitly differentiate between quantitative and qualitative tools.
- Therefore, I cannot provide this differentiation based on the provided text.

#### 3. How does the repo rate influence inflation and economic growth?
- Repo rate is the interest rate at which RBI provides overnight liquidity to banks.
- It is also called the "Policy Rate".
- **Influence on Inflation**:
    - When RBI increases repo rate, banks' borrowing cost rises.
    - This leads to higher lending rates for customers.
    - Higher lending rates discourage borrowing and spending.
    - This reduces aggregate demand, helping to control inflation.
    - Conversely, lowering repo rate can stimulate demand and potentially increase inflation.
- **Influence on Economic Growth**:
    - Lowering repo rate reduces lending rates.
    - This encourages borrowing for consumption and investment.
    - Increased investment and consumption boost aggregate demand.
    - This stimulates economic activity and promotes growth.
    - Higher repo rate can slow down economic growth.

#### 4. Discuss the role of monetary policy in controlling stagflation.
- Stagflation is a situation with high inflation and high unemployment.
- The Phillips Curve suggests an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment.
- However, stagflation disproves this in the short term.
- The text states that the original Phillips curve concept was disproven by stagflation in the 1970s.
- It does not explicitly discuss the role of monetary policy in controlling stagflation.
- Stagflation is often triggered by supply-side factors.

*Diagram: RBI's Monetary Policy Toolkit*

- Interest earned on holding government bonds/securities purchased through OMO.
- Income from lending at Repo rate to banks.
- Commission/income for acting as 'Debt Manager' for Central and State Governments.
- Seigniorage, which is the profit from money creation.

#### 2. Explain the concept of the Economic Capital Framework and its relevance for financial stability.
- Economic Capital Framework (ECF) determines fund allocation to RBI's capital reserves.
- It ensures adequate funds to fight financial system crises.
- It also guides the transfer of remaining net income to the government.
- ECF is relevant for financial stability by ensuring RBI has capital to absorb risks.
- It helps maintain solvency and manage potential financial system shocks.
- The Bimal Jalan Committee recommended maintaining 5.5% to 6.5% of the balance sheet as Contingency Risk Buffer.

- **Definition**: E-Rupee is a legal tender issued by a central bank in digital form.
- It is the same as fiat currency, exchangeable one-to-one with cash.
- Only its form is different (digital).
- **Differences from Cryptocurrency**:
    - CBDC is legal tender, cryptocurrency is not.
    - CBDC is issued by a central bank, cryptocurrency is decentralized.
    - CBDC is backed by the central bank, cryptocurrency value is market-driven.
    - CBDC is regulated, cryptocurrency is largely unregulated.

#### 3. How can the introduction of CBDC benefit India's monetary system?
- CBDC will complement cash, not replace it.
- It will be issued in existing currency denominations.
- It will be distributed through banks.
- Payments would be faster and easier without settlement delays.
- It offers an efficient, trusted, and regulated payment option.
- It can lead to higher seigniorage due to lower printing/distribution costs.
- It offers features of physical cash like trust, safety, and settlement.
- It can strengthen the operating framework of monetary policy.

    - An external benchmark, not controlled by individual banks.
    - Aims for faster and more transparent transmission of policy rates.

| Feature | Base Rate | MCLR | External Benchmark Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calculation Basis** | Average cost of funds | Marginal cost of funds | External market rates (e.g., repo rate) |
| **Nature** | Internal benchmark | Internal benchmark | External benchmark |
| **Transparency** | Less transparent | Improved transparency | Most transparent |
| **Policy Transmission** | Slow | Faster than Base Rate | Fastest |
| **Mandatory For** | All loans (before MCLR) | All loans (before EBLR) | New floating rate retail/MSME loans |

#### 2. How do these rates influence loan pricing in the banking sector?
- These rates serve as the minimum lending rates for banks.
- Banks add a "spread" (credit risk premium, operational costs) to these benchmark rates.
- The final loan price (interest rate) for customers is the benchmark rate plus the spread.
- Changes in these benchmark rates directly influence the interest rates on loans.
- External benchmark rates ensure quicker and more transparent transmission of RBI's policy rate changes to loan pricing.

### 2.20 BASEL Norms
#### 1. What are the key provisions of BASEL III norms?
- Basel III guidelines were released in 2010 in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
- They aim to promote a more resilient banking system.
- Key provisions focus on four vital banking parameters:
    - **Capital**: Improve quantity and quality of capital.
    - **Leverage/Debt**: Reduce excessive debt.
    - **Funding**: Improve funding stability.
    - **Liquidity**: Enhance banks' ability to absorb shocks.
- Minimum capital requirement is 10.5% of risk-weighted assets (including 2.5% capital conservation buffer).
- India's requirement is 11.5%.

#### 2. How do BASEL norms enhance banking stability?
- Basel norms aim to tackle the risk of bank failures.
- They ensure financial institutions have enough capital to meet obligations.
- They help absorb unexpected losses.
- Basel I focused on credit risk, setting minimum capital.
- Basel II added supervisory review and market discipline.
- Basel III further strengthened capital, leverage, funding, and liquidity.
- Higher Capital to Risk Weighted Asset Ratio (CRAR) means safer bank deposits.
- This reduces the likelihood of bank runs and systemic crises.

#### 3. Discuss the challenges faced by Indian banks in implementing BASEL III norms.
- The text states that Scheduled Commercial Banks have achieved the minimum Basel III capital requirement.
- It does not explicitly detail challenges faced by Indian banks in implementing Basel III norms.
- However, it mentions that when loans go bad, banks have to make provisions, which erodes capital and puts brakes on loan growth.
- This implies that managing NPAs and maintaining capital adequacy can be a continuous challenge.

### 2.21 Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)
#### 1. What is the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework? How does it ensure banking discipline?
- PCA framework is a supervisory tool used by RBI.
- It specifies regulatory trigger points for banks.
- These triggers are based on three parameters:
    - **Capital** (Capital Adequacy Ratio).
    - **Asset Quality** (NPA).
    - **Leverage** (equity capital/total assets).
- Once a bank hits a threshold, RBI initiates structured and discretionary actions.
- It ensures banking discipline by forcing banks to take corrective measures.
- It encourages banks to avoid riskier activities and conserve capital.
- This strengthens their balance sheets.

#### 2. Under what circumstances does the RBI invoke PCA for a bank?
- RBI invokes PCA when a bank hits certain threshold levels.
- These thresholds are defined for:
    - Capital Adequacy Ratio.
    - Non-Performing Assets (NPA) level.
    - Leverage ratio.
- It can also be invoked for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in case of serious governance issues.
- The objective is to restore the bank's financial health in a timely manner.

### 2.22 Systemically Important Financial Institutions
#### 1. What are Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs)?
- SIFIs are financial institutions (banks and NBFCs) that are very important.
- Their importance comes from their size, complexity, and interconnectedness.
- Their failure could cause significant disruption to essential financial services.
- This would impact overall economic activity.
- They are also called "Too Big to Fail".

#### 2. How are SIFIs identified, and why are they critical for global financial stability?
- **Identification**:
    - RBI declares banks with asset size > 2% of GDP as Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs).
    - RBI also declares Domestic Systemically Important NBFCs if their asset size > Rs. 500 crores.
    - IRDAI declares Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SII) based on assets and premium.
    - SEBI declares Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI).
- **Criticality for Stability**:
    - Their failure can cause significant disruption to financial services.
    - This can lead to overall economic instability.
    - They are subject to additional regulatory/supervisory measures (e.g., capital requirements).
    - This is to mitigate the risks they pose to the financial system.

### 2.23 Foreign Investment
#### 1. Differentiate between Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI).
- **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**:
    - Investment through 'capital instruments' by a non-resident.
    - In an unlisted Indian company.
    - Or, 10% or more of equity capital of a listed Indian company.
    - Generally happens through primary market, bringing new capital.
    - Foreign investor gets involved in active management (appoints Board of Directors).
    - Long-term and stable investment.
- **Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)**:
    - Investment through 'capital instruments' by a non-resident.
    - Less than 10% of equity capital of a listed Indian company.
    - Can also invest in government securities and corporate bonds (debt).
    - Generally happens through secondary market, changing ownership hands.
    - Foreign investors usually do not get involved in management.
    - Generally short-term and can lead to exchange rate volatility.

| Feature | Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) | Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ownership Stake** | ≥ 10% in listed, or any in unlisted company | < 10% in listed company |
| **Market Entry** | Generally primary market | Generally secondary market |
| **Capital Flow** | New capital to the company | Ownership change, new capital may not flow to company |
| **Management Involvement** | Active management, decision-making | Generally no involvement |
| **Investment Horizon** | Long-term | Short-term |
| **Stability** | More stable | Less stable, can cause volatility |

#### 2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of FDI for developing countries?
##### Advantages of FDI
- Brings in new capital for investment.
- Can introduce better management skills and technology.
- Promotes economic growth and job creation.
- Helps in integrating with global value chains.
- Can enhance domestic competitiveness.
- Contributes to overall economic development.

##### Disadvantages of FDI
- The text does not explicitly list disadvantages of FDI for developing countries.
- However, it mentions that issuing debt in foreign currencies could expose the country to exchange rate risk.
- It also implies that FPIs can lead to volatility in the rupee.

### 2.24 Currency Swap and Forex Swap
#### 1. What is the role of currency swaps in managing foreign exchange reserves?
- Currency swap agreements are between central banks of two countries.
- One country exchanges its national currency for another's.
- Example: India gets Yen/dollars from Japan, Japan gets Indian Rupees.
- The exchange is reversed later at the same initial exchange rate.
- This provides a country with a credit line in foreign currency.
- It acts as an additional buffer for foreign exchange reserves.
- It helps maintain stability in foreign exchange and capital markets.
- It carries no exchange rate or other market risks as terms are set in advance.

#### 2. How do forex swaps facilitate international trade?
- The provided text describes forex swaps as an RBI operation to manage liquidity.
- Under forex swap, RBI buys dollars from banks and gives rupees.
- Later, RBI gives dollars back and asks for rupees from banks.
- The text does not explicitly explain how forex swaps facilitate international trade.
- It focuses on its role in increasing rupee liquidity in the economy.

### 2.25 GIFT City (Gujarat International Financial Tech City)
#### 1. What is the vision behind GIFT City? How does it aim to strengthen India's financial sector?
- GIFT City has two zones: "Domestic" and "SEZ".
- GIFT SEZ is India’s first International Financial Services Centre (IFSC).
- **Vision**: To bring financial services transactions to India.
- These transactions are currently done outside India by overseas institutions.

- Offers tax incentives like no STT, no LTCG, and low MAT.

### 2.26 Strategic Disinvestment
#### 1. Define strategic disinvestment and explain its importance for fiscal management.
- **Definition**: Strategic disinvestment means selling a substantial portion of government shareholding.
- It involves transferring up to 50% or higher percentage to a strategic partner.
- It also includes transferring management control to the strategic partner.
- It is a way of privatization.
- **Importance for Fiscal Management**:
    - Provides additional income to the government.
    - Helps in meeting fiscal deficit targets.
    - Allows government to spend more on infrastructure and social sectors.
    - Reduces the government's role in businesses where it has no core competence.

#### 2. How does strategic disinvestment differ from privatization?
- **Strategic Disinvestment**:
    - Specific type of disinvestment.
    - Involves selling a substantial stake (up to 50% or more).
    - Includes transfer of management control to a strategic partner.
    - It is a *way* of privatization.
- **Privatization**:
    - Broader term.
    - Means transfer of business, industry, or service from public to private ownership.
    - Can involve full sale of government stake.
    - Strategic disinvestment is a form of privatization.

| Feature | Strategic Disinvestment | Privatization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | Specific type of disinvestment, involves management transfer | Broader term, transfer of ownership/control from public to private |
| **Government Stake** | Substantial portion (≥50%) transferred with management control | Can be full sale of government stake |
| **Relationship** | A method or form of privatization | The overarching process of shifting to private sector |

### 2.27 Balance of Payments (BoP)
#### 1. What are the components of the Balance of Payments (BoP)?
- BoP systematically summarizes economic transactions of a country.
- It records transactions between residents and the rest of the world.
- BoP has two main components:
    - Current Account.
    - Capital Account.

##### Current Account
- Deals with transactions that do not alter assets or liabilities.
- Comprises:
    - **Visible trade**: Export and import of goods (Merchandise).
    - **Invisible trade**: Export and import of services (Banking, Telecom, etc.).
    - **Unilateral transfers**: Gifts, Grants, Remittances.
    - **Investment income**: Income from factors of production (Profit, Interest, dividend on assets abroad).

##### Capital Account
- Records inflows and outflows of capital.
- Directly affects a country’s foreign assets and liabilities.
- Comprises:
    - **Foreign Investment**: FDI, FPI.
    - **Loan**: External Commercial Borrowing (ECB).
    - **Banking Capital**: NRI deposits.

*Diagram: BoP*
*   **BoP**
    *   **Current Account**
        *   **Merchandise** (Exports & Imports of goods)
        *   **Invisibles**
            *   **Services** (Banking, Telecom, etc)
            *   **Factor Income**
                1. Employee Compensation
                2. Investment Income (Profit, Interest, dividend on the assets abroad)
            *   **Transfers**
                1. Gifts
                2. Grants
                3. Remittances
    *   **Capital Account**
        *   **Foreign Investment** (FDI, FPI)
        *   **Loan** (ECB)
        *   **Banking Capital** (NRI deposits)

#### 2. How does the BoP reflect the economic performance of a country?
- BoP shows all economic transactions with the rest of the world.
- A current account deficit means a country imports more goods/services than it exports.
- A capital account surplus indicates more foreign investment/loans coming in.
- The overall balance of payments (current + capital account) reflects net foreign exchange earned.
- A surplus leads to an increase in foreign exchange reserves.
- A deficit leads to a decrease in foreign exchange reserves.
- It indicates a country's financial health and its ability to meet external obligations.

### 2.28 Liquidity Trap
#### 1. What is a liquidity trap? How does it affect the effectiveness of monetary policy?
- A liquidity trap occurs when nominal interest rates (deposit rates) are near zero.
- Central banks cannot reduce repo rates below zero.
- Banks' deposit and lending rates also reach near zero.
- **Effect on Monetary Policy**:
    - Monetary policy becomes ineffective in stimulating the economy.
    - People prefer to hold cash or demand deposits.
    - They expect future interest rates to rise, so they postpone investment.
    - This keeps demand low, and the economy remains weak.
    - The central bank is "trapped" and cannot further stimulate lending/spending.

#### 2. Discuss measures to overcome a liquidity trap.
- In a liquidity trap, monetary policy is ineffective.
- The government should use its fiscal tools.
- This means increasing government spending or reducing taxes.
- Fiscal policy can directly boost aggregate demand.
- This helps pull the economy out of recession or slowdown.

### 2.29 Inflation
#### 1. What are the different types of inflation? Explain with examples.
- Inflation is the rate at which general prices rise and purchasing power falls.

##### Low Inflation (Creeping Inflation)
- Prices rise slowly and predictably, in single digits annually.
- Regarded as safe and essential for economic growth.
- People are willing to save and sign long-term contracts.

##### Galloping Inflation (Very High Inflation)
- Inflation in double or triple digit range (20%, 100%, 200% per year).
- Found in countries with weak governments, war, or revolution.
- People hoard goods and avoid lending money at low nominal rates.
- Businesses are unwilling to invest due to high lending rates and declining demand.

##### Hyper Inflation
- Prices rise over a million percent per year.
- Relative prices become highly unstable.
- Example: Germany in the early 1920s, USSR in 1991.

##### Demand Pull Inflation
- Occurs when aggregate demand increases.
- Four sectors (households, private, government, foreign) want to buy more than economy can produce.
- "Too much money chasing too few goods."
- Usually in an expanding economy.
- Caused by over-expansion of money supply, tax cuts, increased government spending.

##### Cost Push or Supply Shock Inflation
- Prices are "pushed up" by increased costs of factors of production.
- Or due to supply shortages.
- Caused by wage inflation, monopolies, natural disasters, currency devaluation.

#### 2. How does inflation impact savings, investment, and consumption?
- **Savings**:
    - In galloping inflation, people are unwilling to save in banks.
    - This is because nominal interest rates are lower than inflation.
    - Purchasing power of money erodes, compromising its "store of value" function.
- **Investment**:
    - In galloping inflation, businesses are unwilling to invest.
    - Lending rates are high, and demand declines.
    - High inflation creates uncertainty, deterring long-term investment.
- **Consumption**:
    - High inflation reduces purchasing power, impacting consumption.
    - People may hoard goods to avoid future price increases.
    - Deflation (general decline in prices) makes people postpone purchases.
    - This reduces demand and slows down the economy.

#### 3. What tools are available to control inflation in an economy?
- **Monetary Policy Tools (by Central Bank)**:
    - Increase repo rate to reduce money supply and demand.
    - Increase Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR).
    - Sell government securities through Open Market Operations (OMO) to absorb liquidity.
- **Fiscal Policy Tools (by Government)**:
    - Reduce government spending.
    - Increase tax levels to reduce aggregate demand.
- **Supply-side Measures**:
    - Address supply shortages (e.g., through imports).
    - Improve infrastructure to reduce production costs.

### 2.30 Phillips Curve
#### 1. What is the Phillips Curve, and how does it explain the relationship between inflation and unemployment?
- The Phillips Curve is an economic concept by A. W. Phillips.
- It states that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship.
- Higher inflation rate means lower unemployment rate, and vice-versa.
- It suggests that economic growth leads to more jobs and higher inflation.
- This implies a trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

#### 2. Is the Phillips Curve relevant in the modern economic scenario? Discuss.
- The original concept has been somewhat disproven empirically.
- This is due to the occurrence of **stagflation** in the 1970s.
- Stagflation showed high levels of both inflation and unemployment simultaneously.
- This indicates that the Phillips Curve's implications are true only in the short term.
- In the long term, other factors can influence both inflation and unemployment.

## 3. Money and Banking - Part 2
### 3.1 History of Indian Banking and Reforms
#### 1. Briefly trace the history of banking in India, from the establishment of the first bank to the nationalization of banks in 1969.
- Modern banking began in the 18th Century with English Agency Houses.
- Three presidency banks (Bengal, Bombay, Madras) were established in early 19th Century.
- Private and foreign banks entered after limited liability in 1860.

- After independence, Imperial Bank was transformed into SBI in 1955.
- In July 1969, government nationalized 14 major commercial banks.

#### 2. Discuss the impact of the Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG) reforms on the Indian banking system in the 1990s.
- Before 1991, banks were unprofitable, inefficient, and unsound.
- This was due to stringent CRR/SLR, low interest rates on government bonds, and directed lending.

- Government control over capital issues and pricing was abolished.
- These reforms aimed to improve efficiency and competition.

#### 3. What was the role of the Narasimham Committee (1991) in shaping banking reforms in India?
- The Narasimham Committee (Committee on Financial System) was formed in 1991.
- It reviewed the Indian financial sector and suggested reforms.
- **Key Recommendations**:
    - SLR should be based on prudential requirements, not government finance.
    - Interest rates should be gradually deregulated.
    - RBI should use open market operations more than CRR.
    - Interest rates on SLR investments should be market-related.
    - Directed credit programs should be phased out or redefined.
    - Create a level playing field for public, private, and foreign banks.
    - Establish an Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) for bad debts.
    - Select few large banks for international character.
    - End duality of control over banking system; RBI should be primary regulator.

#### 4. How has the banking structure in India evolved since independence? Include both public and private sector banks in your answer.
- **Post-Independence (1947-1969)**:
    - Banking system was fairly developed with over 600 commercial banks.
    - Imperial Bank transformed into SBI in 1955 to cover banking needs.
    - Banks were perceived as biased towards trade and large firms.
- **Nationalization Era (1969-1991)**:
    - 14 major private banks nationalized in 1969, 6 more in 1980.
    - Public sector banks' share of deposits increased to 92%.
    - Rapid branch expansion, especially in rural areas.
    - Channelling of credit to priority sectors.
    - Increased CRR and SLR requirements.
    - Banks became unprofitable, inefficient, and unsound due to controls.
- **Post-1991 Reforms (LPG)**:
    - Banking sector opened to private competition (new private banks).
    - Focus shifted to efficiency, competition, and financial stability.
    - Narasimham Committees recommended deregulation and prudential norms.
    - Dual regulation of PSBs by government and RBI continued.
    - Establishment of regulatory bodies like SEBI.
    - Introduction of new types of banks (Payment Banks, Small Finance Banks).

#### 5. Explain the significance of the introduction of the Nationalization of Banks Act, 1969, and its long-term impact on Indian banking.
- **Significance**:
    - Objective: "Control the commanding heights of the economy."
    - Aimed to meet development needs in line with national policy.
    - Served to intensify social objective of meeting credit demands for productive purposes.
    - Led to rapid branch expansion, especially in rural and urban areas.
    - Channeled credit according to plan priorities.
- **Long-term Impact**:
    - Rapid growth in deposits mobilized by banks.
    - Credit expansion, particularly in priority sectors.
    - Breadth and scope of Indian banking expanded significantly.
    - However, banks became unprofitable, inefficient, and unsound.
    - This was due to stringent regulations, low interest rates on government bonds, and directed lending.
    - Fostered rigidities and inefficiencies in the commercial banking system.

#### 6. What is the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in regulating banking reforms? Provide examples of RBI's reforms in the post-1991 era.
- RBI plays a crucial role in regulating banking reforms.
- It is the primary agency for banking system regulation.
- **Examples of Post-1991 Reforms**:
    - **Deregulation of Interest Rates**: Gradually deregulated interest rates.
    - **Prudential Norms**: Prescribed norms like asset classification, income recognition, provisioning, capital adequacy (Basel norms).
    - **New Bank Licenses**: Granted licenses to new private banks.
    - **Regulatory Framework**: Established SEBI (statutory powers in 1992) for capital markets.
    - **Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999**: Replaced FERA 1973.
    - **Monetary Policy Framework Agreement (2015)**: Focused on price stability.

    - **New Lending Rate Methodologies**: Introduced MCLR (2016) and External Benchmark Rate (2019).
    - **PCA Framework**: Introduced for banking discipline.
    - **New Bank Categories**: Licensed Payment Banks and Small Finance Banks.

### 3.2 Relationship between RBI and Government of India
#### 1. Explain the role of the RBI in the Indian economy and its relationship with the Government of India.
- RBI is the central bank and monetary authority of India.
- **Role in Economy**:
    - Monetary Management (price stability, growth).
    - Regulation and supervision of financial institutions.
    - Management of foreign exchange reserves.
    - Banker and debt manager to government.
    - Issuer of currency.
    - Oversight of payment systems.
    - Developmental role (credit to productive sectors).
- **Relationship with GoI**:
    - They work in close coordination.
    - RBI Governor draws powers from RBI Act, not the Central Board.
    - Central Board functions in an advisory role.
    - In case of fundamental disagreement, Centre can use Section 7 of RBI Act.
    - Section 7 allows GoI to give written directions to RBI.
    - This power is rarely used, indicating mutual respect and responsibility.
    - There is a natural separation between government (spender) and RBI (money creator).

#### 2. How does the RBI assist the government in fiscal policy implementation, particularly in public debt management?
- RBI acts as the debt manager for Central and State Governments.
- It manages public debt and issues new loans on their behalf.
- RBI's debt management policy aims to minimize borrowing cost.
- It also aims to reduce risk and smoothen debt maturity structure.
- RBI provides "Ways and Means Advances" (WMA) to meet temporary cash mismatches.
- It arranges investments of surplus cash balances for governments.

#### 3. What is the role of the RBI in managing the government's foreign exchange reserves?
- RBI is the custodian of the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
- It is vested with the responsibility of managing their investment.
- Legal provisions are laid down in the RBI Act 1934.
- RBI invests reserves in deposits with international banks and debt instruments.
- Its policies prioritize safety, liquidity, and returns.
- It assesses reserves adequacy based on import cover and external shocks.
- The objective is to align reserves with economic growth potential and capital flows.

#### 4. How does the RBI contribute to the government's budgetary process and monetary policy formulation?
- **Budgetary Process**:
    - RBI acts as banker to the government, managing receipts and payments.
    - It maintains government accounts (Consolidated Fund, Contingency Fund, Public Account).
    - It provides Ways and Means Advances for temporary mismatches.
    - It advises the government on monetary and banking matters.
- **Monetary Policy Formulation**:
    - RBI is the monetary authority, formulating and executing monetary policy.
    - It operates within the "Monetary Policy Framework" agreement with GoI.
    - The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), with GoI-appointed members, determines the policy rate.
    - RBI's decisions aim to maintain price stability while considering growth.

#### 5. Discuss the process of coordination between the RBI and the Ministry of Finance during times of economic crises, such as during the 2008 global financial crisis.
- The text mentions that the RBI and government work in close coordination.
- It highlights that Section 7 of the RBI Act (GoI's power to direct RBI) has never been used.
- This is a "testimony to the sense of responsibility that the government and the central bank have displayed."
- It implies that disagreements are sorted out quietly behind the scenes.
- The text emphasizes continuous and sustained dialogue and an atmosphere of give and take.
- It does not specifically detail the coordination process during the 2008 global financial crisis.

#### 6. How do the roles of the RBI Governor and the Finance Minister differ in shaping economic policy?
- **RBI Governor**:
    - Draws powers from the RBI Act, not the Central Board.
    - Appointed by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Finance Minister.
    - Takes policy decisions with Deputy Governors.
    - Focuses on monetary policy, price stability, and financial stability.
- **Finance Minister**:
    - Represents the elected government.
    - Ultimately answerable to the citizens for economic performance.
    - Can use Section 7 of the RBI Act to direct RBI in public interest.
    - Responsible for fiscal policy (government spending and taxation).
- The RBI is kept at arm’s length from the Centre due to its role as money creator.
- The Finance Minister's view may prevail in fundamental disagreements.

### 3.3 Should Large Corporates be Allowed to Open Their Own Banks?
#### 1. What are the arguments in favor of allowing large corporates to own and operate banks? Provide examples from other countries.
- The text states that India's bank balance sheet is less than 70% of GDP.
- Domestic bank credit to the private sector is only 50% of GDP.
- Government-owned banks struggle with NPAs.
- Government finances are strained, limiting growth push via public banks.
- Large corporates have deep pockets to fund India’s future growth.
- The text does not provide examples from other countries.

#### 2. Discuss the potential risks of corporate ownership of banks, particularly in terms of conflicts of interest and financial stability.
- **Conflicts of Interest (Inter-connected Lending)**:
    - Promoter/owner of the bank is also a borrower.
    - Possible to channel depositors’ money into their own group companies.
    - Funds can be directed to cronies at relaxed terms.
    - Banks can provide finance to customers and suppliers of their businesses.
    - Increases concentration of economic power.
- **Financial Stability Risks**:
    - RBI can only react to interconnected lending *ex-post*.
    - Tracing funds through maze of entities is challenging.
    - Any RBI action could cause flight of deposits and precipitate bank failure.
    - Banks owned by corporates are exposed to risks of non-bank entities in the group.
    - If non-bank entities face trouble, bank sentiment is impacted.
    - Depositors would need protection via public safety net.
    - It is prudent to keep borrowers (big corporates) separate from lenders (banks).

#### 3. How can corporate ownership in banking influence credit distribution and financial inclusion in India?
- **Credit Distribution**:
    - Corporate houses can channel depositors' money to their own group companies.
    - They can direct funds to cronies at more relaxed terms.
    - This could lead to misallocation of credit, away from other deserving borrowers.
    - It can increase concentration of economic power.
- **Financial Inclusion**:
    - The text does not directly discuss the influence on financial inclusion.
    - However, if credit is diverted to group companies, it might reduce credit availability for broader segments.
    - This could potentially hinder financial inclusion efforts if not properly regulated.

#### 4. What is the RBI's stance on corporate ownership in banking? How has this evolved over time?
- The text implies RBI's cautious stance due to potential risks.
- It suggests that allowing large corporates should only happen after strengthening supervisory mechanisms.
- The text does not explicitly detail how RBI's stance has evolved over time.
- However, the discussion of risks suggests a preference for separation between borrowers and lenders.

### 3.6 Categorization of Loans
#### 1. What are the different categories of loans in the Indian banking system? Define each category.
- Loans and advances given by banks are classified based on their performance.
- **Standard Assets**: Loans where interest and principal payments are regular.
- **Non-Performing Assets (NPA)**: Loans where interest and/or principal are overdue for more than 90 days.
- **Restructured Asset**: A bad loan modified into a new loan with extended repayment or reduced interest.
- **Written-off Asset**: A loan that the lender no longer counts as an asset on its balance sheet.
- **Stressed Assets**: A broader category including NPAs, Restructured loans, and Written-off assets.

#### 2. Explain the concept of "priority sector lending" and its importance for the inclusive growth of India.
- **Concept**: Priority sectors are those that may not get timely and adequate credit otherwise.
- Banks are mandated to lend a certain percentage of their total credit to these sectors.
- It includes small value loans to sectors impacting large populations and weaker sections.
- Examples: Agriculture, MSME, Education, Housing, Renewable energy, Social Infrastructure.
- **Importance for Inclusive Growth**:
    - Ensures credit flow to needy segments and employment-intensive sectors.

- This is aimed at bringing transparency and consistency in bank accounts.
- RBI defines what constitutes a Non-Performing Asset (NPA).
- It also issues guidelines for restructuring of loans.
- RBI's guidelines ensure banks maintain sound financial health.

#### 4. How does the categorization of loans affect credit risk and the overall banking environment?
- Categorization helps assess credit risk.
- NPAs indicate higher credit risk for banks.
- Restructured loans also indicate bad asset quality.
- High levels of NPAs and stressed assets impact bank balance sheets.
- This can reduce banks' ability to lend further.
- It affects the overall financial health and stability of the banking environment.
- Proper categorization ensures transparency for investors and regulators.

#### 5. What are Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), and how do they impact the categorization of loans?
- **Definition**: NPAs are assets (loans) for which interest and/or principal payments have remained overdue for more than 90 days.
- **Impact on Categorization**:
    - NPAs are a key category of stressed assets.
    - Loans are classified as standard or non-performing based on payment status.
    - Once a loan becomes an NPA, it requires higher provisioning by banks.
    - This affects the bank's capital adequacy ratio.
    - Restructured loans, though modified, are also indicative of past NPAs.

#### 6. How do banks ensure that loans are categorized properly to comply with RBI norms?
- Banks follow RBI's prescribed norms for asset classification.
- They monitor loan performance regularly.
- If interest/principal is overdue for over 90 days, loans are classified as NPA.

- The Act was enacted to overcome these delays.

#### 5. How does the SARFAESI Act compare to other global mechanisms for loan recovery and debt resolution?
- The text does not explicitly compare SARFAESI Act to other global mechanisms.
- It highlights that before SARFAESI, Indian banks lacked power to take possession of securities without court intervention.
- This implies that the Act brought India's loan recovery mechanisms closer to international practices.

#### 6. Discuss the role of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) under the SARFAESI Act.
- ARCs are companies registered with RBI.
- Their purpose is to carry on the business of asset reconstruction or securitization.
- Under the Act, ARCs can acquire rights or interests in any debt/loan/advance from banks.
- This is for the purpose of realization/recovery of such debt.

- ARCs help banks clean up their balance sheets by taking over bad loans.

### 3.8 NPA Crisis and Bad Bank
#### 1. What are Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), and why are they a critical issue for the Indian banking sector?
- NPAs are loans where interest and/or principal payments are overdue for over 90 days.
- **Critical Issue because**:
    - They impact bank balance sheets by reducing profitability.
    - They erode bank capital, limiting further lending.
    - They can lead to financial instability in the banking sector.
    - They tie up funds that could otherwise be used for productive investment.
    - High NPAs can hinder economic growth.

#### 2. How does an NPA affect the balance sheet of a bank and the wider economy?
- **Bank Balance Sheet**:
    - NPAs are non-earning assets, reducing bank profitability.
    - Banks must make provisions for potential losses, eroding capital.
    - This reduces the bank's Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).
    - It limits the bank's ability to give new loans.
- **Wider Economy**:
    - Reduced lending by banks slows down investment.
    - This can hamper economic growth.
    - It can lead to a credit crunch.
    - It can cause financial instability if many banks are affected.

#### 3. What are the reasons behind the rise of NPAs in India's banking sector in the last two decades?
- Credit-led boom of the 2000s.
- Global Financial Crisis of 2008.

- Covid-19 crisis, which is expected to aggravate the problem.

#### 4. What is a "bad bank," and how could it help resolve the NPA crisis in India?
- A "bad bank" is technically an Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) or Asset Management Company.
- In India, it is named ‘National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd.’ (NARCL).
- It takes over bad loans from commercial banks.
- It manages these bad loans and tries to recover money over time.
- **Help in NPA Resolution**:
    - Helps commercial banks clean up their balance sheets.
    - Frees up commercial bank's capital for further lending.
    - Promotes investment and growth in the economy.
    - Centralizes NPA resolution with experts.
    - Government guarantee on securities issued by bad bank provides comfort.

#### 5. Discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of creating a bad bank in the Indian context.
##### Advantages
- Frees up commercial bank’s capital for further lending.
- Promotes investment and growth in the economy.
- Centralizes NPA resolution with experts.
- Cleans up bank balance sheets.
- Government guarantee provides comfort to commercial banks selling NPAs.

##### Disadvantages
- Mere transfer of NPAs does not reduce overall NPA in the economy.
- The bad bank itself has to manage and recover these bad loans.
- Potential for moral hazard if banks become less cautious in lending.
- Financial burden on the government if guarantees are invoked.
- The text does not explicitly list disadvantages.

#### 6. What role can the RBI play in addressing the NPA crisis? Provide examples of RBI's regulatory measures that have been effective.
- RBI plays a crucial role through its supervisory framework.
- **Regulatory Measures**:
    - **Strict Supervision**: Post-2013, RBI's strict supervision surfaced NPAs.
    - **PCA Framework**: Imposes restrictions on banks based on capital, asset quality, and leverage.
    - **RBI Circular (June 2019)**: Mandated resolution strategy within 30 days of default.
    - **Inter-Creditor Agreement (ICA)**: Required for resolution plans.
    - **Additional Provisioning**: Imposed penalties for delayed resolution plans.
    - **Amendments to Banking Regulation Act (2017)**: Authorized RBI to direct insolvency process.

    - Additional provisioning (20%, then 15%) for delays in RP implementation.
- **Bankruptcy Resolution**:
    - Additional provisions reversed if resolution pursued under IBC Code.
    - Half reversed on filing insolvency application, rest on admission.
    - This incentivized moving cases to IBC.

#### 4. Discuss the challenges faced by Indian banks in implementing the new NPA resolution framework.
- The text does not explicitly detail challenges faced by Indian banks in implementing the June 2019 circular.
- However, it implies that the strict timelines and provisioning requirements could be challenging if resolution is complex or delayed.
- The Supreme Court judgment of April 2019 also limited RBI's power to direct general insolvency processes.

#### 5. How does the June 2019 RBI circular align with global best practices in NPA resolution?
- The text does not explicitly state how the circular aligns with global best practices.
- However, the context of the circular (addressing NPA mess, encouraging IBC) suggests an alignment with efforts to improve debt resolution mechanisms.
- The emphasis on time-bound resolution and disincentives for delay is a common feature in effective resolution frameworks globally.

- A creditor or corporate debtor can initiate the process if default > Rs. 1 crore.
- Application is made to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
- Corporate insolvency process must be completed within 180 days.
- This period can be extended by 90 days in complex cases.
- Overall, it should be completed within 330 days, with exceptions for legal proceedings.
- If no resolution plan is approved by CoC, assets are liquidated.

#### 3. Explain the role of the Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) under the IBC framework.
- NCLT appoints Insolvency Professionals (IPs) upon confirmation by IBBI.
- IPs play a key role in the efficient working of the bankruptcy process.
- They make public announcements of insolvency initiation.
- They call for submission of claims by other creditors.
- They constitute the Committee of Creditors (CoC).
- They submit the insolvency resolution plan to the CoC for approval.

- **Addressing Challenges**:
    - Increase NCLT benches and capacity.
    - Streamline legal proceedings to adhere to timelines.
    - Implement cross-border insolvency framework.
    - Focus on maximizing asset value through resolution rather than liquidation.

#### 6. How does the IBC interact with the SARFAESI Act and other laws in the context of loan recovery?
- Before IBC, multiple overlapping laws existed (Company Law Boards, DRT, SARFAESI, SICA).
- IBC consolidated and amended these laws.
- The text states that IBC makes it easier to wind up a failing business and recover debts.
- It does not explicitly detail the interaction between IBC and SARFAESI Act.
- However, the 2017 amendments to the Banking Regulation Act authorized RBI to direct insolvency process under IBC.
- This implies IBC is now the primary framework for comprehensive resolution.

*The IBC process flowchart*
Default on Repayment -> Insolvency Resolution initiated by Creditor or Debtor -> Acceptance of insolvency application by NCLT -> NCLT appoints Insolvency Professionals -> Constitution of Committee of Creditors (CoC) -> Resolution Plan submitted by Resolution Professionals to CoC ->
*   **Resolution** (If approved by 66% vote by value of CoC)
*   **Liquidation** (If Resolution Plan is not approved by CoC)

### 3.11 Advance Pricing Agreement (APA)
#### 1. What is an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA)? Explain its significance in international taxation.
- An APA is a contract between a taxpayer and at least one tax authority.

    - Enhances tax revenues.
    - Makes the country an attractive destination for foreign investments.
    - Agreements are binding on both taxpayer and government.

#### 2. How does an APA help multinational corporations and tax authorities resolve transfer pricing disputes?
- MNCs may shift profits to low-tax countries (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting - BEPS).
- This is done by charging convenient prices for intra-group transactions.
- APAs pre-set the price charged for different components between related parties.
- This price must follow the "arm's length principle" (market-based).
- By agreeing on the pricing method in advance, disputes are avoided.
- It provides certainty for both the corporation and the tax authority.

#### 3. Discuss the process of negotiating and implementing an APA in India.
- The text states that the price for intra-company transactions is determined in advance.
- This arrangement is between the multinational corporation and India's tax department.
- It is kept for the coming five years or so.
- The text does not provide further details on the specific steps of negotiation and implementation.

- It makes the tax environment more predictable for businesses.

## Government Budgeting
### 4.1 Introduction
#### 1. What is a government budget, and why is it essential for economic governance?
- A government budget is an estimate of income and expenditure.
- It is for a future period, generally a financial year.
- **Essential for Economic Governance because**:
    - Article 265: No tax can be levied without authority of law.
    - Article 266: No expenditure can be incurred without legislative authorization.
    - Government seeks Parliament's approval for taxes (Finance Bill) and expenditures (Appropriation Bill).
    - It outlines the government's financial plan and priorities.

#### 2. Explain the key objectives of government budgeting.
- The text does not explicitly list "key objectives of government budgeting" in this section.
- However, it implies objectives related to:
    - Securing parliamentary approval for taxes and expenditures.
    - Providing an estimate of receipts and expenditures for a financial year.
    - Ensuring financial discipline and accountability.

#### 3. Differentiate between revenue receipts and capital receipts in the context of government budgets.
- **Revenue Receipts**:
    - Neither create a liability for the government.
    - Nor reduce the assets (physical or financial) of the government.
    - Non-redeemable (cannot be reclaimed).
    - Examples: Tax revenues (direct/indirect), non-tax revenues (interest, dividends, fees).
- **Capital Receipts**:
    - Either create liability for the government.
    - Or reduce the assets (physical or financial) of the government.
    - Examples: Loans raised (market borrowings, from RBI), foreign loans, recovery of loans, disinvestment proceeds.

| Feature | Revenue Receipts | Capital Receipts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Impact on Liability** | Neither create liability | Either create liability |
| **Impact on Assets** | Nor reduce assets | Or reduce assets |
| **Nature** | Non-redeemable | Redeemable (e.g., loans to be repaid) |
| **Examples** | Taxes, interest, dividends, fees | Borrowings, loan recoveries, disinvestment |

#### 4. How does government budgeting impact fiscal policy and economic growth?
- Government budgeting is the means by which government adjusts spending and tax rates.
- This directly influences fiscal policy.
- **Impact on Economic Growth**:
    - Government spending on infrastructure can boost aggregate demand (short-run).
    - It can also increase productive capacity (long-run).
    - Tax reductions can increase disposable income, stimulating consumption/investment.
    - Budgeting decisions allocate resources to various sectors, influencing their growth.
    - It can be used to stabilize business cycles (expansionary/contractionary policy).

*Diagram: Budget Classification*
*   **Zero-based Budget**: A budgeting approach starting from scratch to ensure relevance and efficiency.
*   **Outcome Budget**: A strategy to convert financial outlays into measurable outcomes.
*   **Gender Budget**: A budgeting method that promotes gender equality through resource allocation.

- **Full Budget**:
    - Contains government's estimate for expenditure and receipts for the *entire* financial year.
    - Includes both revenue and capital accounts.
    - Presented and approved for the full fiscal year.

| Feature | Vote-on-Account | Full Budget |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | Deals only with expenditure side | Covers both expenditure and receipts |
| **Period** | For a part of the financial year (e.g., 2 months) | For the entire financial year |
| **Purpose** | To meet immediate expenses before full budget approval | Comprehensive financial plan for the year |
| **Timing** | Used when budget is delayed (e.g., election year) | Presented annually for the upcoming fiscal year |

#### 4. How is the budget process different at the central and state levels in India?
- The text primarily describes the Union Budget process.
- It mentions that State Governments have their own Consolidated Fund, Public Account, and Contingency Fund as mandated by the Constitution.
- It implies that states also have a budget process, but does not detail the differences from the central level.
- For Union Territories without Legislature, their demands for grants are part of the Union budget.

### 4.3 Government Accounts
#### 1. What are the three types of government accounts in India? Describe each briefly.
- The accounts of the Government of India are kept in three parts.

##### Consolidated Fund of India (CFI)
- All revenues (taxes, non-tax receipts) are credited here.
- All loans raised by the government are credited here.
- All expenditures, including debt repayment and loans to states, are debited from here.
- No amount can be withdrawn without Parliament's authorization.

##### Contingency Fund of India
- An imprest (fixed fund) account.
- Kept at the disposal of the President of India.
- Used to meet unforeseen expenses pending Parliament's authorization.
- Money is recouped from CFI after Parliament's approval.
- Corpus increased to Rs. 30,000 crores.

##### Public Account of India
- All public money received by the government, not credited to CFI.
- Receipts and disbursements are not subject to Parliament's vote.
- Examples: Savings Certificates, Provident Funds, Security Deposits.
- Government acts as a Banker or Trustee for these funds.

#### 2. Differentiate between the Consolidated Fund of India, Contingency Fund of India, and Public Account of India.
| Feature | Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) | Contingency Fund of India | Public Account of India |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Receipts** | All revenues (taxes, non-tax), all loans raised | Corpus (initially Rs. 500 cr, now Rs. 30,000 cr) | Public money other than CFI (e.g., small savings, provident funds) |
| **Expenditure** | All government expenditures, debt repayment, loans to states | Unforeseen expenses pending Parliament approval | Disbursements of public money held in trust |
| **Parliamentary Vote** | Requires authorization for withdrawal | Used without prior authorization, but recouped later | Not subject to vote by Parliament |
| **Legal Basis** | Article 266(1) | Article 267(1) | Article 266(2) |
| **Custodian** | Government of India | President of India (via Finance Secretary) | Government of India (as banker/trustee) |

#### 3. What is the significance of the Contingency Fund, and under what circumstances is it used?
- **Significance**:
    - Provides immediate financial relief for unforeseen expenses.
    - Ensures government can respond quickly to emergencies.
    - Avoids delays that would occur if waiting for parliamentary approval.
- **Circumstances of Use**:
    - Natural calamities (e.g., floods, droughts).
    - To implement new policy decisions pending parliamentary approval.
    - Any unforeseen expenses that require immediate funding.

### 4.4 Budget Classification
#### 1. Explain the classification of the budget into revenue and capital budgets.
- The budget is classified into Revenue Budget and Capital Budget.
- This distinction is mandated by Article 112 of the Constitution.

##### Revenue Budget
- Deals with revenue receipts and revenue expenditures.
- **Revenue Receipts**: Neither create liability nor reduce assets. (e.g., taxes, non-tax revenues).
- **Revenue Expenditure**: Neither create assets nor reduce liabilities. (e.g., salaries, pensions, interest payments).

##### Capital Budget
- Deals with capital receipts and capital expenditures.
- **Capital Receipts**: Either create liability or reduce assets. (e.g., borrowings, loan recoveries, disinvestment).
- **Capital Expenditure**: Either create assets or reduce liabilities. (e.g., land acquisition, building, machinery, loans to states).

#### 2. Differentiate between planned and non-planned expenditures. How has this classification evolved post-2017?
- The text does not explicitly differentiate between planned and non-planned expenditures.
- However, it mentions that the "Discontinuation of Plan and Non-plan classification" was a major reform in the Union budget over the last few years.
- This implies that this classification is no longer in use post-2017.

#### 3. What are the major components of capital and revenue expenditures in the government budget?
##### Major Components of Revenue Expenditure
- Expenses for normal functioning of government departments.
- Expenses for various services.
- Interest payments on debt incurred by the central government.
- Grants given to state governments and local bodies.

##### Major Components of Capital Expenditure
- Acquisition of land, building, machinery, equipment.
- Purchase of shares by the government.
- Loans and advances by the central government to state/UT governments.
- Loans and advances to PSUs and other parties.

*Diagram: BUDGET*

        *   **Revenue Exp.**
    *   **Capital Budget**
        *   **Capital Receipts**
        *   **Capital Exp.**

### 4.5 Government Deficits
#### 1. Define and differentiate between revenue deficit, fiscal deficit, and primary deficit.
- **Revenue Deficit**:
    - Difference between government's revenue expenditure and revenue receipts.
    - Formula: Revenue Deficit = Revenue Expenditure - Revenue Receipts.
    - Implies current expenses exceed current revenues.
- **Fiscal Deficit**:
    - Difference between government's total expenditure and total receipts *except borrowings*.
    - Formula: Fiscal Deficit = Total Expenditure - Total Receipts (excluding borrowing).
    - Also equals total borrowing of the government.
    - Key indicator of government's financial health.
- **Primary Deficit**:
    - Fiscal Deficit minus net interest liabilities.
    - Formula: Primary Deficit = Fiscal Deficit - Net interest liabilities.
    - Measures deficit excluding interest payments on previous debt.
    - Focuses on present fiscal imbalances.

| Feature | Revenue Deficit | Fiscal Deficit | Primary Deficit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Rev Exp - Rev Rec | Total Exp - Total Rec (excl. borrowing) | Fiscal Deficit - Net Interest Liabilities |
| **Indicates** | Current expenses > current revenues | Total borrowing of the government | Present fiscal imbalances (excluding past debt service) |
| **Significance** | Government using savings for consumption | Key indicator of financial health/stability | Focus on current year's policy choices |

#### 2. What are the implications of a high fiscal deficit for the Indian economy?
- **Inflationary Pressure**:
    - High fiscal deficit can increase aggregate demand.
    - If resources are fully utilized, firms may not meet demand, leading to price increases.
- **Crowding Out**:
    - Government borrowing to finance deficit competes with private sector for savings.
    - This can reduce funds available for private investment.
- **Debt Burden**:
    - Leads to higher public debt.
    - Requires future repayment and interest servicing.
    - Can become unsustainable if return on investment is lower than borrowing cost.
- **Reduced Productive Spending**:
    - Large revenue deficit within fiscal deficit means borrowing for consumption.
    - May lead to reduction in productive capital expenditure.

#### 3. How does the government finance fiscal deficits, and what are the risks associated with deficit financing?
- **Financing Methods**:
    - **Domestic Borrowing**: Issuing debt securities (Treasury Bills, Dated Securities) to banks, financial institutions, RBI.
    - **Borrowing from RBI**: Through Ways and Means Advances (WMA) for temporary mismatches, or direct monetization in exceptional cases.
    - **Borrowing from Abroad**: Loans from foreign governments and international organizations.
- **Risks of Deficit Financing**:
    - **Inflation**: Increased money supply can lead to inflation.
    - **Increased Debt**: Accumulation of public debt, requiring interest payments.
    - **Crowding Out**: Government borrowing may reduce private investment.
    - **Exchange Rate Impact**: Increased money supply can depreciate currency.
    - **Macroeconomic Instability**: Can impact financial health and stability.

#### 4. Explain the concept of effective revenue deficit and its relevance in fiscal management.
- **Concept**: Effective Revenue Deficit = Revenue Deficit - Grants given to states for creation of capital assets.
- It adjusts revenue deficit by excluding grants that, while revenue expenditure for the Centre, create assets for states.
- **Relevance in Fiscal Management**:
    - Provides a more accurate picture of the government's true consumption spending.
    - Distinguishes between grants for consumption and those for asset creation.
    - Helps assess the quality of government spending.
    - Allows for a better evaluation of fiscal prudence.

### 4.6 Fiscal Policy
#### 1. What is fiscal policy? Discuss its objectives and types.
- **Definition**: Fiscal policy is how government adjusts spending and tax rates.
- It monitors and influences a nation’s economy.
- It is a sister strategy to monetary policy.
- **Objectives**:
    - Economic Growth (stabilization of business cycles).
    - Maintain high level of employment.
    - Control inflation.
    - Equitable distribution of wealth.
    - Welfare (subsidies, income support, health, education).
- **Types**:
    - **Expansionary Fiscal Policy**: Increases spending, reduces tax levels to boost demand.
    - **Contractionary Fiscal Policy**: Reduces spending, increases tax levels to reduce demand.

#### 2. How does fiscal policy help in controlling inflation and stimulating growth?
- **Controlling Inflation (Contractionary Policy)**:
    - Government reduces spending.
    - Increases tax levels to suck money out of the economy.
    - Reduces aggregate demand for goods and services.
    - Lowers the inflation level.
- **Stimulating Growth (Expansionary Policy)**:
    - Government increases spending (e.g., infrastructure).
    - Reduces tax levels (increases disposable income).
    - Fuels aggregate demand.
    - Creates jobs and wages, pumping money into the economy.
    - Rekindles businesses and economic activity.

#### 3. Differentiate between discretionary and automatic fiscal policies.
- The provided text does not explicitly differentiate between discretionary and automatic fiscal policies.
- It discusses counter-cyclical and pro-cyclical fiscal policies.

#### 4. What are fiscal multipliers, and how do they impact economic growth?
- Fiscal multipliers refer to the effect of government expenditure on GDP growth.
- It is the ratio of GDP increase to government spending amount.
- Example: Rs. 1 increase in railway investment increases GDP by Rs. 5.
- **Impact on Economic Growth**:
    - A large multiplier means government spending can significantly boost output.
    - Fiscal policies are more effective in recessions (multipliers are greater).
    - Spending in areas with large multipliers (like infrastructure) can significantly crowd in private investment.
    - This leads to higher economic growth rates.

| Business Cycle Fiscal Policy | Boom | Recession | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pro-Cyclical** | Expenditure increases<br>Tax decreases | Expenditure decreases<br>Tax increases | Deepens recessions and amplifies expansions, thereby increasing fluctuations in the business cycles |
| **Counter Cyclical** | Expenditure decreases<br>Tax increases | Expenditure increases<br>Tax decreases | Softens the recession and moderates the expansions, thereby decreasing fluctuations in the business cycle |

### 4.7 Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003
#### 1. What are the key objectives of the FRBM Act, 2003?
- The FRBM Act 2003 became effective from July 2004.
- Its main objectives were:
    - To ensure inter-generational equity (equality).
    - To achieve long-term macroeconomic stability.
- These were to be achieved by:
    - Achieving sufficient revenue surplus.
    - Removing fiscal obstacles to monetary policy.
    - Effective debt management by limiting deficits and borrowing.

#### 2. Explain the main targets set by the FRBM Act for fiscal deficit and revenue deficit.
- **Fiscal Deficit Target**:
    - Limit fiscal deficit up to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2021.
- **General Government Debt Target**:
    - Not exceed 60% of GDP by 2024-25.
- **Central Government Debt Target**:
    - Not exceed 40% of GDP by 2024-25.
- The Act also aimed for revenue deficit reduction, eventually to zero.

#### 3. How has the FRBM Act been amended over time to account for economic challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic?
- The FRBM Act includes an "escape clause".
- This allows exceeding annual fiscal deficit targets under certain grounds.
- Grounds include national security, war, national calamity, severe agriculture collapse.
- Also, structural reforms with unanticipated fiscal implications.
- Or, decline in real output growth by at least three percentage points.
- Any deviation under this clause shall not exceed 0.5% of GDP in a year.
- Due to Covid-19, fiscal deficit and debt parameters deviated.
- Government stated it would pursue fiscal consolidation to attain <4.5% of GDP by FY 2025-26.
- It did not propose amendment to FRBM law, retaining fiscal flexibility.

#### 4. What are the criticisms and limitations of the FRBM Act in achieving fiscal discipline?
- The text does not explicitly list criticisms and limitations of the FRBM Act.
- However, it mentions that India's fiscal stance has an in-built bias toward higher deficits.
- This implies that achieving strict fiscal discipline has been a challenge.
- The use of the "escape clause" also allows for deviations from targets.

### 4.8 Perspectives on Deficit and Debt
#### 1. How do economists view fiscal deficits in developing economies like India?
- Many economists, including Lord Keynes, advocate small fiscal deficits.
- This is to boost the economy, especially during crises.
- Government should raise public investment by investing borrowed funds.
- The purpose is to accelerate economic growth through public intervention.
- If the return on investments from borrowed funds is higher than borrowing cost, it's fine.
- If government invests in infrastructure, future generations may benefit.
- This is provided the return on investment is greater than the interest rate.
- Growth can lead to debt sustainability if interest rate is less than growth rate.

#### 2. Discuss the relationship between fiscal deficits and public debt.
- Fiscal deficit indicates the total borrowing of the government.
- This borrowing adds to the public debt.
- Public debt is the accumulated debt of the government.
- A large fiscal deficit leads to a higher public debt.
- The growth in debt should be judged by the growth of the economy.
- If borrowed funds are used for consumption, it adds to unproductive debt.

#### 3. What are the long-term implications of unsustainable public debt on economic growth?
- Unsustainable public debt means the debt burden is too large to manage.
- It can lead to higher interest payments, consuming a large part of revenue.
- This reduces funds available for productive investments (e.g., infrastructure, social sectors).
- It can lead to a "debt overhang," discouraging further borrowing and investment.
- It can impact a country's credit rating, making future borrowing more expensive.
- Ultimately, it can hinder long-term economic growth.

#### 4. Explain the concept of the Debt-to-GDP ratio and its significance for fiscal health.
- **Concept**: Debt-to-GDP ratio is the total debt of a country as a percentage of its Gross Domestic Product.
- **Significance for Fiscal Health**:
    - It is a key indicator of a country's fiscal health.
    - A lower ratio indicates a healthier fiscal position.
    - It shows a country's ability to repay its debt.
    - For India, higher GDP growth leads to a lower debt-to-GDP ratio.
    - This is because the interest rate on debt has been less than India's growth rate.

**External Debt of India** = External Debt of India refers to the debt owed to non-residents by the residents of the country (i.e., government and the private sector). As on 30th Sept. 2022, external debt of India was $610.5 Billion (19.2% of GDP).

| EXTERNAL DEBT OF INDIA (as on 30th Sept. 2022) $610.5 billion = 19.2% of GDP | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Sovereign Debt"** | **"Non-Sovereign Debt"** |
| $124.5 billion (3.9% of GDP) | $486 billion (15.3% of GDP) |
| Sovereign Debt is also called Govt. of India (external) Debt<br>(State Govt. external debt is in the name of GoI only) | It includes |
| It includes<br>• FPI/FII investments in G-securities<br>• Loans under Bilateral Assistance<br>• Loans under Multilateral Assistance | • Commercial Borrowing<br>• External Commercial Borrowing ECB plus FII investments in Indian corporate bonds<br>• NRI Deposits |

*   India's external debt can also be classified as 'short-term' (21.6%) and long-term debt.
*   Commercial borrowings remained the largest component of external debt followed by non-resident deposits.
*   Currency wise, India's external debt includes:
    *   US Dollar denominated (55.5%)
    *   Indian Rupee denominated (30%)
    *   And then some is SDR, Yen, Euro.

### 4.9 Monetization of Deficit and Deficit Financing
#### 1. What is monetization of deficit? How is it implemented?
- **Definition**: Monetization of deficit is when the government finances its deficit directly from RBI.
- RBI prints currency and gives it to the government in return for bonds.
- It creates a debt on the Government of India.
- **Implementation**:
    - Before 1997, GoI used to issue ad hoc Treasury Bills to RBI.
    - This practice was stopped in 1997.
    - FRBM Act 2003 also prohibits direct monetization.
    - It is allowed only in exceptional circumstances.

#### 2. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of deficit monetization.
##### Advantages
- Helps in increasing aggregate demand in the economy.
- Results in economic growth.
- Can be used when banks lack sufficient liquidity.
- Avoids increasing interest rates that would hamper investments.

##### Disadvantages
- Increases debt on the Government.
- Impacts overall macroeconomic stability.
- May result in ratings downgrade.
- Increases inflation due to increased money supply.
- May result in rupee depreciation and capital flight.
- RBI can be seen as losing control over its monetary policy.
- Can lure future governments into an easy route of financing deficits.

#### 3. How does the government finance its deficits through borrowing and bonds?
- Government issues debt securities like Treasury Bills and Dated Securities.
- These are purchased by commercial banks, other financial institutions, and RBI.
- It also borrows from abroad through foreign governments and international organizations.
- These borrowings are part of the capital receipts.

#### 4. Explain the difference between internal and external borrowing for deficit financing.
- **Internal Borrowing**:
    - Government borrows from domestic sources.
    - Examples: Issuing Treasury Bills and Dated Securities to Indian banks and public.
- **External Borrowing**:
    - Government borrows from non-residents.
    - Examples: Loans from foreign governments, multilateral agencies (World Bank, ADB).
    - Also includes FPIs purchasing government securities.

### 4.10 Fiscal Council
#### 1. What is a Fiscal Council, and why has it been proposed for India?
- A Fiscal Council is a permanent agency.
- Its mandate is to independently assess government’s fiscal plans and projections.
- It puts its findings in the public domain.
- **Proposed for India because**:
    - India has a chronic problem of fiscal irresponsibility.
    - Government often overstates GDP and revenue projections.
    - It understates expenditures.
    - There is manipulation of budget figures using ‘off-budget’ financing.
    - It aims to bring open scrutiny and accountability to fiscal management.

#### 2. Discuss the potential roles and responsibilities of a Fiscal Council in maintaining fiscal discipline.
- Provide independent assessment of government’s fiscal stance.
- Aid informed debate in Parliament.
- Provide forecasts and advise government on deviation from fiscal rules.
- Provide independent assessments of budget proposals.
- Discipline lawmakers through ‘comply or explain’ obligations.
- Ultimately result in better fiscal performances.

#### 3. How can a Fiscal Council help address challenges in budgetary forecasting and fiscal management?
- It provides independent and expert assessment of fiscal stance.
- This can lead to more accurate budget forecasts.
- It can highlight over-ambitious revenue targets or understated expenditures.
- Its public scrutiny can hold the government accountable for fiscal discipline.
- It can help minimize secrecy in budget preparation.
- It can address issues like manipulation of budget figures through off-budget financing.

### 4.11 India's Tax System
#### 1. Discuss the major features of India's tax system, including its classification into direct and indirect taxes.
- India's tax system includes direct and indirect taxes.
- **Direct Taxes**: Paid directly by individuals or organizations to the government.
    - **Centre**: Personal Income Tax, Corporate Income Tax, MAT, Capital Gain Tax, Equalization Levy.
    - **State**: Land Revenue, Property Tax.
- **Indirect Taxes**: Collected by an intermediary from the person bearing the economic burden.
    - **Centre**: CGST, IGST, Customs Duty.
    - **State**: SGST, Stamp Duty.
- **Other Classifications**: Progressive/Proportional/Regressive, Specific/Ad-valorem, Production/Consumption-based.

        *   **State**
            *   SGST
            *   Stamp Duty

Before GST came into effect on 1st July 2017, Indirect taxes were classified in following way:
*Diagram: Indirect Taxes*
*   **Centre**
    *   Excise Duty
    *   Customs Duty
    *   Service Tax
    *   Central Sales Tax
*   **State**
    *   VAT
    *   Entertainment Tax
    *   Luxury Tax
    *   Entry Tax, Stamp Duty

#### 2. How has the tax-to-GDP ratio evolved in India over the years?
- The text provides a table for "Tax to GDP (Centre)" for recent years.
- For 2022-23, it is 11.1%.
- It does not provide a historical evolution over many years.

#### 3. What are the major challenges in improving tax compliance in India?
- The text does not explicitly list major challenges in improving tax compliance in India.
- However, it mentions that the previous system of tax administration led to overzealous taxmen.
- This implies issues with transparency and fairness in tax collection.
- The introduction of faceless assessment and appeals aims to address these.

#### 4. Explain the role of progressive and regressive taxes in India's fiscal system.
- **Progressive Tax**:
    - Tax percentage increases with an increase in income.
    - Example: Personal Income Tax (higher earners pay a higher percentage).
    - Aims to reduce income inequality.
- **Regressive Tax**:
    - Tax percentage decreases with an increase in income.
    - Example: All indirect taxes (like GST).
    - A poor person pays the same absolute tax as a rich person on a good.
    - This means the poor person pays a higher percentage of their income as tax.
    - Can exacerbate income inequality.
- India's fiscal system uses both to balance revenue generation and equity.

### 4.12 Goods and Services Tax (GST)
#### 1. What are the key features of the GST system in India?
- Most important indirect tax reform since independence.
- Subsumed 17 Central and State indirect taxes.
- One indirect tax on supply of goods and services for the whole nation.
- Made India one unified common market.
- Consists of Central GST (CGST) and States GST (SGST).
- Integrated GST (IGST) levied on inter-State sales.
- Based on value-added tax principle.
- Input Tax Credit mechanism prevents cascading effect.
- GST Council makes recommendations on rates, exemptions, etc.
- Electronic Way Bill (e-way bill) for goods movement.
- Composition levy for small businesses.
- GST Compensation Cess to states for revenue shortfall.

#### 2. Explain the structure of GST, including CGST, SGST, and IGST.
- **CGST (Central GST)**:
    - Levied by the Centre on intra-state supplies of goods and services.
    - Collected by the Central Government.
- **SGST (State GST)**:
    - Levied by the State on intra-state supplies of goods and services.
    - Collected by the State Government.
- **IGST (Integrated GST)**:
    - Levied by the Centre on inter-state supplies of goods and services.
    - Also on imports.
    - Collected by the Central Government.
    - Distributed to the Centre and the consuming State.
- GST is a consumption-based and destination-based tax.

#### 3. What are the advantages of GST over the previous indirect tax system in India?
- **Easy Compliance**: Online services for registration, returns, payments.
- **Uniformity**: Common tax rates and structures across the country.
- **Removal of Cascading**: Seamless tax-credits across states, eliminating tax on tax.
- **Gain to Manufacturers/Exporters**: Reduced cost of manufactured goods, boosting exports.
- **Cooperative Federalism**: Indirect tax decisions taken jointly by Centre and states.
- **Simple to Administer**: One unified tax, backed by robust IT system.
- **Better Controls on Leakage**: Self-policing nature, incentivizing compliance.
- **Increased Tax Base**: More businesses registered, curbing evasion.
- **Higher Revenue Efficiency**: Decreased collection cost.
- **Consumer Benefit**: Single, transparent tax, relief in overall tax burden.
- **Formalization of Industry**: Incentivizes informal sector to formalize for input tax credit.

#### 4. Discuss the challenges in implementing GST, including compliance and revenue collection issues.
- **Complex Rate Structure**: Four-rate structure (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) plus 0% and 3% for gold.
- **Exclusions**: Alcohol, petroleum, electricity, land, real estate outside GST.
- **High Threshold Limit**: Exemption for businesses under Rs. 40 lakhs turnover.
- **Informal Sector Burden**: Many small businesses lack digital literacy, increasing operating costs.
- **Heavy Filing Requirements**: Especially for service providers.
- **Inverted Duty Structure**: Higher GST on inputs than on final products.
- **Compliance Issues**: Making traders move online, quality verification for e-way bills.
- **Revenue Shortfall**: States worried about revenue loss, leading to compensation cess.

#### 5. How has GST impacted inter-state trade and federal fiscal relations in India?
- **Inter-state Trade**:
    - Transformed India into one unified common market.
    - Removed inter-state check posts (Entry Tax).
    - Reduced compliance scrutiny for inter-state movement of goods.
    - Facilitated seamless movement of goods across states.
- **Federal Fiscal Relations**:
    - States gave up right to impose sales tax, Centre gave up excise/service tax.
    - Both get a share of unified GST collected nationally.
    - GST Council (Centre and State ministers) makes joint decisions.
    - This fostered "cooperative federalism".
    - GST Compensation Cess was introduced to address state revenue shortfalls.
    - Supreme Court ruled GST Council recommendations are recommendatory, not binding.

### 4.13 Direct Tax Reforms
#### 1. What are the major reforms introduced in India's direct tax system in recent years?
- **Faceless Assessment**:
    - Cases randomly picked by computer, no face-to-face meetings.
    - Communication only through electronic mode.
    - Improves transparency, efficiency, and governance.
- **Faceless Appeal**:
    - Appeals randomly allotted to any officer in the country.
    - Officer identification remains unknown.
    - Taxpayer not required to visit office.
    - Appellate decision is team-based and reviewed.
- **Taxpayers’ Charter**:
    - Government committed to fair, courteous, and reasonable treatment.
    - Treats taxpayer as honest, provides appeal mechanism.
    - Highlights taxpayer obligations (honest, accurate records, timely response).
- **Corporate Tax Reforms**:
    - Two structures: 25.17% CIT (no exemptions) or 34.94% CIT (with exemptions).
    - Abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT).
- **Personal Income Tax Reforms**:
    - New tax regime with lower rates but no exemptions.
    - Old tax regime with higher rates but exemptions.

#### 2. Explain the significance of the faceless assessment and appeals process in improving tax compliance.
- **Significance**:
    - Improves transparency in tax assessment.
    - Reduces harassment of taxpayers.
    - Eliminates scope for corruption due to human interface.
    - Enhances efficiency and governance in tax administration.
    - Leads to better quality of assessment and monitoring.
    - Encourages better tax compliance by building trust.

#### 3. How has the introduction of new income tax slabs under the optional regime impacted taxpayers?
- The new tax regime offers lower tax rates.
- However, it does not allow any exemptions or rebates.
- Taxpayers have the option to choose between the old and new regimes.
- This impacts taxpayers by requiring them to evaluate which regime is more beneficial.
- It simplifies tax filing for those who prefer not to claim exemptions.
- For those with significant exemptions, the old regime might still be better.

#### 4. Discuss the role of corporate tax reforms in attracting foreign investment.
- Corporate tax reforms have introduced lower tax rates (e.g., 25.17% without exemptions).
- This makes India a more attractive destination for businesses.
- Lower tax burden can increase profitability for foreign companies.
- This encourages Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).
- The abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) also makes investing more appealing.
- It signals a more business-friendly tax environment.

### 4.14 Funds Transfer from Centre to States/UTs
#### 1. What are the main methods of fund transfer from the Centre to states and union territories?
- **Finance Commission Grants**:
    - Vertical devolution (share of central taxes).
    - Grants-in-Aid (Revenue Deficit Grants, Local Body Grants, Disaster Management Grants, Sector Specific Grants, State Specific Grants).
- **Other Grants/Loans/Transfers**:
    - Special Assistance Grants.
    - Additional Central Assistance (Grants and Loans).
    - Assistance from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).
- **Central Sector Schemes (CSs)**: 100% funded by Centre, implemented by central agencies.
- **Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)**: Partially funded by Centre, implemented by states.

#### 2. Explain the role of the Finance Commission in determining fund allocation to states.
- Finance Commission (FC) is appointed by the President every five years.
- **Role**:
    - Recommends distribution of net proceeds of taxes between Centre and states (vertical devolution).
    - Recommends allocation of such proceeds among states (horizontal devolution).
    - Determines principles for grants-in-aid to states from CFI.
    - Suggests measures to augment state consolidated fund for Panchayats/Municipalities.
    - Addresses vertical imbalance (taxation vs. spending powers) and horizontal imbalance (inequality between states).
    - Aims to narrow the development gap between states.

#### 3. How do Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) impact state finances?
- CSSs are partially funded by the Centre (e.g., 50:50, 70:30, 90:10 ratios).
- They are implemented by State Governments.
- They encourage states to prioritize areas requiring more attention (under State List).
- Funds for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Funds of the States.
- They provide additional financial resources to states for specific development programs.
- However, states bear a portion of the funding, impacting their own budgets.
- The sub-group of Chief Ministers recommended categorizing CSSs into Core, Core of the Core, and Optional Schemes.

#### 4. What are the challenges in ensuring equitable and efficient fund distribution between the Centre and states?
- **Challenges**:
    - **Horizontal Imbalance**: Inequality between states at different development stages.
    - **Vertical Imbalance**: Mismatch between taxation powers and expenditure responsibilities.
    - **Conditional Grants**: Tied grants may limit state autonomy in spending.
    - **Implementation Gaps**: Ensuring funds reach intended beneficiaries efficiently.
    - **Data Accuracy**: Reliable data for needs assessment and performance evaluation.
    - **Political Considerations**: Fund allocation can be influenced by political factors.
    - **Fiscal Discipline**: Ensuring states use funds prudently and meet fiscal targets.
- The Finance Commission aims to address these imbalances through its recommendations.

## Indian Economy [1947 - 2014]
### 6.1 Impact of British Rule on Indian Economy
#### 1. What were the major impacts of British colonial policies on Indian agriculture and industry?
- **Agriculture**:
    - Agrarian structure dominated by landlords, moneylenders, merchants, and colonial state.
    - They appropriated over half of total agricultural production.
    - Very little was spent to improve agriculture.
    - Land rights of peasants were unfairly distorted.
    - Led to extreme subdivision and fragmentation of land.
- **Industry**:
    - Rapid collapse of Indian handicraft and artisanal industries.
    - Due to competition from cheaper British manufacturers.
    - Policy of free trade imposed on India.
    - Britain and Europe imposed high import duties on Indian goods.
    - Virtual closing of European markets to Indian manufacturers after 1820.
    - Almost complete absence of heavy or capital goods industries.
    - Industrial development confined to cotton, jute, coal, tea, sugar, cement, paper.
    - Foreign capital dominated industrial and financial fields.

#### 2. Explain the concept of deindustrialization under British rule. How did it affect India's traditional industries?
- **Concept**: Deindustrialization refers to the quick collapse of Indian handicraft and artisanal industries.
- This happened largely due to British policies.
- **Effects on Traditional Industries**:
    - Competition from cheaper imported manufacturers from Britain.
    - Imposition of free trade on India.
    - High import duties imposed by Britain and European countries on Indian goods.
    - This led to the virtual closing of European markets to Indian manufacturers after 1820.
    - Ruined artisans failed to find alternative employment.
    - They crowded into agriculture as tenants, sharecroppers, and laborers.

#### 3. Discuss the role of the Permanent Settlement system in shaping India's agrarian economy.
- Introduced by Lord Cornwallis in Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha in 1793.
- Aimed to impart stability to the revenue system.
- Landlords were accepted as owners of the land, replacing peasants.
- Revenue was collected from landlords, not directly from farmers.
- Zamindars' ownership rights became hereditary and transferable.
- This system distorted land rights of peasants.
- It led to exploitation of farmers by landlords and moneylenders.

#### 4. How did the commercialization of agriculture impact the rural economy in colonial India?
- The text does not explicitly discuss "commercialization of agriculture" as a separate impact.
- However, it mentions that the agrarian structure was dominated by landlords and moneylenders.
- They appropriated a large part of agricultural production.
- This implies a focus on revenue collection rather than rural development.
- The distortion of land rights and crowding of artisans into agriculture also impacted the rural economy.

#### 5. What were the effects of the Drain of Wealth on India's economic structure during British rule?
- **Definition**: "Drain" refers to the unilateral transfer to Britain of social surplus and potential investible capital.
- This was done by the colonial state and its officials from India.
- **Effects on Economic Structure**:
    - A very large part of India's savings was appropriated by the colonial state.
    - Used for military expenditure and colonial administration.
    - Only a very small part was spent on development of agriculture, industry, or social infrastructure.
    - This denied India crucial capital for investment and expansion.
    - Contributed to the complete backwardness and underdevelopment of the Indian economy.

#### 6. Explain how the British transport policy shaped the Indian economy, focusing on railways.
- The provided text does not explicitly discuss British transport policy or railways in this section.

    - Also allowed private property and democracy.
- **Influence of Planning**:
    - Government would plan for the economy.
    - Private sector encouraged to be part of the plan effort.
    - Reflected in Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 and Directive Principles.
    - Planning Commission was set up in 1950, starting five-year plans.

#### 3. What were the objectives and outcomes of the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956?
- **Objectives**:
    - Accepted socialist pattern of society as economic policy objective.
    - Widened the scope of the public sector.
    - Reserved seventeen industries exclusively for the public sector.
    - Industries like iron and steel, mining, machine tools were considered basic.

    - Overregulated private enterprises through licensing system (License Raj).
    - Discouraged foreign capital and competition.
    - Did not deliver social justice and welfare effectively.
    - Resulted in inefficiencies and structural problems in the economy.

#### 4. Discuss the strategies adopted for land reforms post-independence. Were they successful?
- **Strategies**:
    - **Abolition of Intermediaries**: Zamindars, jaghirdars were abolished to link cultivators directly to government.
    - **Tenancy Reforms**: Aimed to guarantee security of tenure, reduce rents, and give ownership rights to tenants.
    - **Ceilings on Landholdings**: Defined maximum land size an individual/family could own for redistribution to landless.
    - **Consolidation of Land Holdings**: Bringing scattered small plots into one compact block.
- **Success**:
    - **Abolition of Intermediaries**: Quite successful, about two crore tenants became landowners.
    - **Tenancy Reforms**: Met with limited success; tenancy pushed underground, tenants became 'farm servants'.
    - **Ceilings on Landholdings**: Met only partial success due to exemptions, benami transfers, judicial interventions.
    - **Consolidation**: Faced obstacles like poor cultivator response, complicated process, lack of political will.
- Overall, land reforms had mixed success, with significant achievements in abolition but limitations in other areas.

#### 5. How did the Green Revolution transform Indian agriculture? What were its limitations?
- **Transformation**:
    - Introduced High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds, fertilizers, pesticides.
    - Improved irrigation facilities and modern agricultural techniques.
    - Led to significant increase in food grain production (e.g., 74 MT in 1966-67 to 105 MT in 1971-72).
    - India became self-sufficient in food grains, reducing imports to nearly zero.
    - Spread to new areas like eastern UP, Andhra Pradesh, and later eastern region.
- **Limitations**:
    - The text does not explicitly list limitations of the Green Revolution in this section.
    - However, it mentions that the strategy underlying the first three plans assumed benefits would trickle down, but growth remained too weak.
    - It also implies that the Green Revolution was supported by huge government subsidies, which is not sustainable.

#### 6. Explain the role of the public sector in India's economic development in the post-independence era.
- The public sector was envisioned to play a progressively active role.
- It was to lead in building key industries and control "commanding heights" of the economy.
- Industries like arms, atomic energy, railways were state monopolies.
- Basic industries (coal, iron, steel) were under central government.
- Massive investments were made in basic and heavy industries.
- It aimed to accelerate industrial development and achieve self-reliance.
- However, it became inefficient, monopolistic, and a consumer of community's savings.
- It failed to generate surpluses and deliver social justice effectively.

### 6.3 Economic Situation After Nehru (1965 – 1991)
#### 1. Discuss the economic challenges faced by India in the post-Nehru period, especially during the 1960s and 1970s.

- Perceived failure of rupee devaluation and trade liberalization.
- Reversal to earlier policies of control and State intervention.

#### 2. How did the wars of 1962, 1965, and 1971 affect India's economy?
- **1962 (China) and 1965 (Pakistan) Wars**:
    - Led to massive increase in defence expenditure.
    - Resulted in government's consolidated fiscal deficit of 7.3% of GDP in 1966-67.
    - Contributed to economic vulnerability with high inflation and low foreign exchange.
- **1971 War**:
    - The text does not explicitly detail the economic impact of the 1971 war in this section.
    - However, it mentions the oil crises of the 1970s as a separate challenge.

#### 3. What were the causes and consequences of the oil crises of the 1970s on India's economy?
- **Causes**:
    - The text mentions "run-away inflation fuelled by hike in oil prices" in the context of the Fifth Plan (1974-79).
    - It does not explicitly detail the causes of the oil crises themselves.
- **Consequences**:
    - Contributed to high inflation.
    - Exacerbated economic crisis.
    - Led to the Fifth Plan being prepared in this backdrop.

#### 4. Explain the concept of the "Hindu Rate of Growth." Why was India's growth sluggish during this period?
- **Concept**: "Hindu Rate of Growth" was a term coined by Prof. Raj Krishna.
- It referred to the 3.5% growth record of the previous three decades (1950s-1980s).
- **Reasons for Sluggish Growth**:
    - Pervasive industrial control through the license raj.
    - Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP) 1969.
    - Nationalization of banks and other industries.
    - Self-sufficiency and inward-looking trade policy.
    - Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI).
    - These structural weaknesses built up in the system.

#### 5. How did the policy of license-permit-quota raj impact industrial growth?
- The license-permit-quota raj was an elaborate and complicated system of controls.
- It controlled entry, expansion of capacity, technology, output mix, location, and import content.
- It created a nightmare for entrepreneurs.
- It thwarted competition, entrepreneurship, and growth.
- It led to endless delays in clearing applications.
- It discouraged efficient and honest entrants.
- It rewarded wily, inefficient producers who manipulated the system.
- This system acquired a vicious stranglehold over the Indian economy.

#### 6. Discuss the economic impact of bank nationalization in 1969.
- **Objectives**: To control commanding heights of the economy and meet development needs.
- **Impact**:
    - Served to intensify social objective of ensuring credit for productive purposes.
    - Led to rapid branch expansion in rural and urban areas.
    - Rapid growth in deposits mobilized by banks.
    - Credit expansions, especially in priority sectors.
    - However, banks became unprofitable, inefficient, and unsound.
    - This was due to poor lending strategy and lack of internal risk management.
    - Fostered rigidities and inefficiencies in the commercial banking system.

#### 7. What were the key measures introduced during the Janata Party's tenure (1977–1980) for economic reform?
- The text mentions that the Janata Government put forward a plan for 1978-1983.
- This plan emphasized employment, contrasting with the Nehru Model.
- It criticized the Nehru Model for power concentration, inequality, and poverty.
- The text does not detail specific economic reform measures introduced by the Janata Party.

#### 8. How did the Balance of Payments (BoP) crisis of the late 1980s set the stage for economic reforms in 1991?
- In the second half of the 1980s, there was enormous trade deficit.
- Imports were nearly double that of exports.
- India resorted to more short-term borrowings.
- Government indulged in fiscal profligacy (substantial borrowing).
- This led to weak macroeconomic fundamentals (high fiscal deficit, current account deficit, inflation, external debt).
- Foreign exchange reserves were critically low ($1 billion by June 1991).
- India's international credit rating was sharply downgraded.
- It became extremely difficult to raise credit abroad.
- Government was forced to pledge gold as collateral to raise funds.
- The country was at the edge of default, necessitating economic reforms.

### 6.4 Economic Reforms of 1991 (LPG Reforms)
#### 1. What were the key factors that necessitated the Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG) reforms in 1991?
- **Weak Macroeconomic Fundamentals**:
    - Fiscal deficit of 8.4% of GDP in 1990-91.
    - Current account deficit of 3.1%.
    - High inflation of 17%.
    - High external debt.
- **Balance of Payments Crisis**:
    - Short-term debt of about $6 billion, with $2 billion rolled over daily.
    - Rapid withdrawal of NRI deposits (over $10 billion).
    - Foreign exchange reserves down to $1 billion (enough for fortnight's imports).
    - Iraqi invasion of Kuwait (1990) increased oil prices and import bill.
    - Fall in Indian exports to Middle East.
    - India's international credit rating sharply downgraded.
    - Difficulty in raising foreign credit.
    - Forced to pledge 67 tonnes of gold as collateral.
- **Structural Weaknesses**: Pervasive industrial control (license raj), MRTP Act, nationalization, inward-looking trade policy.

#### 2. Explain the structural changes introduced under the LPG reforms. Focus on industry, trade, and financial sectors.
- **Industrial Policy**:
    - Abolished pervasive industrial licensing (License Raj).
    - Eliminated controls over investment and expansion by large industrial houses (MRTP Act).
    - Drastically pruned industries reserved for public sector.
    - Opened critical areas (power, hydrocarbon, air transport, telecom) to private sector.
    - De-licensed items reserved for MSME sector.
- **Trade and Exchange Rate Policy**:
    - Dismantled complex import control regime for raw materials, inputs, capital goods.
    - Allowed free import of most goods (except negative list).
    - Gradual lowering of customs duties.
    - Rupee devalued by 24% in July 1991.
    - Moved to market-based exchange rate system (managed float) in March 1993.
    - Rupee made fully convertible at current account.
- **Financial Sector Reforms**:
    - Banking sector opened to private competition (new private banks).
    - SEBI established as independent statutory authority for capital markets.
    - Capital market opened for portfolio investments.
    - Indian companies allowed to access international capital markets (GDRs).
    - Abolished government control over capital issues and pricing (repealed Capital Issues Control Act).

#### 3. How did the devaluation of the rupee in 1991 impact India's foreign trade?
- The rupee was devalued by about 24% in July 1991.
- This was done for alignment of the exchange rate with the market rate.
- Devaluation makes exports cheaper for foreign buyers.
- It makes imports more expensive for domestic buyers.
- This typically boosts exports and curbs imports.
- The text states that exports more than doubled from 1990-91 to 1993-94.

#### 4. Discuss the significance of the New Industrial Policy of 1991 in promoting economic liberalization.
- The New Industrial Policy brought radical changes.
- It abolished the system of pervasive industrial licensing (License Raj).
- It eliminated controls over investment and expansion by large industrial houses (MRTP Act).
- It drastically pruned the list of industries exclusively reserved for the public sector.
- Many critical areas like power, air transport, telecom were opened for private sector.
- This promoted competition and reduced government intervention.
- It aimed to create an environment comparable to other developing countries.

#### 5. How did the removal of import licensing and tariff reductions promote globalization in India?
- **Removal of Import Licensing**:
    - Raw materials, other inputs, and capital goods could be freely imported.
    - This integrated Indian production with global supply chains.
    - Reduced restrictions on international trade.
- **Tariff Reductions (Lowering Customs Duties)**:
    - Made imported goods cheaper.
    - Increased competition for domestic industries from foreign goods.
    - Encouraged Indian industries to become more globally competitive.
- These measures facilitated the flow of goods, services, capital, and labor across international borders, promoting globalization.

#### 6. Explain the role of disinvestment in promoting privatization post-1991 reforms.
- Disinvestment was a critical element in structural adjustment programs.
- Government initiated a limited process of selling its ownership/equity in PSUs.
- The government generally retained 51% of equity and management control.
- This signaled that PSUs must finance investment from internal resources or capital markets.
- It encouraged efficiency and commercial orientation in public sector companies.
- Budgetary support to loss-making PSUs was phased out.
- This was a step towards transferring business from public to private ownership.

#### 7. What were the outcomes of LPG reforms in terms of GDP growth, employment, and poverty reduction?
- **GDP Growth**: Increased from 1.1% in 1991-92 to 4% in 1992-93.
- Moved on a higher growth trajectory of 6.3% in post-reform period.
- **Employment**: The post-reform period has been termed as jobless growth.
- Not enough employment opportunities were created for youth.
- **Poverty Reduction**: Accelerated reduction in poverty post-reform.
- Proportion of population below poverty line fell from 36% (1993-94) to 21.9% (2011-12).
- Growth helped raise more resources for social sector expenditures.
- However, inequality increased in the post-reform period.

#### 8. Critically analyze the limitations of the LPG reforms, especially concerning income inequality and sectoral imbalances.
- **Income Inequality**:
    - Gini coefficient in income increased from 0.52 (2004-05) to 0.55 (2011-12).
    - Inequality in income and wealth is much higher than consumption.
    - People with financial/educational resources multiplied wealth faster than the poor.
- **Sectoral Imbalances**:
    - Economy jumped from agriculture to services, ignoring manufacturing.
    - Manufacturing sector faced bottlenecks (land, transport, electricity, labor laws).
    - Rural economy remained weak, leading to less demand for manufactured products.
    - This resulted in low growth in rural productivity.
- **Jobless Growth**: Not enough well-paid jobs created for the youth.
- **Persistent Poverty**: Many Indians remained poor, deprived of basic amenities.
- **Governance Issues**: Poor governance and corruption remained constraints.
- **Redistribution vs. Opportunity**: Reforms did not fully address equality of opportunity.

### 6.5 Economy Jumped from Agriculture to Services
#### 1. Discuss the structural transformation of the Indian economy post-1991, focusing on the shift from agriculture to services.
- At independence (1947), agriculture was 55% of GDP, services 30%, industry 15%.
- Post-1991, Indian economy shifted directly from agriculture to services.
- Services now constitute 54% share in India's GDP.
- This is an exception to the usual path of agriculture to industry then services.
- The vast entrepreneurial talent moved into the services sector.
- This was propelled by internet and telecom revolution.

#### 2. Why did the manufacturing sector fail to emerge as the dominant sector during India's economic transformation?
- **Infrastructural Bottlenecks**:
    - Difficult land acquisition processes.
    - Poor and costly transportation infrastructure (railways, roads).
    - Inefficient ports leading to delays in trade.
    - Lack of 24x7 availability of cheap power.
- **Regulatory and Labor Issues**:
    - Complicated labor laws (e.g., ID Act, Contract Labour Act).
    - Difficult to fire workers, deterring hiring.
    - Multitude of inconsistent labor laws.
    - Time-consuming and difficult government approvals/clearances.
- **Lack of Economies of Scale**: Reservation policies for small scale firms.
- **Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI)**: Failed to make a timely shift from export pessimism.
- **Competition**: Manufacturing is shrinking globally, and India faces competition from China.

#### 3. Explain the role of IT and IT-enabled services in driving India's service sector growth.
- The economic reforms of 1991 opened product and capital markets.
- This period coincided with the internet and telecom revolution in India.
- This provided a necessary ingredient for services growth.
- Vast entrepreneurial talent moved into the services sector.
- This propelled the growth of the Indian economy.
- IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) became a significant part of this growth.

#### 4. How did globalization contribute to the rapid growth of India's service sector?
- Globalization facilitated the flow of technology and capital.
- The internet and telecom revolution, a key aspect of globalization, enabled services.
- It allowed Indian service firms to access global markets.
- This led to rapid growth in IT and IT-enabled services.
- Foreign firms were allowed in India, increasing competition and opportunities.
- This helped Indian entrepreneurs to leverage global demand for services.

#### 5. Discuss the implications of the service-led growth model on employment generation in India.
- The services sector employs **fairly** **skilled** people.
- India's most abundant resource is **unskilled** **labour**.
- The service-led growth model has not provided employment to large unskilled population.
- This has led to a "jobless growth" phenomenon.
- 12 million people enter the Indian workforce each year, many low-skilled.
- The scale and nature of employment required for them can only be provided by low and semi-skilled manufacturing.
- This creates a challenge for India's demographic dividend.

#### 6. What are the challenges associated with an economy that skips industrialization in favor of services?
- **Employment**: Services sector employs skilled labor, leaving large unskilled population unemployed/underemployed.
- **Productivity**: Moving farmers directly to service jobs en masse has not led to high income levels in other countries.
- **Imitation**: Manufacturing technologies are easier to imitate than service productivity (organizational models, human capital).
- **Global Trends**: Manufacturing is shrinking globally, making it harder to catch up.
- **Competition**: India faces competition from China in manufacturing exports.
- **Income Disparity**: Can exacerbate income inequality if benefits are not broad-based.

#### 7. How does India's sectoral composition compare with other developing and developed countries?
- Generally, economies move from agriculture to industry (manufacturing) and then to services.
- India is an exception, shifting directly from agriculture to services.
- **India's Composition (2022-23)**: Agriculture 16%, Industry 30%, Services 54%.
- **India's Labor Force (2022-23)**: Agriculture 43%, Industry 25%, Services 32%.
- This contrasts with countries that had a strong manufacturing phase.
- China, for example, had rapid industrialization, moving millions from agriculture to factories.
- The text implies that India's path is unique and poses specific challenges.

### 6.6 Planning Commission and Five-Year Plans
#### 1. What was the role of the Planning Commission in India's economic development?
- The Planning Commission was set up in March 1950.
- It was the premier body for policymaking and governance.
- **Role**:
    - Assess country's material, capital, and human resources.
    - Devise plans for effective and balanced resource utilization.
    - Define stages of plan implementation and allocate resources.
    - Specify factors retarding economic development.

    - Provide social services.
- **Outcomes**:
    - Successful plan due to good harvests in last two years.
    - Objectives of refugee rehabilitation, food self-sufficiency, and price control were largely achieved.
    - Actual growth (3.6%) exceeded target growth (2.1%).

#### 3. How did the Second Five-Year Plan (1956–61) focus on industrialization and the development of the public sector?
- **Focus**:
    - Rapid industrialization, especially heavy and basic industries.
    - Advocated huge imports through foreign loans.
    - Based on Prof. PC Mahalanobis's strategy for resource allocation.
    - Aimed to establish a socialistic pattern of society.
    - Promoted rapid development of heavy and capital goods industries in the public sector.
    - Hydroelectric power projects, steel plants (Bhillai, Durgapur, Rourkela) were established.
- **Development of Public Sector**:
    - Public sector was to build key industries and control "commanding heights".
    - Industrial Policy 1956 reserved seventeen industries exclusively for public sector.

#### 4. What were the key challenges faced during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961–66), and how were they addressed?
- **Challenges**:
    - Chinese aggression (1962).
    - Indo-Pak war (1965).
    - Severe drought in 1965-66.
- **Addressing Challenges**:
    - The approach shifted from development to defence and development due to conflicts.
    - The plan was a thorough failure in reaching its targets.

#### 5. Explain the rationale behind the Plan Holiday (1966–69). What were its outcomes?
- **Rationale**:
    - Failure of the Third Plan.
    - Failure of rupee devaluation to boost exports.
    - Inflationary recession.
    - These factors led to the postponement of the Fourth Five-Year Plan.
- **Outcomes**:
    - Three Annual Plans were introduced instead.
    - Emphasis was placed on agriculture due to prevailing crisis and food shortage.
    - A new agricultural strategy was implemented (HYV seeds, fertilizers, irrigation).

#### 6. Discuss the strategy of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969–74) in addressing food security and industrial stagnation.
- **Strategy**:
    - Twin objectives of "growth with stability" and "progressive achievement of self-reliance".
    - Main emphasis on growth rate of agriculture to support other sectors.
    - This was influenced by refusal of essential equipment supply during Indo-Pak war.
- **Outcome**: The plan was considered a failure in achieving its targets.

#### 7. How did the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974–79) prioritize poverty alleviation and self-reliance?
- **Priorities**:
    - Proposed to achieve two main objectives: "removal of poverty" (Garibi Hatao).
    - And "attainment of self-reliance".
- **Key Instruments**:
    - Promotion of high rate of growth.
    - Better distribution of income.

### 8.2 Poverty Estimation in India
#### 1. What are the different methods used to estimate poverty in India?
- Poverty estimation in India has a long history of studies.
- The best approach is to look at it in terms of minimum consumption expenditure per person/household.
- This minimum expenditure is derived from minimum expenditure on food and non-food items.
- Minimum food consumption is related to nutritional standards.
- Official data used to be based on consumption expenditure data collected by NSSO.
- Various expert groups (Lakdawala, Tendulkar, Rangarajan) used per capita consumption estimates.
- **Multidimensional Poverty Indices (MPI)** also provide a holistic view.
- **Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011** is used for identification of poor.

#### 2. Discuss the Tendulkar Committee's recommendations for poverty estimation.
- Tendulkar Committee (2005) estimated poverty based on consumption expenditure.
- It set a poverty line of less than Rs. 27 per day in rural areas.
- And less than Rs. 33 per day in urban areas.
- It arrived at a cut-off of **21.9%** of the population as BPL in 2011-12.
- This estimate faced backlash due to its low threshold.

#### 3. How does the Rangarajan Committee's methodology differ from earlier poverty estimation methods?
- Rangarajan Committee (2012) was appointed to review Tendulkar's methodology.
- It raised the poverty limits compared to Tendulkar's.
- It set limits to Rs. 32 per day in rural areas.
- And Rs. 47 per day in urban areas.
- It estimated poverty line at **29.5%** in 2011-12.
- This methodology provided a higher poverty estimate than Tendulkar's.

#### 4. What are the criticisms of poverty estimation methods in India?
- Defining a poverty line has always been controversial.
- Tendulkar committee's low thresholds (Rs. 27/33 per day) faced backlash.
- Critics argue that these amounts are too low for a decent standard of living.
- The methods primarily focus on consumption expenditure.
- They may not fully capture multi-dimensional aspects of poverty (deprivations).
- The new NDA government has not accepted Tendulkar or Rangarajan estimates.
- NITI Aayog has been tasked to define a new poverty line.

#### 5. How do multidimensional poverty indices (MPI) provide a holistic view of poverty?
- MPIs focus on deprivations beyond just income or consumption.
- They capture multiple dimensions of poverty.
- Example: SECC 2011 captured data on housing, deprivation, employment, assets, landownership.
- It allows tracking deprivation of households.
- It addresses gaps effectively with a focus on multi-dimensionality.
- It helps in evidence-based developmental interventions.
- It leads to selection of right beneficiaries and minimizes duplication/fraud.
- This goes beyond income or expenditure-based poverty.

### 8.3 Demographic Dividend
#### 1. What is the demographic dividend, and how can India benefit from it?
- **Definition**: Demographic dividend is an episode of higher economic growth.
- It is driven by changes in the age structure of the population.
- It is the additional growth due to demographic factors alone.
- The specific variable is the ratio of working age (WA) population (20-59) to non-working age (NWA) population.
- **Benefits for India**:
    - India's demographic cycle is 10-30 years behind other countries (China, Korea).
    - Next few decades present an opportunity for India to catch up in per capita income.
    - Both level and growth of WA/NWA ratio positively impact economic activity.
    - It can lead to higher economic growth.

#### 2. Discuss the challenges India faces in leveraging its demographic dividend.

- Over 90% of workers in informal economy with low productivity.
- **Sectoral Imbalance**: Economy jumped to services, ignoring manufacturing.
- Manufacturing needs to create jobs for low-skilled workers.
- **Regional Heterogeneity**: Divide between peninsular and hinterland states in demographic profile.
- **Aging Population**: Share of elderly population is rising, requiring attention.
- If not leveraged, demographic dividend can become a "demographic nightmare" of unemployment.

#### 3. How does the demographic transition impact economic growth?
- Demographic transition involves changes in age structure.
- A rising share of working-age population (demographic dividend) positively impacts growth.
- This is due to increased labor supply and potential for higher savings/investment.
- A declining share of young population and rising elderly population indicates aging.
- This can slow down the positive impact of the demographic dividend.
- It shifts policy concerns towards needs of the elderly.

#### 4. Explain the role of education and skill development in maximizing the demographic dividend.
- Education and skill development are crucial for leveraging the dividend.
- They enhance the quality of the workforce.
- They address the challenge of non-employability of youth.
- They provide job skills required by the economy.
- This helps in creating productive employment opportunities.
- It allows the large working-age population to contribute effectively to economic growth.
- Without adequate skills, the demographic dividend can turn into a "demographic nightmare".

#### 5. Compare India's demographic dividend with that of other countries like China.
- India's demographic cycle is about 10-30 years behind countries like China and Korea.
- This indicates a longer window of opportunity for India.
- China has already leveraged its demographic dividend.
- China moved hundreds of millions of farmers to factories.
- India's challenge is to catch up to their per capita income levels.
- India has a large heterogeneity among states in demographic evolution.
- This creates "two Indias" with different policy concerns (aging vs. young).

- The text states that the new Industrial Relations Code 2020 has made fixed-term employment applicable for all industries.
- This ensures a pan-India implementation.
- The text does not explicitly compare India's fixed-term employment policies with global practices.

### 8.6 Migrant Labour
#### 1. What are the key challenges faced by migrant labourers in India?
- Treated as second-class citizens.
- Lack of proper accommodation and low standard of living.
- Low wages.
- Inaccessibility to state-given services due to lack of identity proof.
- Unable to speak the local language (lingua franca).
- Rarely represented by unions or social movements.
- Easily harassed by employers, government institutions, and other workers.
- Vulnerability makes them easily controlled, cheap, and dispensable.
- Receive no formal government support (unlike farmers or rural laborers).

#### 2. Discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrant labour in India.
- The text does not explicitly discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrant labor in this section.
- However, it mentions that the Code on Social Security, 2020, aims to provide social security benefits to all workers, including unorganized sector.
- This implies a recognition of the vulnerabilities highlighted by events like the pandemic.

#### 3. What are the provisions of the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, 1979?
- The Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979, was passed to protect migrant laborers.
- This Act has now been replaced by The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020.
- Therefore, its specific provisions are no longer directly relevant as a standalone act.

#### 4. How can government policies address the issues of social security and welfare for migrant labourers?
- **New Labour Codes (Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020)**:
    - Defines inter-state migrant worker (wages up to Rs. 18,000/month).
    - Central and State Governments to maintain database/record.
    - Employer responsible for suitable work conditions.
    - Extend all benefits (PF, insurance, medical check-up) available to other workers.
    - Employer to pay lump sum fare for journey to native place.
    - Government to make scheme for PDS benefits in native or employed state.
- **Code on Social Security, 2020**:
    - Proposes social security benefits to all workers, including unorganized sector.
    - Aims for universalization of social security.

#### 5. Explain the significance of portability of welfare benefits for migrant workers.
- The new Code, 2020, aims to provide an option for inter-state migrant workers.
- They can avail benefits of PDS either in their native state or where they are employed.
- This is significant because migrant workers often lose access to benefits when they move.
- Portability ensures continuous access to essential services like food.
- It addresses the challenge of lack of identity proof and inaccessibility to state services.
- This improves their social security and welfare.

### 8.7 Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO)
#### 1. What is the Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO), and what are its key functions?
- **Definition**: EPFO is a statutory body.

- **EPF Scheme**:
    - Workers (salary up to Rs. 15,000) contribute 12% of basic salary.
    - Employer contributes matching amount.
    - Provides a retirement savings fund.
- **EPS Scheme**:
    - Provides pension after retirement (age 58).
    - Employer contributes 8.33% of basic salary to EPS.
    - Government of India contributes 1.16%.
    - Ensures old age security.

#### 3. What are the key reforms introduced in EPFO post-2014?
- The text mentions the Supreme Court judgment of November 2022.
- This judgment clarified eligibility for EPS for those who joined on or after Sept 1, 2014.
- It also clarified the maximum pensionable salary (Rs. 15,000).
- The text also states that "The Code on Social Security 2020" will repeal the 1952 Act.
- This implies new rules and regulations for EPFO will kick in.

#### 4. Discuss the challenges in extending EPFO benefits to informal sector workers.
- The text states that the Code on Social Security, 2020, proposes social security benefits to all workers.
- This includes those in the unorganized sector.
- It aims for universalization of social security.
- However, it does not explicitly detail the challenges in extending EPFO benefits to informal sector workers.
- Implicit challenges could include lack of formal employment records, irregular income, and low awareness.

#### 5. How does the Universal Account Number (UAN) simplify EPFO operations?

- Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the provided text.

### 8.8 National/New Pension System (NPS)
#### 1. What is the National Pension System (NPS), and how does it differ from traditional pension schemes?
- **Definition**: NPS is a pension-cum-investment scheme.
- Launched by Government of India to provide old age security.
- Administered and regulated by PFRDA.
- **Differences from Traditional Pension Schemes (OPS)**:
    - **Contribution**: NPS requires employee contribution (10% of salary) and employer contribution (10-14%). OPS had no employee contribution.
    - **Benefit**: NPS requires purchasing an annuity plan with accumulated corpus (min 40%). OPS provided 50% of last drawn salary as pension.
    - **Flexibility**: NPS offers choice of fund managers and equity/debt investment percentage. OPS had fixed benefits.
    - **Sustainability**: OPS became unsustainable due to rising life expectancy. NPS is designed to be more sustainable.

#### 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of the NPS for government and private sector employees.
##### Benefits
- **For Government Employees**:
    - Employer contribution (enhanced to 14% for Central Govt.).
    - Provides old age security.

- **For Private Sector Employees**:
    - The text does not explicitly list challenges for private sector employees.
- **General Challenges**:
    - The text does not explicitly list challenges for NPS.

#### 3. How does the NPS contribute to financial security post-retirement?
- NPS is designed to provide old age security to citizens.
- Employees contribute a portion of their salary, matched by employers (for government).
- This builds an accumulated corpus over their working life.
- At retirement, a portion of this corpus must be used to purchase an annuity plan.
- This annuity provides a regular monthly pension.
- The remaining corpus can be withdrawn as a lump sum.
- This ensures a financial stream post-retirement.

#### 4. Compare the Atal Pension Yojana with the NPS in terms of inclusivity and coverage.
- The provided text describes NPS in detail.
- It does not mention or compare Atal Pension Yojana with NPS.
- Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the provided text.

#### 5. What reforms can enhance the penetration of the NPS in rural and informal sectors?
- The text does not explicitly discuss reforms to enhance NPS penetration in rural and informal sectors.
- It mentions that any individual (aged 18-70) can join NPS on a voluntary basis.
- This implies that voluntary participation is the current mechanism for broader coverage.

### 8.9 Informal and Formal Economy
#### 1. Differentiate between the informal and formal economy with examples.
- **Informal/Unorganized Sector**:
    - Not registered, not taxed, not monitored by government.
    - Sometimes has less than 10 workers.
    - Examples: Own account enterprises (OAEs), household units, street vendors.
    - Sub-sectors: manufacturing, construction, trade (wholesale and retail).
- **Formal/Organized Sector**:
    - Registered, taxed, and monitored by government.
    - Subject to labor laws and regulations.
    - Firms employing more than 100 workers (historically).
    - Examples: Large corporations, government entities.

| Feature | Informal Economy | Formal Economy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Registration** | Not registered | Registered |
| **Taxation** | Not taxed | Taxed |
| **Monitoring** | Not monitored by government | Monitored by government |
| **Labor Laws** | Largely untouched by strict labor laws | Subject to strict labor laws |
| **Productivity** | Lower productivity | Much more productive |
| **Examples** | Street vendors, small household units | Large factories, corporate offices |

#### 2. Discuss the challenges in formalizing the informal economy in India.
- **Competitive Pressure**: Informal sector competes with formal sector due to low wages.
- **Labor Laws**: Strict labor laws for formal enterprises incentivize subcontracting to informal sector.
- **Lack of Employment Opportunities**: Formal sector does not create enough jobs.
- **Low Productivity**: Informal units lack financial resources, technical expertise, professional management.
- **Compliance Burden**: Many informal firms lack digital literacy, increasing operating costs for compliance.
- **Tax Evasion**: Informal sector operates outside the tax net.

#### 3. What are the key government initiatives to formalize the informal sector, such as GST and Digital India?
- **GST (Goods and Services Tax)**:
    - GST regime is good at formalizing areas where formal sector interacts with informal.
    - Incentivizes formal sector to bring informal supply chain into tax net for input tax credit.
    - Thousands of informal MSMEs have registered for GST.
    - Brought informal enterprises into formal economy, curbed tax evasion.
- **Digital India**:
    - The text implies that digital initiatives (like GST's IT infrastructure) support formalization.
    - It mentions that many informal firms lack digital literacy, which is a challenge.
- **New Labour Codes**:
    - Code on Social Security proposes benefits for unorganized workers.
    - Aims for universalization of social security.
    - Occupational Safety Code makes employment letter a must, promoting formalization.

#### 4. How does the informal economy contribute to employment generation and GDP in India?
- **Employment Generation**:
    - Retained considerable importance in employment.
    - More than 90% of total labor force (52 crore) is employed in informal sector.
    - Accounts for a dominant share of informal sector employment in manufacturing, construction, trade.
- **GDP Contribution**:
    - Contributed more than 30% to the total output/GDP of India.
- It provides livelihoods for a large population, especially those with low skills.

#### 5. What are the socio-economic implications of a large informal sector?
- **Low Wages**: Due to lower productivity and lack of formalization.
- **No Social Security**: Workers often lack benefits like PF, pension, insurance.
- **Stagnant Skills**: Workers unable to upgrade skills, stuck in same tasks.
- **Poverty**: Hinders overall progress and keeps workers destitute.
- **Inequality**: Contributes to income inequality.
- **Exploitation**: Workers are vulnerable to exploitation.
- **Hindrance to Inclusive Growth**: Prevents poor from being brought into formal employment.
- **Reduced Tax Base**: Operates outside the tax net, reducing government revenue.

### 8.10 Unemployment and Its Types
#### 1. What are the different types of unemployment in India? Explain with examples.
- **Structural Unemployment**:
    - Caused by fundamental shifts in the economy.
    - Workers lack requisite job skills, or jobs are far from workers.
    - Mismatch between company needs and worker skills.
    - Example: Handloom weavers losing jobs due to machine weaving.
- **Cyclical Unemployment**:
    - Occurs due to cyclical trends in the business cycle.
    - Low when economic activity is high (peak), rises when output falls (low).
    - Overall demand for labor declines due to business downturns.
- **Frictional Unemployment**:
    - Arises due to people moving between jobs, careers, or locations.
    - Also from people entering/exiting the labor force.
    - Transitional unemployment, always present in economy.
    - Example: A person leaving one job to find a new one.
- **Seasonal Unemployment**:
    - Occurs when people are unemployed at certain times of the year.
    - Due to seasonal demand in industries.
    - Example: Tourism, farming, sugar factory workers during off-season.
- **Disguised Unemployment**:
    - Part of labor force is without work or working redundantly.
    - Overall productivity of labor is very less, marginal productivity is zero.
    - Frequent in developing countries with large populations.
    - Example: Agriculture sector in India.
- **Open Unemployment**:
    - All those who are not working due to lack of work but actively seek work.
    - Clearly visible in society.
    - Example: People standing in areas looking for daily work.

*Diagram: Types of Unemployment*
*   **Open Unemployment**: Visible job-seeking without available work.
*   **Structural Unemployment**: Caused by economic shifts and skill mismatches.
*   **Cyclical Unemployment**: Fluctuates with business cycle peaks and troughs.
*   **Frictional Unemployment**: Occurs during job transitions and information gaps.
*   **Seasonal Unemployment**: Linked to seasonal demand in specific industries.
*   **Disguised Unemployment**: Involves redundant labor with low productivity.

#### 2. Discuss the causes and consequences of structural unemployment.
- **Causes**:
    - Workers lacking requisite job skills.
    - Change in government policy.
    - Change in technology.
    - Workers living far from available jobs and unable/unwilling to move.
    - Existing wage levels being too low.
    - Mismatch between company needs and worker skills.
- **Consequences**:
    - Longer lasting form of unemployment.
    - Jobs are available, but people are not qualified to fill them.
    - Can lead to a persistent pool of unemployed individuals.
    - Hinders economic growth by not fully utilizing labor force.

#### 3. How does disguised unemployment impact rural economies?
- Disguised unemployment means part of the labor force is working redundantly.
- Overall productivity of labor is very less, marginal productivity is zero.
- **Impact on Rural Economies**:
    - Large populations in developing countries create labor surplus.
    - Many people are engaged in agriculture, even if their contribution is minimal.
    - This leads to low per worker productivity in agriculture.
    - It keeps incomes low in rural areas.
    - It hinders the shift of workforce to more productive sectors.

#### 4. What is cyclical unemployment, and how does it relate to economic slowdowns?
- **Definition**: Cyclical unemployment occurs due to cyclical trends in the business cycle.
- **Relation to Economic Slowdowns**:
    - When economic output (GDP) falls (slowdown/recession), the business cycle is low.
    - During slowdowns, overall demand for labor declines.
    - Businesses reduce hiring or lay off workers due to decreased demand.
    - This causes cyclical unemployment to rise.
    - It is a direct consequence of economic contractions.

#### 5. Explain the concept of frictional unemployment and its impact on the labour market.
- **Concept**: Frictional unemployment arises due to people moving between jobs, careers, or locations.
- It also occurs when people enter and exit the labor force.
- It is a result of workers and employers having inconsistent or incomplete information.
- It is also called transitional unemployment.
- **Impact on Labour Market**:
    - Always present in the economy.
    - Does not necessarily indicate a weak economy.
    - Can occur even at "full employment".
    - Reflects the natural dynamism of the labor market.
    - Workers take time to find new jobs, and employers take time to select.

### 8.11 Underemployment
#### 1. What is underemployment, and how is it different from unemployment?
- **Definition**: Underemployment is a situation where a worker is employed, but not in the desired capacity.
- This can be in terms of compensation, skill level, experience, education, or availability.
- **Difference from Unemployment**:
    - **Unemployment**: Worker is not employed and actively looking for a job.
    - **Underemployment**: Worker *is* employed, but their skills/potential are not fully utilized.
    - Underemployed workers are not technically unemployed.

#### 2. Discuss the causes of underemployment in rural and urban areas.
- **General Causes**:
    - Indian entrepreneurs investing only in capital-intensive or high-skill businesses.
    - These sectors do not create well-paid jobs for those at the bottom of the pyramid.
    - Lack of well-paid jobs for those migrating from agriculture.
    - Over 90% of workforce in informal/unorganized sector with low productivity.
- **Rural Areas**:
    - Disguised unemployment in agriculture, where people are redundant.
    - Lack of sufficient non-farm opportunities.
- **Urban Areas**:
    - People with low skills/education migrating from rural areas.
    - Taking up low-paying, low-skill jobs despite having some skills.
    - Part-time workers preferring full-time hours.

#### 3. How does underemployment affect economic growth and productivity?
- **Economic Growth**:
    - Underemployed workers have less disposable income, leading to less spending.
    - This impacts aggregate demand and slows down economic growth.
    - It hinders the transition of the workforce to more productive sectors.
- **Productivity**:
    - Leads to lower overall productivity in the economy.
    - Skills and potential of workers are not fully utilized.
    - Rampant underemployment is a serious problem for productivity.
    - It keeps wages low, perpetuating a cycle of low productivity.

#### 4. What measures can be taken to address underemployment in India?
- **Shift Workforce**: Move workforce away from agriculture to non-farm activities.
- **Promote Manufacturing**: Build infrastructure that supports unskilled intensive manufacturing.
- **Skill Development**: Focus on "Skilling India" aggressively.
- **Entrepreneurship**: Encourage investment in clothing, light manufacturing, food processing.
- **Formalization**: Bring more workers into the formal/organized sector.
- **Government and Industry Action**: Take underemployment on a war footing.

#### 5. How do MGNREGA and similar schemes help mitigate underemployment?
- The text mentions MGNREGA as a government program to address income disparities.
- It is a guaranteed rural job scheme.
- While it provides employment, the text does not explicitly state how it mitigates underemployment.
- However, by providing guaranteed work, it can offer a safety net for those who are underemployed or seasonally unemployed.
- It can provide alternative employment during lean agricultural seasons.

### 8.12 PLFS and AQEES
#### 1. What is the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), and how does it measure employment trends?
- **Definition**: PLFS is conducted by National Statistical Office (NSO).
- It produces annual statistics of employment and unemployment characteristics.
- It also provides quarterly estimates for urban areas.
- **Measurement of Employment Trends**:
    - Measures dynamics in labor force participation.
    - Measures employment status in short intervals (urban areas).
    - Measures labor force estimates on key parameters annually (rural and urban).
    - Parameters include labor force participation rate, worker population ratio.

#### 2. Discuss the key findings of the latest PLFS report on employment and unemployment in India.
- The text mentions the first annual report based on PLFS (July 2017-June 2018) was published in May 2019.
- It does not provide specific key findings from this or any later PLFS report.

#### 3. What is the All-India Quarterly Establishment-based Employment Survey (AQEES), and how does it differ from PLFS?
- **Definition**: AQEES is started by Labour Bureau.
- It provides quarterly updates about employment and related variables of establishments.
- Covers both organized and unorganized segments of nine selected sectors.
- **Components**: Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) for establishments with ≥10 workers, and Area Frame Establishment Survey (AFES) for establishments with ≤9 workers.
- **Differences from PLFS**:
    - **Conducted by**: AQEES by Labour Bureau; PLFS by NSO.
    - **Frequency**: AQEES provides quarterly updates; PLFS provides annual (rural/urban) and quarterly (urban).
    - **Focus**: AQEES is establishment-based (demand side); PLFS is household-based (supply side).
    - **Coverage**: AQEES focuses on nine selected non-farm sectors; PLFS covers all sectors.

#### 4. How do these surveys help in policy-making for labour and employment?
- They provide frequent and comprehensive labor market data.
- PLFS measures labor force participation and employment status.
- AQEES provides employment scenario from the demand side.
- This data is crucial for policy planning.
- It helps identify employment trends, skill gaps, and sectoral needs.
- Enables evidence-based policy interventions for labor and employment.

#### 5. What are the limitations of PLFS and AQEES in accurately capturing employment data?
- The text mentions that Economic Censuses (also establishment-based) have been conducted at irregular intervals and do not cover all types of establishments.
- It does not explicitly list limitations of PLFS and AQEES in accurately capturing employment data.
- However, it implies that AQEES aims to provide more regular and comprehensive data than previous establishment surveys.

### 8.13 Rising Income Inequality
#### 1. What are the key reasons for rising income inequality in India?
- Economic and trade liberalization began in the 1980s.
- People with financial and educational resources grabbed opportunities.
- They multiplied their wealth and income faster than the poor.
- Poor people lacked these resources.
- Simon Kuznets' hypothesis: inequality increases in early economic growth.
- Unequal distribution of human capital (education and health).
- Government spending on subsidies rather than health and education.
- Poor governance and corruption.
- Crony capitalism and election funding.

#### 2. How does rising income inequality affect social and economic development?
- **Social Problems**:
    - Can exacerbate inter-group relations and conflict.
    - Reduces social cohesion.
    - Can lead to increased violent crime and drug usage.
    - Impacts mental health.
- **Economic Development**:
    - Hurts not only the poor but everyone.
    - Can lead to lower overall economic growth in the long run.
    - Reduces aggregate demand if purchasing power is concentrated.
    - Hinders human capital development for a large segment of population.
    - Can make poverty reduction efforts less effective.

#### 3. Discuss the role of progressive taxation in addressing income inequality.
- Progressive taxation means tax percentage increases with income.
- It aims to redistribute wealth from richer to poorer sections.
- The text mentions that some advocate for higher taxes for the rich.
- However, it also states that these may not be pragmatic solutions.
- It suggests raising the tax/GDP ratio with a wider tax base, not just higher rates.
- The new generation wants equality of opportunity, not just redistributive measures.

#### 4. What measures can be taken to reduce the urban-rural divide in income distribution?
- The text mentions that the Kuznets curve implies a rural-urban income gap in early development.
- It suggests that economic growth and inequality converge in India.
- It does not explicitly list measures to reduce the urban-rural divide in income distribution.
- However, it implies that focusing on rural productivity and non-farm occupations could help.

#### 5. How does inequality intersect with caste, gender, and regional disparities in India?
- The text states that "inequalities between the poor and rich have increased further after the reform period."
- It mentions that India is the second most unequal country after Russia.
- It highlights that the average Indian is relatively poor due to highly-skewed income distribution.
- It does not explicitly detail how inequality intersects with caste, gender, and regional disparities.
- However, it implies that these social categories are often excluded from growth benefits.

### 8.14 Poverty Eradication: Public Services or Income Support
#### 1. Discuss the debate between providing public services and direct income support for poverty eradication.
- **Public Services (Universal Basic Services - UBS)**:
    - Focus on eliminating "capability deprivation" (health, education, infrastructure).
    - Services like water, sanitation, housing, health, education are central to capabilities.
    - Cannot always be purchased in the market, so income support alone is insufficient.
    - Essential for people to lead productive and dignified lives.
    - Aims for permanent exit from poverty.
- **Direct Income Support (Universal Basic Income - UBI)**:
    - Transfers cash directly to individuals.
    - Allows recipients to decide how to spend money.
    - Does not distort the market.
    - Can reduce negative impacts on the poor in short run.
    - Critics argue it may reduce work incentive or promote vice.
    - May not be sustainable for already stretched budgets in poor countries.
- The debate is whether to focus on providing basic capabilities or direct cash.

#### 2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of direct cash transfers for poverty alleviation?
##### Advantages
- Increases effectiveness of anti-poverty programs by reducing government departments.
- Reduces costs involved in distribution.
- Removes possibility of leakages and diversion (e.g., DBT in LPG).
- Frees up prices of goods, allowing efficient resource allocation.
- Does not distort the market (unlike price subsidies).
- Can be given to a class of population (PM-KISAN) or entire population (UBI).

##### Disadvantages
- May reduce incentive to work (moral hazard argument).
- May promote spending on "vice" or "temptation goods" (alcohol, tobacco).
- Can impose significant burdens on already stretched government budgets.
- Cannot be a long-term answer for poverty eradication.
- Does not address capability deprivation directly.

#### 3. How do public services like healthcare and education contribute to sustainable poverty eradication?
- Public services address "capability deprivation," which is the root of poverty.
- **Healthcare**: Improves health, enabling individuals to work productively.
- **Education**: Enhances skills and knowledge, increasing employability and income.
- **Physical Infrastructure (water, sanitation, housing)**: Improves living standards and productivity.
- These services enable individuals to earn sufficient income through work or entrepreneurship.
- They are crucial for people to lead productive and dignified lives.
- They contribute to multi-dimensional poverty reduction.
- This approach is considered inherently sustainable for poverty eradication.

#### 4. What is the role of Universal Basic Income (UBI) in addressing poverty?
- UBI is a radical paradigm shift in thinking about social justice and economy.
- It guarantees each individual a minimum income they can count on.
- Provides material foundation for a life with access to basic goods and dignity.
- It is unconditional and universal, paid to all citizens without means test.
- It is a periodic cash payment, allowing recipients to decide spending.
- It is seen as an acknowledgment of the economy as a common project.
- It can reduce poverty by providing a safety net.

####
