## Constitution

**Hen and Eggs Analogy of Laws and Constitutions:**

- - The hen represents the mother law (i.e. The Constitution)
    - Eggs represent laws e.g. Representation of People's Act 1951; Citizenship Act, 1955;  Special Marriage Act, Hindu Code Bill, AFSPA, MGNREGA, etc.
    - The constitution is the first law of the country. Every other law comes after the constitution.
    - Date of birth of the constitution: 26 Nov 1949.
    - As the adopted child’s age can be older than the mother, some laws can be older than the constitution. E.g. Indian Penal Code, 1860, Indian Evidence Act, 1872- These laws were created by the British under their constitution.

**Definition of the Constitution**

- - The Constitution is the **fundamental and** the **organic** law of the nation which establishes the **Conception**, **Character**, and **Organization** of the Governance system of the country.
        - Fundamental: First law of the country and all other laws must conform to the constitution.
        - Organic: Which changes with time. For example, as of now, 104 amendments have been made to the Indian constitution.
        - Conception: It conceives, ideas, foundations,  the existence of Government for India.
        - The character of the govt: Provides for the nature of the Government. For example, the Indian govt is democratic, socialist, secular, republic, etc.
        - Organization: The design of the govt e.g. India follows a parliamentary system, the USA follows the Presidential system, etc.

- - The Constitution of the country determines the extent of the power of the state as well as the manner in which these powers are to be exercised.
    - In short, the constitution is the rule book of the nation.

**Customs vis-a-vis Constitution:**

- - The constitution is the supreme law of the land all the other laws and customs in order to be valid shall have to conform to the constitution.
    - The constitution has **special legal sanctity** since it derives its **powers and authority from the people directly**. Besides being the fundamental law of the country.
    - For example, the preamble of the Indian constitution indicates that the constitution of India is created by the people of India.
    - The Constitution of a country also regulates the **relationship between the government and the people**.

- - **Some examples:**
        - The custom of not allowing women aged 10-50 years in **Sabrimala** was termed unconstitutional. It was termed as against article 17 of the constitution.
        - **Section 377** which declared homosexuality a criminal act was struck down by the Supreme court. The crux of the argument given was that one must not be forced into heterosexual behaviours.

**Basic concepts**

- - **Legislature:** It makes laws; Made at two levels- Centre(Union) and States.
    - **Executive:** Implements the laws made by the Legislature.

**Union Level**

- - Indian Parliament is made up of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. Members of these houses are known as MP(Member of Parliament).
    - Presently there are **543** members after the 104th amendment act of the constitution.
    - Rajya Sabha's strength is 245 and its maximum strength is 250.
        - Out of 245, 12 are nominated and the rest 233 are elected.
        - The nomination of grounds of art, science, literature, and social service.

- - **Purpose of LS elections: 2 purposes.**
        - To elect the legislature.
        - To know which party is securing the majority.
        - PM can be from any house – Lok sabha or Rajya sabha.
        - PM chooses ministers both from Rajya sabha and Lok Sabha – This is known as the Council of Ministers(CoM). 
        - A minister can be from any party if PM wants. 

**State Level**

- - In 6 six states, two houses are there to make the law – Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana.
    - Members of State Legislative Assembly – MLAs
    - Members of State Legislative council – MLC
    - The majority party in the state elections forms the government and the leader of the party is chosen as the Chief Minister.
    - Chief Minister (CM) can be from any house – State Legislative Assembly or State Legislative Council.
    - CM can choose ministers from both houses (if 2 houses are there) – this is known as the Council of Ministers(CoM).
    - CoM implements the laws with the help of bureaucracy.
    - A non-MLA or non-MLC can become a minister but within 6 months he must become an MLA or MLC.
    - MLC are both elected and nominated.

**The making of the Indian Constitution**

- - Under the **Cabinet mission plan**, the body to form the constitution (**constituent assembly**) was formed.
        - Nov 1946, the body was formed.
        - The first meeting of the CA was held on 9th Dec 1946.
    - **Objective resolution(OR)**
        - The philosophy or the theme of the Indian constitution was represented in Objective Resolution which was moved by Pandit Nehru in the **1st session** of the constituent assembly on **13 December 1946.**
        - 13 December 1946: The work of constitution-making started.
        - The OR was moved by Pt. Nehru in the constituent assembly on 13th Dec 1946 and adopted on 22nd Jan 1947.

**The main provisions of OR:**

- - India to be an independent, sovereign, democratic, republic.
    - Indian provinces and other parts of India willing to be part of free and sovereign India shall collectively form a union of India.
    - India to provide freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, worship, vocation, association, and action.
    - India to provide adequate safeguards for minorities and people from backward and tribal areas.
    - India to attain a rightful and honoured place in the world and make a willing contribution in the promotion of world peace and the welfare of mankind.

**Constitutionalism**

- - **Constitutionalism** is a system having a limited government i.e. a **governance setup** whose powers are not unlimited or arbitrary. Thus, it is a system having a limited government.
        - Unlimited government concentrates the power of governance only in few hands and it leads to corruption, exploitation of the common man, and misuse of power.
    - The provisions through which constitutionalism can be achieved are a democratically formed constitution, separation of powers, checks and balances, an independent judiciary, rule of law, etc.
    - Constitutionalism not only places limits on the powers of administration but also on the power/rights of people so that people will not become undisciplined and can create a situation of anarchy or lawlessness.

**Basic differences between the written and unwritten constitution**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Written Constitution**|**Unwritten Constitution**|
|In the Written constitution, the country is governed by both constitutional and other statutory laws. However, the statutory laws should be in accordance with the Constitution.|In the unwritten constitution, the collection of all the virtual laws made by the parliament govern the country.|
|A written constitution is one whose articles and provisions are codified into a **single legal document**.|The provisions of the Unwritten Constitution are not codified into a single legal document.|
|In the Written Constitution, there is a **distinction** between the Constitution and other laws.|While in the Unwritten Constitution, there is no distinction between the Constitution and other laws as each and every enactment of the Parliament is seen as part of the Constitution.|
|In a written constitution, the constitution is supreme and all other organs are supposed to follow the constitution.|In the unwritten constitution, **parliament is supreme,** as every enactment of the parliament/legislature becomes part of the constitution.|
|In the written constitution, the judiciary generally enjoys wide powers through which it can declare an enactment of the parliament or action of the executive as unconstitutional on the grounds of it being violative of provisions of the constitution. (**Judicial review)**|In the unwritten constitution, the judiciary has limited power as in this case judiciary can not declare a law passed by the legislature as unconstitutional.|
|Enacted Constitution as created by a special body in a specified period.|It is an evolved constitution as it was not created by a single body on a fixed date rather it is the outcome of joint efforts of different legislatures over the period of time.|
|It can be rigid or flexible varying from country to country.|It is always flexible because all it takes to amend the unwritten constitution is to pass new legislation.|
|A country with a written constitution can be federal or unitary.|Whereas, the countries with unwritten constitutions are always unitary.|

### Preamble

- - It is customary but not compulsory for a constitution to have a Preamble.
    - Unwritten constitutions do not have Preamble but written constitutions may or may not have Preamble.
    - The Government of India act 1935 did **not** have a preamble.
    - The preamble is regarded as the **prelude or introduction** of the constitution. It is the essence or summary of the whole constitution.
    - It declares the basic values on which the constitution is based.
    - As per **Dr. DD Basu**, it contains the philosophy or the theme of the constitution. 
    - Nanabhoy Palkiwala called preamble as '**Identity card of the constitution**'
    - It contains the key to unravel the minds of the constitution-makers and tell us the intention that these people have while forming various provisions of the constitution.

- - Many experts believed that preamble is an ornamental part or decorative part of the constitution due to various reasons.
        - It is not enforceable in a court of law.
        - Preamble is in the form of a declaration and it does not confer any substantive powers on the organs of the government nor it can limit those powers.
        - Preamble can not overwrite the specific provisions of the constitution. i.e., the preamble is subordinate to the constitution, and if there is a clash between an article of the constitution and the preamble, then the constitution shall prevail over the preamble.
    - **But, as per the SC,** the preamble can be used to remove the ambiguity surrounding any specific provisions of the Indian constitution, and then the court will come up with the interpretation of the article of the constitution, which matches with the preamble.
        - Thus, the preamble can be used in legal interpretation, understanding of various provisions of the constitution.
    - The preamble declares that the source of all the powers of the constitution **is the people themselves** and the constitution arises from the people only. i.e.. in India, **people are ultimate sovereign.**
        - In the **Kehar Singh Vs UOI case 1989**, this statement was challenged that the constitution derives its powers from the people directly.
            - The supreme court said that the statement, "constitution of India derives its powers from people directly is a legal fiction, but a conclusive assumption which can not be challenged or tested in the court of law."
    - The preamble also contains the enacting clause, where it declares when the constitution of India was enacted and adopted, i.e. on **26th Nov 1949**.
    - It contains the **ideals and the aspiration** of the people of India.
        - 5 Ideals : Sovereignty, socialist, secular, democracy, republic
        - 4 aspirations: Liberty, Justice, Equality, and Fraternity.

**Debate : is preamble part of constitution?**

- - The **traditional view** was that Preamble was not part of the constitution because even if it is to be dropped, the constitution would continue to function.
    - Further, unlike the Constitution, Preamble does not confer any power on the organs of the state, nor it limits those powers, and therefore, Preamble has a limited role to play in the constitution.
    - Supreme Court in the **Re-Berubary case, 1960** held that Preamble was **not part of the Constitution**.

- - However, the **modern view** is that **Preamble is part of the Constitution**, because only if Preamble is a part of the Constitution, then only it can be amended suitably to keep it updated with a modern-day Constitution and its philosophy.
    - Therefore, the Supreme Court in the **Keshavananda Bharati v/s State of Kerala case, 1973,** held that Preamble is a part of the Constitution.

**How many times the Preamble was amended?**

- - The same was amended once through the 42nd Constitutional amendment act, 1976.
    - Addition of 3 words: Secular, socialist, integrity.

**The Ideals mentioned in the Preamble**

**Sovereignty**

- - Sovereignty means that the country's government is totally independent and it does not acknowledge any arbitrary power as supreme w.r.t. the governance of the country, either within its boundary or internationally.

- - The **examples and arguments** were provided for both sides.
        - In the era of LPG (Liberalisation, Privatisation, and Globalisation), it is argued that none of the countries is completely sovereign including India, since the countries are part of the number of international organizations like UN, EU, etc. and various treaties put restraints or pressurize on the decision-making process/capacity of the country, and thus they lose their sovereignty.
        - However, in the case of India, this argument is not completely true since, when India takes its decisions keeping in mind the interests of India and Indians which is the demand of diplomacy and not the loss of sovereignty.
        - Also, in the larger interest of India, if India has to put its foot down, then India does it irrespective of the pressure and India does assert for the national interest.
            - E.g. : S-400 deal, etc.

**Secularism**

- - Secularism means that the state does not acknowledge any religion as its official religion i.e.. the country is not affiliated with only one specific religion.
    - In the case of India, the way secularism is practiced indicates that the state is **neither religious nor irreligious nor anti-religious**. Rather, India is non-religious in character. (agnostic)
    - Western countries are also secular including France, as they also do not have any specific religion as their official religion. However, in the case of western secularism, the state has distanced itself from all the religion equally and the state does not promote any religion actively.
    - The administrative decisions are also not inspired by any religious activity of any religion.
    - However, the Indian state is equally close and appreciative of all religions equally. Indian state accommodates the sentiments and aspirations of all the religions equally. This way all the religions which have made Indian their home get a chance to flourish and grow.
    - Indian style of secularism promotes a sense of security among all the religions which brings harmony to the society.

**Democracy**

- - Democracy is a political system based on the idea of the rule of people.
    - It can be direct or indirect democracy.
    - Whether it is a direct or representative democracy, it is very essential that before decisions are made, everybody must be heard and people are involved in the decision-making process.
    - In India, direct democracy is not possible for the reason that India has a huge population and high illiteracy level, and taking these decisions may not be easy. So, on the behalf of the people, their representative takes the decision.
    - However, if people's representatives do not interact with the people whom they represent, then the same weakens the democracy.
    - Paid media is a big threat to democracy.
    - People not coming to vote or voting for unworthy representatives like criminals also weakens democracy.
    - To strengthen democracy:
        - ECI by conducting elections in a free and fair manner.
        - Independent media and judiciary can also strengthen democracy.
        - A strong civil society, things like NOTA, etc. strengthen democracy.

- - People’s representatives, i.e.., legislators if change their political parties for personal benefits (**political defection),** this can weaken democracy.
        - Anti-defection law is present to prevent legislatures from carrying out political defections.
    - Misuse of law specifically the ones like National Security Act, Sedition law, preventive detention laws to suppress the genuine expressions made by the citizens also weaken democracy.

**Socialism**

- - A political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.
    - Socialism creates a scenario where all the members of the society are getting benefitted by the resources of the society & no member is left out.
    - Unlike Marxist socialism which believed in complete nationalization followed in USSR, India believed in **Democratic socialism** or Fabian Socialism.
    - Here private ownership & private enterprise was allowed;
    - But there was some rule which ensures no member of the society concentrates the wealth & nobody is left out from enjoying the resources of the society.
    - This type of socialism was based on the concept of mixed economy, progressive taxation, land ceiling, Govt run welfare schemes, etc.
    - Two important socialistic goals which are mentioned in the Indian Constitution are - Art. 39(b), Art39(c)
        - **Art. 39(b)** --> Says to the state that material resources of the society shall be so distributed so as to serve the common interest of the society;
        - **Art39(c)** -->State must prevent concentration of wealth in fewer hands;
    - **Issues with socialism in India:**
        - The rising level of inequality;
        - High Poverty & Hunger;
        - Level of malnourishment among under 5 year old children;

**Republic**

- - A political system where people are supreme & there is no hereditary ruler;
    - Even the head of the state is elected by people only for a fixed term;

**Justice**

- - The preamble of the Indian constitution mentions political social & economic justice
        - i.e. the Indian constitution promises a comprehensive form of justice
        - Here **political justice** supported by universal adult suffrage under **Art. 326**
        - **Social justice** promised under various provisions of **Part 3**(Fundamental Rights),
            - E.g. : Right to Equality, Right against discrimination, Right against untouchability;
        - **Economic Justice** supported by provisions like FR to vocation(or occupation), and DPSP.

**Liberty**

- - Absence of arbitrary powers exerted by one individual or group over another individual or group.
    - This ensures that everyone gets an opportunity to grow and achieve his potential

**Equality**

- - Preamble talks about equality of status & equality of opportunity;

**Fraternity**

- - It is a feeling of brotherhood among the people of India & is very essential to promote unity & integrity of India;

### Part 1 : UNION AND ITS TERRITORIES

**Article 1**

- - India is a union of states. The name of the country is India i.e. Bharat.
    - The term union of states is less wide than the term territory of India.

        - India is not the result of the agreement between the state.

    - Then on the recommendation of the president, the bill is introduced and requires a simple majority in parliament as per Article 4.

**State Reorganization**

**Advantages of New smaller states**

- - It leads to better administration.
    - This will also provide tailor-made solutions to a diversity of problems.
    - It caters to the aspiration of neglected masses and promotes national integration through concretizing democracy.

**Cons**

- - The creation of smaller gives rise to regionalism and similar demands come up from other regions.
    - It may lead to interstate water disputes.

        - 50% of 543 is **271.5**
            - It is used in the formation of government - Any party that has got a minimum of 272 members, forms the government.

**3 kinds of Right:**

- - **Given by ordinary laws of the legislature:**
        - Rights which are given by ordinary laws of the legislature are called ‘**Ordinary Legal Rights’**
        - **Examples:**
            - Right to have a driving license given by: Motor vehicle act
            - Maternity relief act
            - MNREGA gives the right to have a minimum of 100 days of unskilled work
            - To make any changes in these laws requires laws brought by a **simple majority**
    - **Rights given by Constitution are called constitutional rights**
        - However Indian constitution is divided into various parts
        - Rights given in ‘**Part III’** are called **‘Fundamental right’**
        - Rights that are in the constitution but ‘**outside part III’** are called **‘Constitutional Rights’**
        - **For instance,** 
            - Article 300A in part XII
            - Article 301 in Part XIII
            - Article 326 part XV
    - **Note:** All fundamental rights are constitutional rights but not all constitutional rights are a fundamental right
    - The last two sets of rights (FR and constitutional rights) are not easy to amend, they need the procedure to be followed under **special majority under article 368**
    - **Note:** But the difference is, of **justification or reason so compelling** which is needed to be given by legislature for bringing any change in Fundamental rights

### Fundamental Duties

- - **Part IV - A** of the Indian constitution was added by the **42nd Amendment act** inspired by the constitution of the USSR. 
        - **Article 51 A** discusses the 11 fundamental duties of every Indian citizen. 
            - **Article 51A (a)** is a Fundamental duty to abide by the constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, National Flag, and National anthem.
            - **Article 51 A (b)** to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired the national struggle for freedom. 
            - **Article 51 A (c)** to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India
            - **Article 51A(d)** To defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so.
                - E.g.: to be ready to serve the country in case of war.
            - **Article 51A(e)**To promote harmony and spirit of common brotherhood, renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of the women. 
            - **Article 51A(f)** To value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture of India.
            - **Article 51 A(g)** To protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures.
            - **Article 51A(h)**To develop scientific temper and humanism, and the spirit of inquiry and reform.
            - **Article 51A(i)** To safeguard public property and abjure violence.
            - **Article 51A(J)**To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement.
            - **Article 51A(k)**Introduced by the 86th amendment act, under which it is an FD for all the parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.

- - The Constitution of India does not carry the provision for direct enforcement of these duties that is there is no sanction to prevent their violation however Parliament can enforce them through suitable legislation. 
    - The SC clarified that FDs can act as a reference to understanding the limits of Fundamental Rights. 
    - FDs are non-justiciable. However, the purpose of their inclusion in the constitution was to bring awareness among the citizens regarding their role in strengthening democracy.
    - However, just a mention of the duties in the constitution will not serve the purpose, rather opinion building through active media and civil society is a must besides changing the value system which puts the nation first over the Individual or the family.
    - The SC clarified that FDs not only put a limit on the actions of the citizens but on the state as well.

|---|---|
|**PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT**|**PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT**|
|- - - The executive is part of the Legislature<br>        - Ministers are from Parliament only and if not, they need to acquire the membership of Parliament within a reasonable time which is 6 months.<br>        - The real powers are with the Council of ministers which is responsible for the popular house.<br>            - i.e.. CoM is headed by PM is in the office enjoys the confidence of Lok Sabha.<br>            - President is only a nominal head.<br>        - Puts greater stress on the idea of the **accountability** of the Executive<br>            - i.e. Executive is more accountable/ responsible even if less stable.|- - - There is a clear differentiation of power between the Executive and Legislature.<br>        - President chooses his/her team of ministers from amongst the citizens at large and they are not members of Parliament.<br>        - President has the real Executive powers and he is playing both the roles of being Head of State and Head of the Government.<br>        - Puts greater stress on the idea of **stability** of the Executive even if it is less accountable.|

### PART III: Fundamental Right (FR)

- - FRs of the Indian constitution is inspired by **the Bill of Rights** in the American constitution
    - Rights under part III of the constitution are called FRs not only because these rights are provided by the fundamental law of the country but because these rights are the most indispensable assets for an individual to achieve his fullest physical, intellectual and spiritual potential
    - These rights prevent states from becoming arbitrary or authoritarian and thus these rights are Fundamental for a civilized society
    - These are also fundamental because the state can’t take away these rights
    - Any law which infringes them can be declared null and void
    - FRs are very essential for the healthy functioning of democracy and thus FRs are called as the **cornerstone of Indian democracy**

- - Part 3 and 4 together constitute the conscience or intellectual component of the constitution

- - **Difference between FRs and other/ordinary legal right:**
        - The difference between the two lies between enforceability between the two that is:
            - Ordinary legal right is protected and enforced by ordinary law of the land whereas an FR is protected and guaranteed by the constitution itself
        - Ordinary rights can be amended by the legislature through an ordinary process of law-making however FRs can be changed only by amending the constitution itself
        - In case of violation of FRs one can directly approach the SC directly and get the concern addressed however in case of violation of ordinary right the aggrieved can approach a subordinate court or high court but not directly to SC
        - FRs primarily protects an individual against the actions of the state however a few FRs are available against the state as well as private individuals
            - **For example:**
                - Right against untouchability, right against exploitation, right to life
        - FRs are not absolute since they are subjected to reasonable restrictions and responsibilities attached to them provided these restrictions should not be arbitrary
        - FRs can be of nature of **negative injunction or positive commandments**
        - **FRs in nature of negative injunctions** are negatively worded rights that prohibit the state from taking certain actions
            - For example:
                - Article 14
                - Article 16(2)
        - **FRs in nature of positive commandments** are positively worded FRs conferring certain benefits upon individuals
            - For example:
                - Right under Article 19 or Article 25

- - **The doctrine of Eclipse:**
        - According to **Article 13(1)**, all the ‘LAWS’ enforced in India immediately before the commencement of the constitution shall be unconstitutional and void if they violate one or more provisions of part III of the Indian constitution **to the extent of such violation**
        - **In Bhika Ji Narayan v/s state of Madhya Pradesh case 1955:**
            - SC applied the principle of the eclipse and held that a pre-constitutional law that is infringing upon FR can be given the protection that is the law may be made dormant but not dead and can be revived in the future if any amendment is able to remove the clash between the law and the FR
            - Thus, the law can be brought under the shadow of FRs and it will remain in the shadow and it will not be enforced till the time conflict is there
        - **SC in Deepchand v/s State of UP case 1959:**
            - Held that doctrine of the eclipse can be applied only to pre-constitutional law and not post-constitutional law since post-constitutional law which is violating the FRs is unconstitutional **‘ab Initio'**
    - **Article 13(2)**
        - Says that State shall not make any law that takes away or abridges one or more FRs and if any such law is passed by legislature then the law shall be unconstitutional and void to the extent of its inconsistency with FR

**The debate around Amend ability of Fundamental Rights**

- - Seemingly against the spirit of Article 13(2), the **First Amendment Act 1951** amended **Part 3** of the constitution and **introduced article 15(4)** which appears to be going against article 15(1).
    - The 1st Amendment Act also amended **Article 19(6)** through which reasonable restrictions were put on the right to occupation/vocation.
    - It also introduced the **ninth schedule in** the Constitution which took away the power of judicial review with respect to the laws added in the ninth schedule, on the ground of the laws was violative of FR's.
        - However, In IR Coelho case, Supreme court held that JR is part of 'basic structure' of the constitution. Laws under 9th Schedule will fall under JR if they are in violation of fundamental right

- - In Shankari Prasad vs UOI case 1951, **the 1st Constitutional Amendment Act** was challenged before the Supreme on the ground that it was violative of **Art 13(2).**
        - **Shankari Prasad vs UOI case 1951**
            - The judgment came in the favour of Parliament. 
            - The ruling said that **Parliament enjoys 2 types of legislative powers**:
                - Ordinary legislative power.
                - Constitutional legislative power under article 368.

If parliament makes use of its constitutional legislative powers under article 368, then the outcome is the **constitutional amendment act.**

The same is not covered in the definition of LAW as provided under Article 13(3).

Thus, it will not fall under the scope of Article 13(2) or is not a violation of Article 13(2).

मतलब Constitutional Amendment is not a law.

- - - - - However, if parliament makes use of its ordinary legislative power, then the outcome will be called LAW, which will come under the scope of Article 13(2) and would be void if it goes against one or more FR's.
        - Thus, the SC in the Shankari Prasad case held that the **parliament under article 368 can amend any part** of the constitution including the FR's.

- - **Golak Nath Vs State of Punjab 1967**
        - In this case, SC overruled its earlier decision and held that Article 368 contains only the **procedure** to amend the Constitution but it does not confer the Parliament with the **power** to amend the constitution.
        - Thus, under article 368, parliament can not amend any part of the constitution including FR's.
        - However, Parliament responded by passing the **24th Amendment Act 1971.**
        - The title of article 368 amended, which now read as **"The Power and Procedure to Amend the Constitution"**.

- - In the **Keshavananda Bharti vs State of Kerala case 1973**, the 24th AA, among other things, was challenged before the SC.
        - **Keshavananda Bharti Vs State of Kerala Case 1973**
            - The SC upheld the Constitutional validity of the 24th AA.
            - It declared that the Parliament by the **virtue of its powers under Article 368** can amend any part of the Constitution under Art 368, including the FR's.
            - However, **no amendment should disturb the "Basic Structure"** of the Indian Constitution.
                - The SC did not define, what the basic structure of the constitution is. However, in a number of cases, the court has explained or mentioned the provisions of the Indian constitution which together make the basic structure of the Indian constitution.
                - The basic structure includes those parts of the constitution without which the constitution may lose its basic character.
                - Following are the examples of the aspects/components of the basic structure:

The sovereignty of India, Power of judicial review, separation of power, the mandate to build a welfare state, secularism, socialism, the supremacy of the constitution, access to justice, etc.

**Categorization of Fundamental Rights**

- - Right to Equality: Article 14-18
    - Right to Freedom: Article 19-22
    - Right Against Exploitation: Article 23-24
    - Right to Freedom of Religion: Article 25-28
    - Cultural and Educational Rights: Article 29-30
    - Right to constitutional remedy: Article 32.

**Right to Equality**

- - **Article 14**
        - Art 14 says that the State shall not deny to any person - Equality before Law or Equal Protection of Law.

**Equality Before Law**

- - This concept originated in England.
    - It's a **negatively worded concept** which means the absence of privileges enjoyed by an individual in the eyes of Law.
    - This means all persons, irrespective of their rank and position, are equal before Law and they shall be treated equally. 
    - However, there are a few exceptions to equality before the law.
        - For example, the President of India, or Governor of a state is not answerable to any court.
            - No criminal proceedings can be initiated or continued against President or Governor.
            - No civil proceedings in which relief is claimed can be instituted/started against the President or governor except before serving a 2 months notice.
            - Privileges of Parliament, etc. related aspects.

**Equal protection of the law**

- - The concept originated in the USA.
    - It is a **positively worded** concept that means equality of treatment in equal circumstances i.e., like should be treated as alike.
    - It does not mean the uniform application of the law under all circumstances.
    - Rather, it takes into account situational variations must be taken into consideration before applying the law.
    - **Thus, article 14 guarantees 'Equality only among the Equals.'**
    - Equal Protection of Law provides for a form of discrimination which is called **Protective/Positive discrimination** under which the reservation policy is valid.

**Rule of Law**

- - The concept of England has been incorporated under the idea of the right to equality.
        - i.e. for rule of law, equality before the law is a must.
        - Rule of Law means that the Law is Supreme i.e. **" Lex Supremus",** and there is absolute supremacy of Law of the Country as opposed to the influence of any arbitrary power.
        - It is the adoption of the Rule of Law, which has changed the idea of administration from **"Rex Lex" (King is the Law) to "Lex Rex"(Law is the King)**.
        - Today the law is king and the king is not the law.
            - Example: CCI put a fine on Reliance for delaying the gas extraction from KG Basin.
            - This is very much essential to maintain order in society.
    - **Principles of Rule of Law**
        - No man/woman can be punished or made to suffer except for violation of Law and such a violation shall also be established in the ordinary court of Land.
        - All persons are subject to ordinary law of the Land without any distinction.
            - i.e.. all can sue and can get sued before the court.
        - The third principle of rule of law as applied in India is a modification of the 3rd principle of the rule of law as applicable in England because, in England, every action of the legislature is supreme.
        - In India, the Constitution is the supreme law and all the laws passed by the legislature must be consistent with the provisions of the Indian Constitution.

- - **Article 15 (Right against discrimination)**
        - **Article 15(1) :**
            - The state shall not discriminate against citizens only on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them.
            - These conditions alone are not sufficient grounds to have discrimination done under Equal protection of Law but these conditions must be accompanied by some other circumstances to carry out the discrimination.
            - For example, aspects related to biological differences.
        - **Article 15(2) :**
            - Prohibits state and individual both from discriminating against citizens only on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them, in having access to public places like parks, hotels, entertainment hubs, or well, tank, ghats, roads maintained of state's fund.
            - This article fights several types of social evils like untouchability, communalism, racial discrimination, etc.
        - **Article 15(3):**
            - It states that the state can make special provisions for the welfare of women and children.
        - **Article 15(4):**
            - The article was introduced by First Amendment Act, 1951.
            - It empowers the state to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or SCs and STs.
        - **Article 15(5):**
            - The article was introduced by 93rd Amendment Act, 2005.
            - It empowers the state to make special provisions for the admission of backward classes of citizens in educational institutions whether public or private including aided and unaided private educational institutions except for minority educational institutions.
        - **Article 15(6):**
            - The article was introduced by 103rd Amendment Act, 2019.
            - It provided for reservation up to 10% for economically weaker sections(EWS) in educational institutions whether public or private including aided and unaided educational institutions except in minority educational institutions.

- - **Article-16: Equality of Opportunity in Matters of Public Employment**
        - **Article 16(1)**
            - Provides for equality of opportunity for all sections of citizens in the matters of public employment
        - **Article 16(2)**
            - Prohibits the State from discriminating against citizens in matters of public employment only on the **ground of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, residence, descent**, or any of them is having access to public employment 
        - **Article 16(3)**
            - **Parliament** is empowered to provide by Law, **"Residence"** as a ground or qualification to gain certain categories of Public Employment under the state. 
        - **Article 16(4)**
            - This empowers the State to make special provisions in the favour of backward classes of citizens in reserving the posts of the nature of public employment if the backward class is not adequately represented under the State and the said class of citizens is socially and educationally backward.
            - This **does not mean t**hat the people from the above communities have the **right to the reservation**, rather it is the prerogative of the Government to provide reservation

**Evolution of Reservation in India**

- - **Indira Sawhney Vs Union of India Case-1992 also known as Mandal case** 
        - SC in Indira Sawhney Vs Union of India Case-1992 clarified the legal position reservation policy 
        - The court held that the **27% reservation for OBCs** in public jobs was constitutionally valid 
        - However, the SC directed the State to identify the **creamy layer** among the OBCs and remove them from the benefit of reservations.
        - The Court held that ordinarily, reservation in the favour of backward classes **shall not exceed 50%** of the total seats.
        - The SC also held that reservation should be a one-time benefit that can be availed at the entry-level only.
        - Thus the SC declared that the reservation given to SC/STs in the promotion be unconstitutional and void.
        - However, Parliament responded by adding Article 16(4A) through 77th Amendment Act-1995 which provided for reservation in promotion to SCs/STs.
    - **Article 16(5)**
        - Empowers the State to prescribe religion as a ground or qualification of recruitment of candidates in certain categories of public employment.
    - **Article 16(6): 103rd Amendment Act**
        - Empowers the State to reserve 10% of total seats for economically weaker sections in public employment.

- - **Article 17: Abolition of Untouchability**
        - Article 17 provides a fundamental right against untouchability in absolute form without any limitation or exception
        - Neither the constitution nor Parliamentary law defines untouchability.
        - Rather the judiciary has defined it as a social practice where a person only on the basis of his birth is looked down upon and discriminated against wrongly
        - The SC expanded the definition by declaring that any practice in which an individual or a group is considered polluted or impure and discriminated against would also amount to the practice of untouchability
        - Untouchability Offences Act-1955, which prescribed for the punishment for practicing untouchability has been renamed and strengthened as Civil Rights Protection Act-1976.

- - **ARTICLE 18: Abolition of Titles**
        - **Article 18(1)**
            - Prohibits the State from conferring any titles except for military or academic distinction.
            - National awards, also called Padma Awards started in 1954 are regarded as decorations or awards and not titles.
                - And therefore the awardee is not supposed to use them as a prefix or suffix with their name.
        - **Article 18(2)**
            - Prohibits the citizens of India from accepting any title from a foreign State.
        - **Article 18(3)**
            - A foreigner holding any office of profit or trust under the Indian State can not accept any Title from a foreign State without the consent of the President.

**Right to Freedom**

- - **Article 19**
        - It provides the right to six freedoms. It confers six democratic rights on every citizen which are essential for the healthy functioning of democracy.
        - **Article 19 (1) (a):** It provides for the freedom of speech and expression. It guarantees to all citizens a right to speech and expression.
            - After Article 21, the right to speech and expression has undergone the most liberal interpretation at the hands of the Supreme Court. Court also held that the freedom of speech and expression is an **inalienable adjunct** (extension) of the right to life.
            - Supreme Court explained that freedom of speech and expression can come in various forms. For example, national flag hoisting is also a way to express one’s feelings towards the country and thus is allowed under Article 19 (1) (a).
            - Supreme Court also explained that **participating in sports** is also a way to express oneself. And therefore participating in sports is a derived fundamental right under Article 19 (1) (a).
            - The court explained that the right of a citizen to express the views and opinions of others is also part of the freedom under **Article 19 (1) (a).** This gives origin to the **freedom of the press**.
            - Freedom of Speech & Expression also includes the **right to political dissent** i.e. the right to disagree from the views of the government. This gives rise to the right to multiparty democracy.
            - Freedom of speech and expression also includes the right to have access to information as a fundamental right and RTI Act tells how we can access this information as our fundamental right.
            - The Freedom of Speech & Expression is not limited by the boundaries of the country and the citizens enjoy them even while traveling abroad.

**Restriction**

- - Freedom of speech and expression is not an absolute right, rather it is a restricted right that can be restricted on the grounds of the security and sovereignty of India maintaining friendly relations with other countries, public order, morality, etc.

- - **Article 19 (1) (b)**
        - It provides Fundamental Right to assemble. It includes a peaceful assembly to protest or carrying out a procession.
    - **Article 19 (1) (c)**
        - It guarantees the right to form an association. It includes the right to form the political association and the right to form trade unions as well as the right to form cooperative societies which were added by the 97th Amendment Act 2011.
        - The right to form a trade union does not mean having the fundamental Right to strike. The right to strike may be a legal right but it is not a fundamental right.
        - SC declared in 1998 under the **Bharat Kumar case that Bandh was illegal**.
            - Reason: It involves an element of the force as well as disturbs public order and business.

**Restriction**

- - **Article 33** of the Indian Constitution empowers the Parliament to impose restrictions on a fundamental right available to the armed forces using this provision Parliament has passed a number of laws under which armed forces have been denied the fundamental right to form political associations in the interest of the security of India.

- - **Article 19 (1) (d)**
        - It guarantees to every citizen a right to move freely throughout the territory of India. That is no part of India shall be made inaccessible to the citizens.
        - However, their right can be **restricted** on the ground of security of India, public order, the interest of tribal, health, etc.

- - **Article 19 (1) €**
        - Freedom of residence and settlement throughout India. However, it is also restricted on the same ground as given above.
    - **Article 19 (1) (f)**
        - It was provided for the right to property but now removed from the list of Fundamental Right and made non Fundamental Right under Article 300A as per the 44th Amendment Act.
    - **Article 19 (1) (g)**
        - It guarantees every Indian citizen right to vocation i.e. profession or a trade or occupation of one’s choice.
        - However, the state can impose restrictions on it in the form of qualifications in certain professions, in the public interest, the state can even take over a business or a trade partially or completely provided it is in the public interest.

- - **Article 20**
        - It provides three types of protection to an individual against the coercive powers of the state i.e. protection with respect to conviction for the offenses.
        - **Article 20(1)**:
            - It prohibits the state from enacting **Ex-Post-Facto criminal legislation.**
                - Ex-post facto legislation means enacting a law and giving it a retrospective effect.
                - Under Article 20(1) no man/woman shall be convicted and sentenced for an act that was not a criminal act at the time of its commissioning.
        - **Article 20(2):**
            - The state is prohibited from practicing Double Jeopardy.
            - This means no person shall be punished more than once in a court of law for commissioning a single offense.
        - **Article 20 (3):**
            - Prohibits the state from compelling an individual to provide self-incriminating evidence.
                - Example of Narco test case, A.K Telgi.

- - **Article 21: Right to life**
        - No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.
        - As per the Supreme Court of India, Article 21 does not merely guarantee a right to life rather it guarantees a **right to a dignified life.**
        - As per the Supreme Court of India, Article 21 is not a single right rather it is a composite right and has given rise to the largest number of inferred or derived Fundamental Rights.
            - For example, the Right to life includes, right to primary education, the right to a corruption-free environment, the right against cruel punishment, the right to a clean environment, the right to health of the workers, the right to privacy, the right to marry, right to the internet, right to reputation, etc.
        - Article 21 emerged as the most evolved article under the constitution of India.
            - According to Supreme Court, all other Fundamental Rights revolve around Article 21, and without the right to life enjoyed by an individual, all other Fundamental Rights will become meaningless.
        - Thus, article 21 has emerged as fundamental of all the fundamental rights.
        - It can also be seen that all the FRs, and DPSPs ultimately aimed to achieve a quality life which is promised under article 21.
        - Thus article 21 is regarded as the backbone of part 3 and part 4 of the Indian constitution.
        - Right to life under article 21, brings out the difference between a police state and a constitutional state.

**Procedure Established by the Law (PEBL)**

- - The concept **originated in England** and under this doctrine when a person is deprived of his life or liberty then the court will examine the three things which are as follows:
        - Is there any law in existence that authorizes the authorities/executive to deprive the individual of his life or liberty?
        - The court will also examine whether the law was made by competent authority/legislature?
        - Were all the procedures correctly followed while enacting the law?
        - The court however will **not examine the fairness of the law** or the motive of the lawmakers behind the law. Thus under the PEBL, the court cannot declare the law as unconstitutional or void.
    - The doctrine of PEBL relies more on the good sense of the legislature and the strength of public opinion in the country.
    - Thus, the Doctrine of the PEBL extends protection to an individual only against the arbitrary action of the executive but not that of the legislature.

**Due process of law**

- - Under this doctrine, the courts while examining the law will not only look at the law from the point of view of the competence of the legislature that passes the law and also that whether the legislature followed the proper procedures while enacting the law.
    - The court will also subject the law to check **whether the law is fair or not.**
    - Thus, due process of law provides protection to an individual against the arbitrary action of the executive as well as legislature.
    - Indian Constitution, under Article 21, has provided only for Procedure Established by Law(PEBL).
    - However, the Supreme Court of India in the **Maneka Gandhi case in,1978** interpreted Article 21 to include the Doctrine of Due Process of Law(DPL) under Article-21.

**The Principle of Natural Justice**

- - **This is a set of 3 principles:**
        - No man shall be punished unheard.
        - Nobody can be the judge of his own case.
        - The authorities must act bonafide.
    - The purpose of these principles that every action or decision must be supported by a justified reason.
    - These principles ensure that the absence of arbitrariness in action.
    - According to the Supreme Court, these principles are universal in nature i.e., they are binding upon all the authorities.
    - The SC declared that these principles have **not been explicitly incorporated in the Indian Constitution.**
        - However, Supreme Court clarified that these principles are **inherent in the Indian Constitution** and can be found related to article 14 and article 21.
        - The court held that these principles are so important for the orderly functioning of society that they are regarded as part of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution.

- - **Article 21A: 86th Amendmen**t
        - **Article 21-A** Was introduced by the **86th amendment 2002** under which the State shall provide **free and compulsory education** to all children age **six to fourteen as provided by Law.**
            - Free education can be forced upon the state, whereas compulsory education is the responsibility of parents as well as the state therefore 86 the Amendment act also introduced a Fundamental duty under article 51-A(K) under which it is the duty of every citizen who is a parent or guardian to provide the opportunity of education to the child aged 6-14 years
    - **Article 22:**  **Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases.**
        - Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases but article 22 does not guarantee against arrest or detention 
        - Article 22 comes into play after the arrest of the person, not before that 
        - Article 22 confers 3 rights on a person who is arrested or detained 
            - No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without informing him of the ground of his arrest and he shall be entitled to consult an attorney of his choice SC declared that the arrested person has a right to have his friends relatives or some other known person informed about his arrest 
            - The arrested person shall be produced before the nearest Judicial Magistrate within 24 hours of arrest, no person shall be detained beyond the period for which his detention was authorized by the Magistrate 
            - The protections under article 22 may not be made available to the persons detained under preventive detention law and enemy aliens

**Right against exploitation** 

- - **ARTICLE 23: Right against exploitation** 
        - **Article 23(1)**
            - Prohibits traffic in human beings, begar, and every other forced labour.
            - Begar: Work without pay;
            - Forced Labour: To be forced to work against one's will.
        - **Article 23(2)**
            - Empowers the State to compel the individual to provide service with or without payment, provided it is in public interest.
    - **ARTICLE 24: Prohibition of Employment of Children**
        - Children aged less than 14 years are prohibited from being employed in hazardous employment.
        - Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act-1986:
            - Now, by the Amendment to the Act in 2016, a **child less than 14 years** of age would not be allowed to work anywhere, including the hazardous occupations.

**Right to Freedom of Religion**

- - **Article 25: Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice, and Propagation of Religion.**
        - Guarantees to all individuals twofold freedom of religion which includes-
        - **Right to freedom of conscience**
            - Absolute inner freedom of an individual to mould his religious belief and faith 
            - When inner freedom takes an outward expression then it is right to profess practice or propagate a religion of one's choice 
        - **Right to profess**
            - Right to profess means the right of an individual to spell out his religious belief freely and openly 
        - **Right to practice** 
            - The right to practice means the right of an individual to follow the rituals prescribed by one's religion
            - This includes the right to display symbols and sign associated with one religion for example Kirpan, Burka
        - **Right to Propagate**
            - This means the right to spell out one's religious teachings for the edification of others. 
            - SC in **Father Stanislaus vs the State of MP-1977** 
                - The SC clarified that the FR of a person to transmit or spread by explaining the content can not be questioned.
                - However, there is no FR to convert others to one's own religion.
                - Recently SC has also clarified that the Right to faith and belief enjoyed by the individual is absolute and the state can not interfere in it in any manner but in the case of religious conduct and practice the state is free to regulate it in the larger interest of society 

- - **Article 26: Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs**
        - Freedom of religious denomination to manage their religious affairs subject to Public Order, Morality, and Health.
        - Art 26 also allows every religious denomination to have the right to own and it also allows them to establish and maintain institutions for religious charitable purposes.

- - **Article 27**
        - It truly brings out the secular character of the Indian state.
        - Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion.
        - Article 27 prohibits the state from spending tax collections for the promotion and maintenance of any particular religious denomination.
        - However, Article 27 **does not prohibit the state** from spending the tax collections for the promotion and maintenance **of all religions without any discrimination.**
        - Similarly, Article 27 does not prohibit the state from spending non-tax collections, collected in the form of a **fee or donation** in spending for the promotion and maintenance even of a particular religion.

- - **Article 28**
        - It deals with giving/imparting instructions that are religious in nature in educational institutions.
        - **It divided all the educational institutions into 4 categories.**
            - Educational institutions, which are completely owned and administered by the state.
                - no religious instructions whatsoever can be imparted.
            - Educational Institutions, which are privately owned and managed but aided by the state.
                - religious instructions can be imparted, but students cannot be compelled to attend them.
            - Educational institutions, which are privately owned and managed but are unaided by the state.
                - religious instructions can be imparted, but students cannot be compelled to attend them.
            - Educational institutions, which are administered by the state but are founded through religious endowment or charitable trust.
                - religious instructions can be imparted and can be made compulsory for the students to attend them.

**Cultural and educational rights**

- - **Article 29**
        - It deals with the protection of the interest of minorities.
        - **Article 29(1):** 
            - Any section of an Indian citizen residing in India, having a distinct language, script, or culture shall have the right to conserve the same.
            - Though the title of article 29 is the protection of the interests of the minorities, however, the language of Article 29(1) extends this right to all the sections of citizens who are residing in India.
        - **Article 29(2):**
            - No citizen shall be denied admission in educational institutions only on the grounds of religion, race, caste, language, or any of them.
            - **Note: 'Sex**' is not mentioned in the article and hence admission can be denied only on the ground of sex as in Girl's schools, Boys school, etc.
    - **Article 30**
        - Deals with the right of minority communities to establish and administer educational institutions in their own way.
        - It classifies the minorities on the basis of religion and language.

**Right to constitutional remedies**

- - **Article 32**
        - It provides for Rights to Constitutional remedies.
        - It confers the power, on Supreme Court (SC) to issue appropriate orders, directions, or writs to enforce fundamental rights if found violated.
        - It allows the individual to directly approach the Supreme Court in case of violation of fundamental rights.
        - Thus Article 32 contains the legal remedy in case the fundamental rights of an individual are violated.
        - It is Article 32 that makes all other fundamental rights real and enforceable i.e., Article provides teeth to all other fundamental rights.
            - This article is very important for the healthy functioning of democracy.
        - For all these reasons, Dr. Ambedkar described Article 32 as the heart and the soul of the whole Indian constitution.

**Writs**

- - A Writ is a customized/specific type of order.
    - The concept of the writ has been adopted from England.
    - Power to issue the writ is writ jurisdiction.
    - Under Indian Constitution, the writ jurisdiction is enjoyed by the Supreme Court (under Article 32) and the High court (under Article 226).
    - Writ jurisdiction enables the court to issue appropriate writs for the enforcement of the rights of an individual.
    - Writ jurisdiction also implicitly confers the power of judicial review upon the Supreme Court and High Courts.
    - Under Article 32(3), **Parliament** has the power to confer writ jurisdiction by means of law on any other body (Other than Supreme Court and High Courts).

**Types of Writs**

- - **Habeas Corpus:**
        - Habeas Corpus means 'To have Body'.
        - When an individual is detained without any legal justification or is missing, then the writ of Habeas Corpus can be issued by the court ordering the relevant authority to bring the person before the court and the court can release him in case he/she is detained illegally.
        - Writs can be filed before the court by an individual or an organization and not necessarily by the aggrieved/victim himself.
        - In the case of Habeas Corpus, the principle of Locus Standi may not apply.
        - The principle of **Locus Standi** involves the right of a person to go to the court and get his rights implemented since the person himself is under detention and cannot go to the court himself.
        - The writ of _habeas corpus_ can be issued against both public authorities as well as private individuals.
        - Not issued when
            - (a) detention is lawful
            - (b) the proceeding is for contempt of a legislature or a court,
            - (c) detention is by a competent court,
            - (d) detention is outside the jurisdiction of the court.

- - **Mandamus:**
        - It literally means ‘We Command’;
        - Therefore this writ is issued in the nature of command by Judiciary against a public authority or a person holding a public office;
        - The purpose of mandamus is to command a public authority to do or not to do certain acts in the nature of public duty.
            - Mandamus can be issued to implement a public or legal right, but not a private right;
            - Mandamus cannot be issued against the President or Governor;
            - It can also not be issued against the authorities which are making use of their discretionary powers.
                - (E.g.: Speaker certifying a bill as a money bill)
    - **Prohibition:**
        - It is the writ issued only against judicial or a quasi-judicial body;
            - (Quasi-judicial refers to a non-judicial body that can interpret the law. E.g.: NGT-National Green Tribunal)
        - It ensures that these bodies remain within the limits of their jurisdiction;
        - If such a body takes up a case in excess of its jurisdiction, then the writ of prohibition can be issued by the higher judicial body to prohibit them from proceeding with the case;
            - (Here judgement has not come, proceeding going on);
            - (If the judgement has come then, Certiorari issued)
        - (E.g.: NGT taking a case which is beyond their scope; In response, SC can issue prohibition orders because it is beyond the jurisdiction of NGT)

- - **Certiorari:**
        - It is similar to prohibition except that it is issued to quash a judgement, direction or order which were issued by a lower judicial or quasi-judicial body by going in excess of its jurisdiction;
            - (Here the judgement has come)
    - **Quo warranto:**
        - It literally means -->What is your “authority”;
        - Its purpose is to ensure that a person holding a public office is qualified or competent to hold that office;

- - **Writ jurisdiction differences of SC(Art. 32) & HC(Art.226)**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Supreme Court-SC (Art.32):**|**High Court-HC (Art. 226):**|
|- - - Under Art.32 SC can issue writs only for the enforcement of FRs(Fundamental Rights);|- - - HCs can issue writs under Art.226 not only for the enforcement of FRs but also for other legal rights;|
|- - - The constitution places a duty on SC to enforce a FR.ie., SC has to implement the FR if found violated.|- - - HCs may or may not implement these rights & may suggest some other remedy;|
|- - - The writ jurisdiction of SC extends to the whole of India.|- - - The writ jurisdiction of HC is limited by the territorial jurisdiction of the HC.|

- - However, the Writ jurisdiction of HC is much wider-->(For other legal rights also they can issue writs)
        - [Rights can be FR(under Part III), outside FR but written in the constitution(E.g.: Art 300A-Right to Property), Legal rights outside the constitution(E.g.: Right to Information)]
    - Thus we see that the writ jurisdiction of HCs(Art.226) is more than SC under Art.32

### PART IV of the Indian Constitution DPSP(Directive Principles of State Policy)

- - Part IV of the Indian Constitution contains DPSP which are in the nature of directions, to the executive & the legislative wing of the state
    - They are to be observed while formulating laws and policies.
    - These principles aim at establishing **_social and economic democracy_**.
    - These principles want to establish a welfare state as against a regulatory state;
    - A regulatory state is one that performs only one main function which is to maintain law and order & carry out day to day administrative routine functions.
    - The welfare state performs a dual function whereby they promote the economic, social and cultural development of people along with performing regulatory functions.
    - These principles are in the nature of instructions to the state & they carry the aims of the people which the state must have in mind while formulating laws and policies.
    - They are **_non-justiciable_** and cannot be enforced in a court of law.
    - They are referred to as **_positive obligations_** on the state.

- - **Some DPSPs:**
        - Art.38 - says that the State shall strive to promote the welfare of people by:
            - securing a social order in which political, economic & social justice shall prevail in all the institutions of national life
            - Reducing the inequality of income & eliminating the inequality of status & opportunities.
        - Article 39 The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing—
            - Art.39(a) --> the state must ensure that men & women equally have the right to the means of livelihood;
            - Art. 39(b)-->ownership and control of material resources of the community should be so distributed so as to sub-serve the common good;
            - Art. 39(c)-->Prevent the concentration of wealth in fewer hands;
            - Art.39(d)-->Equal pay for equal work for both men & women;
            - Art. 39(e)-->People should not be forced by economic needs to take a vocation which is not suitable to their age or strength;
        - **Art.39A-**->Ensure justice to all & free legal aid to the poor;
        - Art.40-->Organise village panchayats across India;
        - Art.41-->Provide the right to work & assistance to old, sick and disabled;
        - Art. 42-->Provide humane work conditions & maternity relief;
        - Art.43-->Secure living wage & social-cultural opportunities to all workers & promote cottage industry;
        - Art.43A-->Ensure participation of workers in the management of industries;
            - Added via 42nd CAA, 1976;
        - Art.43B-->Promote cooperative societies;
            - 97th CAA
        - Art.44-->Bring Uniform Civil Code;
        - Art.45-->Provide early childhood care & education for children up to the age 6 years;
        - Art.46-->Promote educational & economic interest of SC & ST & other weaker sections & prevent their exploitation;
        - Art.47-->Promote public health & nutrition & prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs;
            - E.g.: Mid-day meal scheme, the Food security act, etc.
        - Art.48 --> Organise agriculture & animal husbandry on scientific lines &  **_prevent the slaughter of cow,_** calves & other milch & drought animals.
        - Art.48A-->Protect and improve environment & safeguard forest and wildlife;
        - Art.49-->Protect monuments and objects of national importance;
        - Art.50-->Separate judiciary from the executive in public services of the state;
        - Art.51-->Promotion of international peace

**RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND  DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICIES (DPSP)**

- - **Art 37 states that** directive principles are not enforceable in a court of law however, still they are fundamental in the governance of the country and it is the duty of the state to incorporate the directive principles in the policy formulated or laws enacted.

- - **SC in State of Madras Vs Champakam Durairajan Case 1951** held that:  “the law made to enforce the Directive Principles cannot override the Fundamental Rights and they have to conform and run subsidiary to Fundamental Rights.
        - In case of conflict between Fundamental Rights and DPSP, the Fundamental Rights will prevail”.
    - However, realizing the importance of implementing the DPSP in order to establish a welfare state the SC in **Re- Kerala Education Bill case 1957** adopted a theory of **Harmonious Construction** and held that **"**though Directive Principles can not override  FR nevertheless in determining the scope and ambit of FR the court cannot completely ignoring the DPSP and should try to give effect to both of them as much as possible".
        - The court held that: "there is no inherent conflict between FR and DPSP and it is the responsibility of the Courts to interpret of the constitution in such a way so as to implement the DPSP along with ensuring non-violation FR"
        - Supreme Court clarified that DPSP is relevant to understand the limits or restrictions on Fundamental Rights.
        - The court also clarified that if it is not possible to have both of them then the courts must implement the FR in preference to Directive Principles.
    - Thus on the basis of the above interpretation, the **SC held Bank Nationalization Act 1969 and Privy Purse Abolition Act 1971** which were enacted by Parliament to give effect to Principles under article 39 (b) and 39 (c) to be unconstitutional and void on the ground that these laws violated FR under article 14,19 and 31, however, Parliament held that this interpretation by Court will obstruct the enactment of social legislation in larger interest of society.

- - The Parliament **enacted the 25th amendment 1971** which introduced art 31 C in the constitution of India.
        - Article 31 C read that “ if State enacts a law to give effect to two principles under art 39 (b) and 39 (c) and in the process, if the law violates under art 14, 19, or 31 then the law cannot be declared unconstitutional on this ground".
    - 25th Amendment Act 1971 was however upheld by the Supreme Court in **Keshvananda Bharti Vs State of Kerala Case 1973.**
    - Now, Parliament enacted the **42nd amendment 1976** through which art 31C was again amended and in the amended form it stated that: 
        - _"_if the state enacts a law to give effect to all or any directive principles and in the process, the law violates Fundamental Rights under art 14, 19, or 31 then the law shall not be held unconstitutional and void merely on this ground"
    - Further, Parliament through **44th amendment Act 1978** removed the Right to Property under article 19 (1) (f) and Article 31 from the list of FR.
        - Now the **SC in Minerva Mills Case 1980**, held that the changes introduced in article 31C through the 42nd amendment act were **unconstitutional** because they disturbed the fine balance between Part III and Part IV and this balance itself is a part of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution.
            - The court also declared that the power of Judicial review was the part of **Basic Structure of the Indian Constitution.**
    - Thus the current situation is under article 31C the law enacted to implement the directives under articles 39 (b) and 39 (c) can prevail over 2 fundamental rights i.e. under art 14 and 19.

**UNIFORM CIVIL CODE (ART 44)**

- - **Uniform Civil Code implies that all** the sections of our society irrespective of their religion shall be treated equally according to a **National Civil Code** which shall be made keeping in mind the modern scientific values and shall apply uniformly to all irrespective of religion.
    - Uniform Civil Code covers areas like marriage, divorce, maintenance, adoption, inheritance, etc.
    - UCC will prevent the exploitation of women particularly and enhance their status.
    - Some aspects of Civil matters is already codified uniformly under the **Civil Procedure Code, Evidence Code, Transfer of Property Act,** etc.
    - It is also argued that acts like marriage, divorce, adoption, maintenance are secular by nature and the state can regulate them equally for all and that will not be a violation of the Right to Religion under art 25 and 26.

**Directives to the State outside Part 4:**

- - Though Part 4 formally deals with the provisions of Directive Principles of the State Policy there are some directives in other parts also.
    - These Directives are also non-justiciable in nature.
        - **Article 335** directs that the claims of Scheduled Caste(SC) & Schedule Tribes(ST) must be taken into consideration consistently along with the maintenance of efficiency of Administration while making appointments to the services of the Govt.
        - **Art. 350A--**directs the States & the local authorities within the states to arrange for adequate facilities for instructions in mother tongue at the primary stage to the children of Linguistic minorities;
            - (It was added by the 7th CAA, 1956)
        - **Article 351-->** directs the Govt to promote the spread of Hindi;
            - It may serve as the medium of expression of all the elements of the composite culture of India;

**Importance of DPSP:**

- - DPs(Directive Principles) have not been given automatic legal enforceability.
    - Not because they are inferior to any other part of the constitution.
    - But because they being the **positive obligation** of the state **requires time & material resources at the disposa**l of the state for their effective implementation which may not be possible in a limited timeframe.
    - **Dr BR Ambedkar** pointed out that these principles if implemented well have the potential to establish a welfare state & any Govt responsible to people shall have to implement them.
        - Otherwise, the Govt will be answerable to people in the next elections.
    - These principles may not be enforceable in the court of law, but they are enforceable in the court of people.
    - These principles also act as the testing ground to measure the performance of the Govt.
    - These principles may not enjoy legal sanctions, but they enjoy political sanctions.
    - They act as a lighthouse constantly reminding the Govt of their responsibility of taking the country towards welfarism.

**Fundamental Rights(FRs) vs DPSPs:**
