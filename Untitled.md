## HUMAN GEOGRAPHY

-   Human-caused formation
-   Resources used by human
-   Population and its distribution and related aspects e.g.- tribals etc. Social geography

## RESOURCES RELATED

-   Primary sector (directly derived from nature - agriculture, fishing, mining etc.)
-   Secondary sector - processed + value added (e.g.- factories, manufacturing)
-   Tertiary sector - services and support system for primary and secondary sector

## UNIVERSE TO EARTH

-   Universe made up of 118 elements as discovered till now.
-   The universe is made up of matter, space, time, and energy.

### UNIVERSE EXPANSION THEORY

-   It was observed by **HUBBLE** - 1920.
-   Expanding since 13.7 to 13.84 billion years before the present since **BIG BANG**.

### BIG BANG THEORY

-   Universe is started from a primordial atom-like thing.
-   The primordial atom was very small, hot, and dense.
-   Reason - All the space, matter, energy, and time existed inside it as one. They were not separated.
-   Then the **BIG BANG** happened.
-   It led to the formation of time, energy, space (expanding).
-   As the universe started expanding, the temperature cooled.
-   Lastly, the matter started taking shape.
-   Out of the space and the cooled energy - matter started taking shape in the first 3 minutes of universe formation.
-   Still, it was extremely hot form.
-   Around 4 lac years since the big bang gas state of matter formed.
-   This led to the formation of gas clouds which later became galaxies.
-   Size of clouds: 80,000 -150,000 or much more light-years.
-   These clouds were known as **GALACTIC NEBULA**.
-   They were almost fully made up of hydrogen.

### STAR FORMATION

-   Inside galaxies, at numerous locations, hydrogen accumulated forming huge lumps of gases due to gravity which finally turned into stars.
-   Inside the stars, nuclear reactions (fusion) takes place forming all elements up to Iron in the periodic table.

### TIMELINE

-   Singularity - Before 13.7 Billion Year Before Present
-   Big Bang 13.7 Billion Year Before Present
    -   Time started
    -   Energy started
    -   Space started expansion
-   Universe
-   Galaxy: 4 Lakh Years after the big bang
-   Big Stars: were formed within 1 Billion years of the Big Bang.
-   Supernova explosion
-   Stellar Nebula
-   Star + planet system
-   Solar system (5.6 to 4.6 Billion Years Before Present)
-   Earth: 4.6 Billion Years Before Present

### WHEN STARS DIE OR END

-   The bigger ones cause a huge explosion called ‘**Supernova**’ in which all other known elements of the periodic table are formed.
-   Being in a very hot state, they again formed the remains again formed a cloud-like thing called **Stellar Nebula** (Cloud inside a galaxy) which gradually form a star and planets system like our solar system.
-   Sun, 8 planets including the earth.



# EARTH

- - Planets outside our solar system are called exoplanets.
    - The temperature on earth is favourable for allowing an atmosphere to exist.
    - Allow H2O (Water) to exist in liquid, gas, and solid (physical state).
    - The liquid and gaseous states are very important for life to exist. 
    - The atmosphere and water vapour in the air make the planet habitable.
    - Hence, when we try to find or look for other planets in the universe which are habitable or where we can find life as we understand.

##### Goldilocks Zone

- - The range of distance from the star which have attributes of being habitable.(The range of distance with the right temperatures for water to remain liquid)
    - Planets found in the goldilocks zone have the possibility that life could exist on such planets. 
    - But habitable zones are not a surety in themselves that they would support life.
    - Earth lies in the habitable zone with respect to the sun and hence it is important. 

### Important aspects with respect to earth

#### _The shape of the earth_

- - If the earth would not have been rotating its shape would have been sphere.  
    - An oblate spheroid is the real shape of the rotating earth. 
    - The right shape is needed for observation and scientific purposes. 
    - The geoid is basically a term used for the shape of the earth formed by the surfaces of land and water bodies where the gravitational effect (tides in the ocean) is not considered.
    - The real name of the shape of the earth is geoid.

#### _Major movements of the earth_

- - As part of the milky way galaxy, the earth is moving along with the galaxy. (19-21 lakh km/hour)
    - As a part of the solar system moving along with the sun as the sun revolves around the centre of the milky way galaxy (8.25 lakh km/hour).
    - Revolution around the sun (1.1 lakh km/hour). 
    - Rotation on its own axis. 

#### _Minor movements_

**Axial tilt and obliquity**

- - The earth tends to change its angle of tilt between 22.1 degrees to 24.5 degrees and then come back to 22.1 degrees. 
    - This whole cycle takes around 41000 years. 

**Precession or circling of the top of the axis of the earth.** 

- - Circling of the top and bottom of the axis takes around 26000 years for one precession movement. 

**Eccentricity**

- - Earth's axis of the revolution itself tends to change its shape and path and hence after doing numerous such eccentric revolutions the earth comes back to its previous revolution path.
    - The eccentricity is mainly due to the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn and they have a cycle of 1 lakh year to 4 lakh 13000 years.

These 3 minor movements together are also known as the **Milankovitch cycle**.

##### Effects of movements of the earth

- - The movement along with the galaxy and along with the sun does not have any perceptible or felt the effect on us.
    - The Revolution of the earth on a tilted axis does give us the effect of the seasons of the year. 
    - Hence, the concept of the year. 
    - Rotation of the earth gives us day and night and hence a 24 hour day and night concept.
    - Rotation on a tilted axis gives us the concept of different durations of day and night during different parts of the year. 
    - Minor movements basically cause long-term natural climate change on the earth like the ice age.

**Axial Tilt**

- - Tilt respective to a plane of revolution is 66.5 degrees. 
    - The tilt of the axis of revolution with respect to the vertical is 23.5 degrees. 
    - But, this tilt does not remain constant always. 
    - It changes between 22.1 degrees up to 24.5 degrees and then back to 22.1 degrees in a cyclic manner over a period of 41000 years. 
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 1.png>)

**Precession**

- - The slow movement of the axis of a spinning body around another axis due to a torque (such as gravitational influence) acting to change the direction of the first axis. 
    - The pole star keeps changing after every 13000 years.
    - The Pole star now is Polaris. 
    - Pole star after 13000 years will be, Vega.

### Major features of the earth

**Latitudes and longitudes**

- - These are man-made lines of imaginary lines.
    - We make latitudes and longitudes, to mark and know exactly the location of any place. 
    - Same way as we use graph paper X and Y-axis to know the location of a point on the graph paper.

**Latitude**

- - When we keep the earth vertical with respect to the axis of rotation then the horizontal circles made on the earth's surface are known as latitudes.
    - As a standard, the biggest horizontal circle made in the middle of such a position of the earth is called the equator. 
    - The Equator is considered zero degrees latitude. 
    - With respect to the plane of the equator, we find that the poles where the axis of rotation passes through the earth are at an angle of 90 degrees. 
    - Poles are located at 90 degrees. The north pole is 90 degrees north and the south pole is 90 degrees south. 
    - Hence all the other circles are measured with respect to the plane of the equator.
    - Latitudes at 23.5 degrees are known as tropics - Tropic of cancer (23.5 North) and tropic of Capricorn (23.5 South). 
    - Latitudes at 66.5 North is called Arctic circle and 66.5 south is called the Antarctic circle.
    - Every 1- degree latitude is 111 km apart though this distance also does not always remain the same because the earth's surface is not perfectly circular and hence as we go from the equator to the pole this 111 km approximately also keeps increasing slightly.

**Longitude**

- - When we draw a semi-circle from one pole to the other pole on the earth's surface.
    - This semi-circle is called longitude.
    - As many distinct semi-circles that we can draw this way on the earth's surface from pole to pole are the different longitudes that we get.
    - The standard longitude for the whole earth with respect to which other longitudes are measured and named is known as the prime meridian.
    - The prime meridian is passing through the royal observatory Greenwich England.
    - When we complete the prime meridian circle on the other side and considering the prime meridian as zero degrees the other side semi circle becomes 180 degrees.
    - Roughly, this 180-degree longitude is known as the international dateline which passes over the pacific ocean. 
    - Hence giving as zero degree and 180-degree longitudes.
    - All the other longitudes East of the Prime meridian up to the 180 - degree longitude are numbered with respect to their angle from the zero degrees latitude and known as east longitudes.
    - For example - a longitude located at an angle of 5 degrees with respect to the prime meridian will be known as 5 degrees east longitude and so on up to 180 degrees. 
    - Similarly, longitudes on the west of the prime meridian are similarly named as west longitudes.
    - The distance between longitudes at the equator is approx. 111 km and at poles, the distance is zero km. 
    - When we see this 111 km distance between for every degree of latitude and longitude and for higher precession when we want to further divide every degree of latitude or longitudes we use the system of 1- degree angle = 60 minutes of angle.
    - Hence every one minute is approximately 2 km.

**Major features on the earth with atlas**

- - The major physical features in the physical map.
    - The ocean floor is the land below the oceans.
    - Continent - land above the ocean. 
    - On the land above the ocean, features are mountains, plateaus, and plains. 
    - On the ocean - mountains are called mid-oceanic ridges.
    - For plains in the ocean, we will have a basin. 
    - For plateaus, the word high will be used sometimes in oceans. 
    - The ocean maps, oceanic shelves are the shallow land near the coast having a depth of few meters to up to 300 meters. 
    - Green regions are plains closer to sea level. Darker the green, closer they are to the sea. 
    - Brown coloured regions are higher regions in the physical map, the darker the brown the higher the place
    - In the ocean, the darker shades mean deeper regions, and light blue means shallow regions.
    - Desserts are shown in yellow colours.
    - Basins in the continent are generally the plains formed or affected by rivers.
    - Many times even the mountainous areas through which such rivers flow are considered as part of the basin.
    - Sea is the region of the ocean near the land or continent that was given a local name to distinguish it or mark it within the larger ocean.
    - **Peninsula** is with respect to the continent. The land surrounded by water from 3 sides is called a peninsula.
    - **Bay or gulf** is water which is surrounded by land by 3 sides.
        - Bays: Generally smaller and shallower indentations compared to gulfs. They provide some shelter from the open ocean but are not as deeply cut into the landmass.
    - **Isthmus**, a strip of land connecting two landmasses. Ex- Isthmus of Panama.
    - **Strait or channel**, a water body/strip of water connecting two bigger water bodies.
    - The **cape** is the tip of the peninsula.

**Revolution of earth and its effects on the earth**

- - Earth's tilt remains constant with respect to the plane of revolution and the vertical plane of revolution in the direction of the pole star, Polaris at present but the most important thing to note here is that the earth's tilt with respect to the sun is not constant.
    - In a year on two days first around 21st September and 2nd around 21st march is known as equinox days.
    - The earth's tilt with respect to the sun is zero which simply means neither the north pole nor the south pole is tilted towards or away from the sun and is rather equidistant from the sun on these two days.
    - Though throughout the revolution, the earth is tilted towards the pole star.
    - On equinox days, the earth's tilt with respect to the sun is zero degrees.
    - On two other days of the year known as the solstice days on 21st June and 21st December, the earth is so tilted while orbiting around the sun and pointing towards the pole star that it is maximum tilted with respect to the sun also. 
    - Around the 21st June solstice, this tilt is 23.5 degrees with respect to the sun so that the northern hemisphere of the earth is tilted towards the sun and the southern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun.
    - Around 21st December the earth is again tilted with respect to the sun at 23.5 degrees which is the maximum tilt with respect to the sun but on this day, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun and the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun.
    - On solstice days, the earth has a tilt of a maximum of 23.5 degrees but in different solstices the direction of tilt is opposite.

#### _EFFECT OF EARTH REVOLUTION ON TILTED AXIS_

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 3.png>)

**Circle of Illumination**

- - It is an imaginary circle on the earth, so that side of the earth towards the sun is illuminated and the side of the earth away from the sun is dark.
    - It is always a vertical circle over the earth.
    - No matter whether the earth is tilted or not with respect to the sun during the different parts of the year. 
    - Only on the equinox days when the earth is not tilted with respect to the sun.
    - On the solstice days, the sunray falls vertical at a point 23.5 degrees north of the equator.
    - The latitude passing through this point is 23.5 degrees North latitude hence simply said on the June solstice the sunray falls vertical at places located on 23.5 degrees North latitude as the earth rotates.
    - Similarly, in the December solstice, the Northern hemisphere will be tilted away and the southern hemisphere will be tilted towards the sun hence on this day, the sunray falling perpendicular to the earth's surface will be located 23.5 degrees south of the equator.
    - Hence, on this day, all places on 23.5 degrees south latitude will receive the sunray perpendicular over them.
    - Simply said, on the march and September equinoxes the sunrays fall perpendicular over the equator whereas, on the June and December solstice days, the sun rays fall perpendicular over the 23.5 degrees North and south respectively.
    - Hence, we can say that the sun never goes beyond 23.5 degrees latitude.

**Seasons and day and night changes**

- - The real reason for the seasons is not the distance but the tilt wrt the sun during the diff parts of the year.
    - Because of the tilt with respect to the sun, the hemisphere tilted towards the sun receives more sunlight whereas the hemisphere tilted away from the sun receives less part of the sunlight. 
    - As we can understand, from the may solstice diagram, that as we move from the equator towards the 90 degrees north pole, the length of daylight goes on increasing with an increase in latitude and the duration of night respectively goes on decreasing.
    - At 66.5 North degree latitude, we find that it is fully on the daylight side hence having 24-hour daylight on this day (may solstice) and hence no night.
    - Further, all the higher latitude circles will be on the daylight side and would also be experiencing 24-hour daylight including the poles. 
    - On the other hand, on this June solstice day, as one travels from the equator towards the south pole 90 degrees south, with an increase in latitude, the duration of daylight goes on decreasing whereas the duration of the night goes on increasing because this hemisphere is experiencing the winter season. 
    - When one reaches the 66.5 degrees south latitude circle, we find that it is experiencing a 24 hour night as no part of the circle goes toward the illuminated side hence the length of daylight is zero hours.
    - The same phenomenon is observed for higher latitudes here also up to 90 degrees south. 
    - The phenomena of 24 hours daylight or 24 night are generally related to the poles but here we find that it starts from the 66.5 degrees latitude circle itself.
    - Hence, these 66.5 degrees latitudes are known as polar circles.
    - The north pole experiences 6-month daylight from 21st march till 21st September.
    - During this period south pole experienced 24 hours 6 months nights.
    - From 21st September Equinox till 21st march equinox, the north poles experience 24 hours 6 month night whereas the south pole experiences 24 hours 6-month daylight.
    - The date of equinox and solstice does not always remain the same and they keep changing from 19th to 22nd/ 23rd. 
    - In terms of the sunlight, the cycle goes like dark in the night and then dawn when the sun just rises and then daylight, then dusk and then evening twilight and then the darkness of the night again. 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Latitude|24-hour day/Night|
|90|6 months|
|80|more days < 6 months|
|70|fewer days > 1|
|66.5|1 day|

**ROTATION OF EARTH**

- - 24 hours is the time taken for places on any given longitude to complete a full rotation with respect to the sun. 
    - In terms of angles, there are 360-degree longitudes on the earth, and hence the time gap between one-degree longitude the time difference will be 4 minutes. 
    - The time on our planet is kept with respect to the different longitudes for different countries.
    - The standard time for the world is calculated with respect to the time at Greenwich at zero longitudes of the prime meridian.
    - As the earth rotates from west to east hence the eastern longitudes experience sunrise before Greenwich longitude or the western longitudes. 
    - All the longitudes east of Greenwich longitudes are called east longitudes. 
    - 180 degrees is called the international dateline.

**Time Zone**

- - The standard time is calculated from zero degrees prime meridian. 
    - We will gain 4 minutes with each degree moving east and lose 4 minutes with each degree west. 
    - Indian is 5 hours 30 minutes ahead of Greenwich prime meridian time. 
    - India's longitude is **82.5** degrees east of Greenwich and India's standard timeline.

- - A time zone is an area that observes a uniform standard time for legal, commercial, and social purposes.
    - Time zones tend to follow the boundaries between countries and their subdivisions instead of strictly following longitude because it is convenient for areas in frequent communication to keep the same time.
    - India has only a one-time zone.
    - The country has officially observed India Standard Time (IST) 82.5 degrees east since 1947.
    - There are ongoing demands for 2 time zones in India.
    - India is geographically the second-largest country not to have multiple time-zones
    - India stretches from 97 degrees 25 minutes East in Arunachal to 68 degrees 7 minutes East in Gujarat — almost 30 degrees of longitude which is more than enough to have two time zones.
    - Northeast lose important daylight which can be used productively as the sun rises as early as 4 am in summer and offices open at 10.
    - Many people in India operate in a time zone that is not an appropriate diurnal cycle for them.

**Daylight time**

- - Countries that are in higher latitudes generally experience varying lengths of daylight during summers and winters to make out or to gain maximum from available sunlight during the day.
    - Some countries follow the practice of daylight saving time.
    - Here, when the winters get over (during the spring season) they set their clocks one hour ahead.
    - This way as per their clock, they get one hour of sunlight in the evening. 
    - Then, when the summers get over (during the autumn season) they again set back their clock to the previous normal time.
    - This way during their productive seasons they get one extra hour of sunlight as per their clock.

**Solar and lunar eclipse**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 4.png>)

- - When the sun is shadowed by the moon so the sun is not visible - Solar eclipse.
    - When the moon is shadowed by earth blocking sunlight is lunar eclipse.
    - Diamond Ring phenomenon is observed along the peripheral region of the totality trail.
    - The orbit of the revolution of the moon is tilted slightly with respect to the orbit of the revolution of the earth(5.1°). 
    - Because of this mostly even when -
        - A) Even if the moon is between the sun and the earth;
        - B) The earth is between the sun and the moon, the shadow of the moon or earth does not fall on the other (on earth or moon).
    - Few times in a year, the planes of the orbit of earth and moon are so positioned along with the positions of the earth and moon that the earth, moon, and sun all fall in the same line. 
    - Here, the sequence of earth and moon with respect to the sun will decide which kind of eclipse we will get. 
        - A) If the sequence in the line is sun-moon-earth, the shadow of the moon will fall on the earth's surface and at such places on the earth's surface, the sun will not be visible, hence experiencing the solar eclipse.
        - B) If in the line the sequence is sun-earth-moon, that the shadow of the earth will fall on the moon and hence it will be seen as a lunar eclipse.

**Formation of different layers of regions of the earth**

- - The formation of the solar system started approximately 8.5 billion years before the present from the supernova explosion of the protosun (precursor star of the sun).
    - The stellar nebula was formed.
    - This initial earth had an atmosphere made up of the leftover hydrogen and helium gas since the earth's formation.
    - This atmosphere was known as the first atmosphere of the earth.

- - But, at that time, the earth was hot, the sun was also in its initial phases and hence the first atmosphere of the earth was blown away because -

A) The gases were too light.

B)  The sun's heat was able to blow them away.

- - Around 4.4 billion years before the present, the earth had a major collision known as the big splat or giant impact with another relatively half-sized planet, mentioned in some sources, Theia.
    - From this collision, we got 2 things - The present earth and the present moon of earth.
    - The earth so formed this time was having a hot, molten surface so formed made up of lava.
    - Gradually, from such hot molten surfaces, as more eruptions rose, it released gases like ammonia, hydrogen, helium, water, carbon dioxide, methane, rocky material, dust, ash, etc.
    - The gases so released went on to envelope or cover the molten earth forming the second atmosphere of the earth.
    - Mostly rich in carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia but not in nitrogen or oxygen.
    - The second atmosphere also had H2O as water vapor which went on to form clouds as more and more gases erupted.
    - These clouds started causing rains which happened for millions of years, eventually leading to the cooling of the earth's surface and the formation of global oceans, covering the whole earth. 
    - Hence, before 4 billion years before the present, the earth already had a second atmosphere and a global ocean covering the whole earth.
    - Simultaneously the earth's molten surfaces were also gradually cooling over these millions of hundreds of years. 
    - As earth lost its heat to space and was also gradually cooled by global oceans.
    - Hence, as the molten minerals cooled and solidified, they led to the formation of rocks, over periods, the rocks led to the formation of a rocky layer below the oceans as a rocky ocean floor.
    - This way the oceans floors were formed as a rocky surface the way we know them presently. 
    - This way the first rocky surface was formed below the oceans.

**Formation of continents and Islands**

- - The ocean rocky floor doesn't remain forever once formed, rather it sinks back partly into the molten interior and again melts so that the lighter rocky molten part tends to rise again through volcanic eruptions.
    - When such lighter material solidifies, it initially leads to the formation of Islands.
    - When many such Islands get together they lead to the formation of continents.
    - This is how gradually, Islands and continents also started forming.
    - Such formations started appearing on the earth's surface around 4 billion years before the present.
    - Hence, this way around 4 billion years before present, the earth had;

A) The second atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia.

B) A global ocean covering most of the earth.

C) Islands and some initial continents.

- - But still, our present atmosphere is rich in O2 and N2 was still to form.
    - Also, at that time, there was nearly no life on earth.

**Evolution of life and present atmosphere (third atmosphere)**

- - Around 3.8 billion years before the present, single-cell life forms evolved on the earth.
    - Most probably it was in the ocean (as per some current sources, life evolved earlier than 4 billion years before the present).
    - For the evolution of life, along with the other physical atmospheric conditions like temperature, moisture presence of some chemicals are also necessary such as phosphorus, sulphur, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc.
    - They gave us nucleic acid and amino acids which are required for life forms and protein formation.
    - These are complex compounds, and these require reactions and these reactions are not easy to occur on land (solid or gaseous medium).
    - They need a liquid medium for easy formation. 
    - For the formation of life single-cell life forms, the required conditions were most probably fulfilled in the oceans different chemicals were present in the oceans dissolved from the atmosphere, brought down by the rains to the oceans, or dissolved from the ocean floor rocks.
    - The required energy for such life-forming reactions was provided by lightning from the sky during rains or volcanic eruptions over the ocean floors. 
    - This way as per the most accepted life evolution theories, life evolved on the earth as single-cell life forms around 3.8 billion years before present either near the top surface of the ocean or at the bottom surface of the oceans due to volcanoes. 
    - But, these life forms neither required too much oxygen nor produced too much oxygen. 
    - Photosynthesising bacteria's evolved in the oceans around 3 billion to 2.5 billion years before the present.
    - Gradually the photosynthesizing organisms led to making the oceans saturated with the oxygen around 2000 million years before present and gradually this oxygen started leaking into the atmosphere as simultaneously the other gases were being dissolved and taken to oceans.
    - Hence, slowly, more complex living forms evolved as the atmosphere was also evolving gradually into an oxygen-rich atmosphere.
    - Around 530 million years before present life started to creep from the oceans to the land in the coastal areas as the atmosphere was now rich in oxygen to support such life and gradually more and more photosynthesizing life forms evolved and spread over the land, they absorbed more of CO2  from the atmosphere and released more of O2 into the atmosphere.
    - This way the present third atmosphere having negligible CO2 and substantial O2 was formed.
    - Throughout these reactions, when nitrogen gas was being released, it being a relatively non-reactive gas, it accumulate more and more in the atmosphere.
    - This is how finally the earth had a third atmosphere and made oceans and continents full of life.

### EVOLUTION OF EARTH'S AND ATMOSPHERE

- - The atmosphere goes up to 3500 km.
    - Living forms survive a maximum within 20 km in the atmosphere, called the biosphere.
    - Parts of Biosphere - oceans, land, and atmosphere.
    - The Interior of the earth goes up to 6400 km.

**INTERIOR OF THE EARTH**

##### Evidence

**Direct Evidence**

- - Mining (3-4 km).
    - Drills - Research (9-12 km).
    - Volcanoes (400 km).
    - The limitation of direct sources about the earth's interior is that it doesn't come from deeper than 400 km.

**Indirect evidence or inferences**

### Characteristics of the earth

**Temperature** 

- - When we go deeper from the surface of the earth the temperature toward the interior goes on increasing at the rate of 1-degree Celsius for every 32 meters of depth.
    - Hence, this helps us in predicting the temperature of the interior of the earth, at least to a certain depth, because we were not sure whether this rate remains constant (now we are certain that this cannot be a constant rate).
    - Because at this rate the temperature at the centre would be 2 lakh degrees Celsius but as per our advanced sources, we now know that the temperature at the centre of the earth is around 5000 degrees Celsius. 
    - The surface of the sun and upper layer of the exosphere has the same temperature i.e., 5000 degrees Celsius.

**Density**

- - Density = Total mass of earth/total volume of earth = 5.5 gm/cm cube.
    - Continental crust density - 2.7 g/cm3, Ocean Crust density - 3 g/cm3.
    - Rocks coming with volcanoes = 3.3 gm/cm cube.
    - From temperature and density, we can infer which material might be present at such depth. 
    - Average density at centre of the earth came out from inference to be 13 gm/cm cube.

**Pressure**

- - Pressure helps us predict the physical state (solid, liquid, gas) of the material inside the earth. 

**Role of seismic energy**

- - Gravity Keep changing slightly from place to place and hence we can understand what mass variation might be there in the earth's interior at those locations.
    - The magnetic field of the earth is an outcome of different magnetic materials inside the earth along with other factors such as earth's rotation etc. 
    - The earth's magnetic field also keeps varying from place to place and hence helps us in understanding what kind of magnetic material might be there inside at different places. 
    - The earthquake waves or the seismic waves are created due to seismic activities inside the earth which causes the release of seismic energy, and this energy travels in the form of seismic waves. 
    - Seismic activities in the earth's interior take place up to a depth of 700 km from mean sea level.
    - Below the earth's surface generally in the rocky region, some cracks might be there known as faculty or fault lines.
    - They might spread up to 100 or 1000s km. 
    - Some movements inside the earth might cause tension, compression, or friction, and hence energy might build up in such regions over a long period.
    - Hence, gradually substantial energy gets stored in such regions, and when the elasticity limit of the region is surpassed, then a sudden release of all the energy might take place, which is known as seismic activity. 
    - Such seismic activities release a tremendous amount of energy stored over 100 or 1000s years. 
    - This seismic activity energy released tends to shake the earth's interior by releasing shaking energy waves released from the location of seismic activities. 
    - The location of the seismic activity is known as the focus or hypocentre. 
    - Hence, the seismic energy released from the focus takes the earth's interior by traveling as seismic body waves. 
    - The body waves hit the earth's surface at different locations on the earth's surface after traveling the earth's interior as they travel inside the earth, the energy goes on decreasing, hence maximum seismic energy is transferred to the surface of the earth at the location which is vertically above the focus. 
    - This location is known as the epicentre of the seismic activity which is vertically above the hypocentre on the earth's surface.
    - When the body waves reach the earth's surface, on the earth surface they generate new waves known as surface seismic waves.
    - **These surface seismic waves vibrate the land surface, this vibration is felt by us as an earthquake.**
    - This is how the surface seismic waves create earthquakes.
    - Hence, we have 2 types of seismic waves - seismic body waves and seismic surface waves. 
    - The surface waves help us understand earthquakes.
    - The seismic body waves generated from the focus, generally travel mostly throughout the earth's interior before reaching the earth's surface at different places, where they are sensed by a device known as a seismograph. 
    - Hence by studying the seismic body waves, which reach the earth's surface at different locations, we can better understand the earth's interior region to which the seismic body waves must have travelled. 
    - This way the seismic body waves help us understand the earth's interior much better. 
    - These are the only saves that travel through the body of the earth (even gravitational waves travel through the interior of the earth and hence in very recent years our understanding of gravitational waves will also help us understand the earth and the universe better.

**Characteristics of body waves**

- - P waves are known primary and S waves are known as secondary.
    - P waves travel faster than the secondary waves and hence they reach the surface of the earth also relatively faster.
    - P waves are longitudinal whereas S waves are transverse.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 6.png>)
    - P wave can travel in all mediums i.e., solid, liquid, and gases.
    - S waves can travel only in solid medium.
        - because there is no mechanism in fluids to drive the motion perpendicular to the wave.
    - P waves bend when the density of the medium changes.

##### How P and S waves help to understand the interior of the earth.

- - The zone between 103° and 145° from the epicenter was identified as the shadow zone for both types of waves.

**S waves role** 

- - The entire zone beyond 103° does not receive S-waves, and hence this zone is identified as the shadow zone of S-waves.

**P waves role**

- - The shadow zone of P-waves is between 103° and 145° away from the epicentre.
    - This is because P-waves are refracted when they pass through the transition between the semisolid mantle and the liquid outer core.
    - However, the seismographs located beyond 145° from the epicentre, record the arrival of P-waves, but not that of S-waves.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 7.png>)

**S-Waves:**

- - As we have seen in the S-waves diagram that considering the epicentre angle of any given earthquake with respect to the centre of the earth as 0*
    - When we try to measure the places up to where the body waves appear on the earth surface, we find that they appear only up to the region which is up to 105* or 103*
    - This region on the earth surface where the S-waves does not appear is known as the S-Wave Shadow Zone 
    - From the S-Wave Shadow Zones diagram for various earthquakes, we finally conclude that there is a region at the centre of the earth where the S-Waves are not able to pass through
    - This is because it must be in a liquid state and having a spherical shape (deduced from the constant angle 105* for all the earthquakes)
    - Hence simply said the S-waves practical observation tells us the state, shape and depth known as core.

**What P-Waves tell is about Earth Interior:**

- - we observe in reality the P-Waves appears on the surface only in the region from 0* up to 105* and then it reappears on the earth's surface in the region between 145* to 180*
    - But it is not observed in the region between 105* to 145*
    - Hence from this, we deduce how P-Waves must be travelling in the earth's interior.
    - Hence they give us the final picture as per their observation 
    - In understanding the P-Wave role we already use what S-Wave has informed us about the core  
    - Hence, from the P-Wave diagram observation, we conclude that the P-Waves which do not enter the core region before they appear on the earth's surface 
    - Appear up to a maximum of 105* with respect to (wrt) the epicentre i.e. 0*
    - Whereas the P-Waves which enter the core bend twice and are not able to come out on the earth's surface between 105* to 145*
    - They come out only in the region between 145* to 180*
    - This is mainly due to the bending of the P-Wave due to change in the medium (solid to liquid and liquid to solid) as well as change in density.
    - Hence the bending tells us how much has been the change in the density
    - Hence, simply said the P-Wave observations help us understand the density difference in the core wrt to its surroundings 
    - Hence from P-Wave and S-Wave, density and state-related observations, we can figure out which minerals must be found in the core region

### Earth's Interior

**Chemical Characteristic (What Chemicals):**

- - Crust: The crust which is primarily made up of SiAl i.e. Silica and Alumina 
    - It includes both the continental crust and oceanic crust 
    - The thickness of the Ocean crust is 5 Km and that of the continental crust varies from 30 to 100 Km
    - Plains having thickness of 30 Km; plateau of about 70 Km and mountains around 100 Km
    - The rock density of oceanic crust is 3 gm/cc and that of continental crust is around 2.7 gm/cc
    - Oceanic crust is denser because it has some Magnesia along with Silica and Alumina 
    - On the other hand, Continental crust has no Magnesia but only Silica and Alumina and hence lighter than Oceanic crust
    - Mantle Region: Below the Oceanic crust comes to the mantle region and is made up of SiMa i.e. Silica and Magnesia (Oxide of Magnesium)
    - Core Region: Below the mantle region is the Core made up of NiFe i.e. Nickel and Iron
    - Hence, we can say that crust, mantle and core are chemical characteristics based classification of the earth's interior 

**Physical Characteristics of Earth's Interior (What State):**

- - The earth's interior is broadly divided into solid and liquid regions 
    - Solid Region: Further, the solid region is divided into rocky solid (Lithosphere); Weak Solid (like plastic which can bend i.e. Aesthenosphere) and nonrocky continuous hard solid (Mesosphere). All these three are part of Mantle.
    - Another fourth solid region is the Inner Core is another hard solid
    - Liquid Region- Outer Core is the liquid region
    - Lithosphere - Whole crust and top rocky mantle.
    - The oceanic lithosphere is around 10 Km thick whereas continental crust is up to 200 Km thick
    - The asthenosphere is the plastic solid which is up to the depth of 700 Km from the surface of the earth/sea level
    - The mesosphere is up to 2900 Km from the surface of the earth/sea level
    - The core is divided into outer core and inner core
    - The Outer Core (liquid) is up to a depth of 5100 Km and the inner core (solid) up to 6400 Km from the surface of the earth/sea level
    - All the depths are from the surface of the earth i.e. sea level
    - The whole core is also known as Barrysphere.

**Discontinuities in the Earth's Interior**:

- - All these different regions in the earth interior are separated from each other by Zones known as dis-continuities as shown below
    - The crust has an upper and lower section and the discontinuity between them is Conard discontinuity 
    - The crust is separated from Mantle by Moho/Mohorovicic Discontinuity 
    - The Mantle is further divided into upper and lower mantle and the discontinuity between them is known as Reppitti Dis-continuity 
    - The Mantle is separated from Core by Gutenberg Discontinuity
    - The core is also divided into the lower and upper regions which are called Lehman Bullen

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 9.png>)

**Earth's Magnetism:**

- - Some metals like Iron, Nickel, etc show magnetic characters
    - Every magnet has two poles i.e. magnetic north and south poles 
    - There are some natural magnets and some are induced magnets that are created due to currents 
    - Earth's magnetism is an induced magnetism and is induced when 3 phenomena occur simultaneously perpendicular to each other 
    - These three are electric current(eddy currents), physical movement and induced magnetism
    - If any two are simultaneously present then the third is created.
    - Hence the earth creates magnetism because in the earth's interior some huge electric current is flowing along with large scale physical movement of material on which magnetism can be induced
    - The same principle applies to magnetism created on different bodies in the universe like other planets, stars, etc 
    - In the case of the earth; the earth's core has conducting metals in every hot molten liquid state which generate some kind of huge current flow inside the earth's interior 
    - The substantial speed of rotation of the earth generates the required physical movement and hence as these two conditions are fulfilled, the third phenomenon i.e. induced magnetism is created on the earth known as Geo-magnetism
    - By the same logic in the solar system, magnetism is created on many planets, some of their natural satellites as well as in the sun
    - Two planets Venus and Mars do not have magnetism because Venus rotates very slow so the required physical movement is not present.
    - Mars is very cold at its core or rather it has cooled down and does not have the required currents generated

**Importance of Earth's Magnetism:**

- - Magnetism has the characteristic of deflecting electrically charged particles
    - Earth has a magnetic field that creates a shield around itself from charged particles coming from space as solar charged particles known as solar winds which have the ability to destroy all life on earth as one of its effects
    - The solar winds are deflected by the earth's magnetic field from reaching the earth.
    - Due to the distortion of the earth's magnetic field, some solar-charged particles are able to reach near the earth's poles where they create moving lights in the sky known as Aurora
    - Also known as northern lights in the northern poles which are also known as Aurora Borealis and in southern pole it is known as Aurora Australis.
    - The earth's magnetic field is also used for navigation; for example, earlier in the seas magnets were used for navigation
    - Even some birds and animals use the earth's magnetic field for navigation. 
    - In recent years there has been news of shifting the earth's magnetic pole from the Canadian Polar region to the Russian Polar region
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 3.jpeg>)

- - It is to be noted that the earth's magnetic field reverses itself over a short period of few thousand years at an interval of few lakh years. 
    - This is known as the magnetic reversal of the earth's pole which is a natural phenomenon and has happened many times since the earth's formation 
    - Magnetic Reversals: Occasionally, over much longer periods (hundreds of thousands to millions of years), the entire magnetic field can flip, with the north and south poles reversing positions. This is called a geomagnetic reversal.
    - The reason for this magnetic reversal is not very well known
    - Though in recent years we had seen slightly faster shifting of the magnetic poles we still do not know if earth's magnetic fields are reversing finely, etc

### Movements of ocean floor and continents

- - Earlier more than a century ago our understanding of the land surface, continent, and ocean floor was that they are fixed on the earth's surface.
    - Though, in the last few centuries, starting from the 16th century, some scholars had started pointing out that the different continents seemed to be fitting together as part of a bigger block.
    - One of the first scholars to bring this out was Abraham Ortelius in 1596 and later on even Antonia Pellegrini but nobody till the beginning of the 20th century talked about any movements of the continents or the ocean floors.
    - It was in 1912, that the continental drift theory was given by Alfred Wegener, in which Wegner for the first time stated and tried to explain the movements of the continents over the ocean floors, just like ships move over the ocean.

#### _CONTINENTAL DRIFT THEORY_

**Why did Alfred Wegner say so**

- - Alfred Wegener was a palaeoclimatologist.
    - He was trying to understand the climate of the past of the earth.
    - For this, he collected vegetation and animal fossils from different continents on the earth. 
    - Because the vegetation and the animals give us clear hints about the climate of the period when these animals and plants existed. 
    - Wegener while collecting evidence from different parts of the world found some contradicting evidence as compared to the present time.
    - In the present day, polar frozen regions he found evidence of very hot equatorial tropical type of climate, whereas in the present day hot equatorial regions, he found evidence of the polar frozen type of climate in the past.
    - This was very confusing and there were just two ways to explain this or to clarify this confusion.  
    - First, in the past, both the poles were so exposed to the sun that they had hotter equatorial climates whereas the present-day equatorial climate region was less exposed to the sun that doesn't seems logical.
    - Hence simply said as per this explanation the climatic belts of the earth have not shifted, rather the continents themselves have shifted or drifted.
    - The second possibility that he thought of was that the present continents have moved or drifted from their past positions so that earlier the continents were so positioned that the tropical equatorial hot regions were in the hot climate belt on the earth and on the other hand the cold polar evidence regions on the continent were in the cold climate belts.  
    - This seemed to be more logical and he also found support in the words of scholars like Ortelius and Pellegrini.
    - Hence, he started looking for evidence and gave a complete theory in 1912.

**What does the theory say**

- - 250 million years ago all the present-day continents were joined together and were joined together known as Pangea.
    - Pangea was surrounded by a global ocean, super ocean Panthalassa.
    - Pangea started breaking into 2 groups, Laurasia and Gondwanaland where Laurasia comprised of North America and Eurasia except India.
    - Northern parts of India were not even formed by this time.
    - Gondwana land was made up of all the other continents of the present including peninsular India.
    - Laurasia had started drifting forming a sea in between known as the Tethys Sea. 
    - Around 145 million years before the present as Laurasia kept drifting northwards, Gondwanaland also started breaking as present - day South America and Africa separated from present - day Antarctica and Australia. 
    - Simultaneously peninsular India also separated from Gondwanaland and Africa and started drifting northwards. 
    - Around 65 million years ago as the northward drifting off all the broken continents continued the western continents of South America and North America also started drifting westwards. 
    - At present, we find that all these continents continue to drift Northward and westward and hence have reached their present positions.
    - Simply said Wegner in his theory said that starting from 250 million years ago all the continents were joined together a Pangea, gradually due to breaking of Pangea into different parts and simultaneous northward and westward drifting of these parts (continents), we get the present-day location of the present-day continents over the earth.

##### Evidence of Continental drift theory

**1st evidence - Jig-Saw Fit**

- - The continent shapes are taken and when we try to put them together, they are a perfect fit as part of a jig-saw puzzle. 
    - Some scholars criticized the jig-saw fit evidence of Wegner saying that the ocean surface waves might have hit continuously, the continent's coast, and hence over 250 million years, the coast shapes must have changed by waves. 
    - Hence, of the continent shapes are fitting together at present times, that doesn't mean that in the past also they were fitting. 
    - Another scholar Bullard in 1964, much after the death of Wegner made the continent-shaped map of different continents measured at the depth of 1000 fathom. (1 fathom is 1.8 meters).
    - He said that because at such depth, ocean surface waves cannot erode and break, the continental edges hence the same shapes would have been there for the continents even 250 million years before present. 
    - Hence, if these continental shapes, also fit together well then Wegner's jigsaw fit evidence was right.
    - As he was successful in making such maps and fitting them together, hence he proved that this criticism was wrong and even, in reality, the continents were together.

**2nd Evidence - Rocks on different continents**

- - He found that rocks on different continents had similar age and chemical characteristics.
    - Rocks on the eastern coast of South America had similar age and chemical characteristics as rocks on the western coast of Africa. 
    - The question was how so far away, rocks had similar age and chemical characteristics. 
    - Wegner answered this question by saying if we place the continents the way he is suggesting in his theory, for Pangea.
    - Then because the continents were joined together, hence the rocks must have formed together much before Pangea started breaking (the rocks on these coasts are as old as 2000 million years). 
    - Then as the continents broke and moved away the rocks on the coast were separated and coastal deposits were deposited on these newly formed coasts. 
    - Therefore, the coastal rocks are thousand of million years old and similar but the coastal deposits are less than 250 million years old and hence new.

**3rd evidence - Placer deposits**

- - A placer deposit or placer is an accumulation of valuable minerals formed by gravity separation from a specific source rock during sedimentary processes.
    - The mineral rocks might be far away from the mineral deposits because the deposits are brought by different mediums like waves, rivers, etc. Such deposits are called placer deposits.
    - Wegner found placer deposits of gold on the Ghana coast of Africa but there were no gold mines nearby.
    - Whereas goldmines are found on the Brazilian coast and Wegner said that when the continents were joined together as told in his theory then the gold must have moved as placer deposit from the Brazilian gold mines to the African coast.
    - Then the continents broker away and the placer deposits separated from the mines. 

**4th evidence - Fossil evidence**

- - Fossils of Cynognathus, Glossopteris, Lystrosaurus, and Mesosaurus were found by Wegner on present-day continents. 
    - But, Wegner said if you put the continents together as per his theory in Pangea then we can see definite belts of migration of these animals and plants over Pangea before it started breaking. 
    - Hence, he said that the continents must have been together.

**5th Evidence - Tillites**

- - The Tillites or till deposits are deposits of broken rock parts that move at the bottom of glaciers hence they keep moving till the glaciers are moving as some of these deposits go on getting deposited at different places. 
    - Then gradually, if the climate of the region changes and the glaciers completely melt away with no sign of water left behind, the till deposits become the evidence of glaciers in those regions. 
    - This is how even millions of years later after the glaciers have disappeared, from the till deposits we come to know that in these regions glaciers were present earlier. 
    - Wegner found till deposits evidence in different parts of the world in tropical equatorial regions also.
    - Many of these regions are tropical regions now and hence it is not possible to have glaciers in these regions but not in their neighbouring regions.
    - Wegner explains that glaciers in these regions were only possible if we place these regions as Pangea around the south pole and all these regions at that time were inside the southern polar circle.
    - Hence, these regions had glaciers as part of Pangea. 
    - Gradually they broke and reached the present location. 

**Weaknesses of continental drift theory** 

- - Wegner talked about the movements of the continents in a northward and westward direction, whereas practical observations have shown that the continents, or rather the crust drift in all directions.
    - Wegener started nearly 250 million years before the present whereas in reality it has been observed that the continents have been moving or drifting nearly since their formation which was around 4000 million years before the present.  
    - Wegner started from the last supercontinent and then talked about the breaking of the supercontinent and the formation of the different continents of present times. 
    - But, in reality, in the past, this process has taken place many times and different supercontinents have formed and then broken with drifting of the continents of those times and then later on those continents again coming together to form newer supercontinents.
    - In this sequence, Pangea was the last supercontinent, which had broken, and millions of years in the future all the present continents would join together to form a new supercontinent.
    - Wegner did not talk about the movements of the ocean floor and rather he said that the continents drift over the fixed ocean floors in the same way as the ship drifts over the ocean water surface.
    - But, in reality, it is found that both continentals, as well as oceanic crusts, are drifting, and also it has been found that continental crust is not drifting over the oceanic crust.
    - The reasons that he gave for the northward and westward movement of the continent were wrong.

**Wegner's contribution**

- - Wegner was the first scholar about 100 years ago to talk about and give a complete theory about drifting off the continents. 
    - His weaknesses led to further research in understanding how the different crusts of the earth are behaving and this way his work proved to be the foundation in many ways to much later research.

**Reasons are given for movements**

- - Northwards movement - Polar fleeing force (centrifugal effect). ( trying to maximise their distance from centre) 
    - Westward movement - Tidal forces. He said as tides move east to west in oceans, tides drifts continents westwards just like waves can push ships in some directions.

### POST DRIFT THEORIES/ DEVELOPMENTS

**Convection** --- the movement caused within a fluid by the tendency of hotter and therefore less dense material to rise, and colder, denser material to sink under the influence of gravity, which consequently results in transfer of heat.

**Convectional current theory**

- - Given by Arthur Holmes.
    - Convections are created in fluid mediums which can flow when the fluid is heated and because of heating and related expansion, it becomes lighter than the surroundings and hence tends to rise to create vertical rising movements known as convections.
    - When such convections gradually cool down they again tend to sink at some other locations completing the cycle of convection by sinking conventions.
    - As per Arthur Holmes presence of radioactive material in mantle material is the cause for the creation of the convectional cycle in the molten mantle region.
    - These convectional cycles comprise molten material. Hence conventional theory discarded the reasons given by Alfred Wagner for the movement of the continents.

**Mapping of the ocean floor**

- - During WWII many ships sank and sonars were sent, to find such sunken objects.
    - During such sonar-based expeditions, it was realized that the ocean floor had many uneven surfaces and hence they were not as flat and featureless as we thought them to be.
    - Rather there are many formations on the ocean floor.
    - Once we realize so many features were present on the ocean floor, further studies were done and more characteristics of the ocean floor were realized.

**Different features of the ocean floor**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 10.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 11.png>)

- - The first region is the continental margin which is made up of continental shelf(< 1 degree slope), continental slope, continental rise, and also it contains partly the side of the continental margin trench which is towards the continental rise.
    - Continental margin = c shelf + c slope + c rise + deep oceanic trenches
    - Continental shelves are generally around 80 km wide measured from the coast of the continent. (At some coast they can be as wide as 1500 kms)
    - Continental slopes are generally formed 200-300 meters up to around 3000-6000 meters.
    - Oceanic trenches are on an average 3-5 km deep from the ocean floor. These are suddenly deep regions like a long deep cut on the floor of the ocean floor.
    - We have found nearly 57 trenches in all global oceans. The deepest of them is Mariana Trench in which the deepest point is known as challenger deep.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 12.png>)
    - There are two type of continental trenches - continental trenches and deep oceanic trenches.
    - At places where there are no continental margin trenches the abyssal planes directly start after the continental rise.
    - Ridges are also known as seamounts which are on an average 3000-4500 meters tall and mountains with pointed peaks. They rise from the ocean floor but never reach the ocean surface or mean sea level.
    - Islands are like Guyots(flat top) or ridges but they have risen above the mean sea level and hence are small land regions surrounded by oceans.
    - Mid-oceanic ridges are like two parallel mountain chains or ranges divided or separated by large depressions known as the central fault of the mid-oceanic ridges. These central fault regions are generally seen to have continuous low volcanic eruptions.
    - When we see in the world oceans the average height of the mid-oceanic ridges is around 2000-2500 meters and hence they rarely rise above sea level.
    - It has also been observed by studying the ocean floor is that generally around the central fault of mid-oceanic ridges we have volcanic eruptions.
    - The age of the rocks in general on the ocean floor keeps getting older as one moves away from the mid-ocean ridges towards the trenches.
    - The age of the rocks never gets older than 200 million years for the rocks of the ocean floor whereas continental rocks have been found to be as old as more than 3500 million years.
    - The equidistant rocks from the central fault or the crest of the mid-oceanic ridges on both sides of the central floor equidistant rock at a similar age, structure, and chemical composition.
    - Also, it was found that though we expected that the ocean floors would have very old and thick sediments coming from the continents and deposited on the ocean floors.
    - But, in reality, it was found that the sediments are very thin and also never older than 200 million years. This was despite the fact that oceans are as old as 4000 million years.
    - Earthquakes were seen to happen frequently near mid-oceanic ridges where the hypocentres was never very deep and also near the trenches where the hypocentres were generally very deep.
    - All these observations led to a new theory given in 1961 by Harry Hess known as Seafloor spreading theory.

### Seafloor spreading theory

- - At the mid-oceanic ridges, central fault some magma rises to cause a volcanic eruption.
    - This magma is part of a much larger convectional cycle taking place below the oceanic lithosphere.
    - Most of this convection does not erupt and rather it diverges below the oceanic lithosphere.
    - This divergence causes the seafloor to continuously drift away from the central fault region causing the seafloor to spread at the same time as newer magma is also rising and erupting along with the deep depression of the central fault as this volcanic lava gradually cools down it keeps adding new rocky material along the deep depression wall.
    - Hence forming new material for the mid-oceanic ridges while the older material keeps going away from the central fault.
    - Also, as it keeps eroding, the height to mid-oceanic ridges goes on decreasing finally becoming the abyssal plain.
    - This is how newer rocks are formed at mid-oceanic ridges as older rocks keep going away and finally the oldest rocks go down into deep trenches.

- - Seafloor spreading theory as explained by Harry Hess was the first theory to discuss the formation and spreading of the ocean floor in a symmetrical manner over a period of time on either side of the central fault of the MOR, starting from the MOR.
    - This formation and spreading of the seafloor at the MOR are mainly driven by the rising convections in the asthenosphere which cause continuous volcanic eruptions through the central fault hence providing the molten lava needed to solidify and turn into new MOR (the seafloor).
    - The diverging conversion below the oceanic lithosphere also moves the lithosphere away on the two sides of the MOR and hence the spreading.
    - This finally ends in the trenches.
    - This way all the observations of the ocean floor are broadly justified by the seafloor spreading theory.
    - Hence, we can see that the volcanic eruptions at the MOR, newer rocks near the MOR, similar character of rocks at a similar distance on the two sides of the MOR.
    - Older rocks as we go away from the MOR and the oldest rocks at the trenches all these observations are justified now as per seafloor spreading theory.
    - Also, the shallow focus earthquakes along the MOR are also justified by the rising part of the asthenosphere.
    - As well deep-focus earthquakes along the trenches are also justified which are due to the sinking of the oceanic floor back into the asthenosphere.
    - We can also understand that from formation to the destruction of seafloor the total time taken is never more than 200 million years and hence we never get any rocks or sediments older than 200 million years from the ocean floors.
    - Harry Hess also used the regular reversal of the earth's magnetic field as evidence to support the sea-floor spreading theory.
    - Earth's magnetic field reversal is a well-known fact known to take place after every few lakh years.
    - Harry Hess used this phenomenon by stating that on the ocean floor we should find alternate bands of magnetic material which came out with the lava eruptions where these alternating bands could show the reversing of earth's magnetism.
    - The newest band on top of the MOR should show the present time magnetic field direction of the earth. (alternate band of magnetic material on the sea-floor)
    - This was also practically confirmed from the samples from the seafloor.

**Challenges/Weaknesses of sea-floor spreading theory**

- - This theory does not talk much about continent formation and movements. 
    - Do not talk about smaller formations such as ridges, seamounts, Guyot. 

**Contribution** 

- - First theory talking about the formation and talking spreading of the seafloor which was also practically confirmed.

**Conclusion**

- - Still, there was no comprehensive understanding of the continental oceanic and lithospheric formation and movements and many other formations on the continents and the ocean floors.
    - Further newer observations led to the evolution of a newer more comprehensive theory known as the plate tectonic theory in 1967.

### PLATE TECTONIC THEORY

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 13.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 4.jpeg>)

- - It was developed by a team of many scientists, Mackenzie, Parker, Morgan, Wilson - **more comprehensive theory**
    - As mentioned in the diagram the whole of the earth's lithosphere is broken into pieces known as plates tectonic plates.
    - The bigger plates are known as major plates.
    - Bigger plates are 7 in number and the smaller pieces are known as minor plates.
    - There are many minor plates. 
    - —- oceanic plate ( pacific ) and continental plates (all other 6 major plate)  

**Classification of plates based on lithosphere on the given margin (common margin where two plates are meeting) of plates**

- - The most common and most used classification.
    - The edges of the plates are called margins.
    - When plates share the boundaries it is called common margin.
    - There are two type of margins —- diverging margin and converging margin 

**Reasons for the tectonic plate movement**

- - The molten magma rises from the depth and spreads laterally below the crust.
    - While spreading, it moves the overlying plate along with it. The molten magma then sinks back, completing a cyclical motion.
    - The molten magma beneath the lithospheric plates is kept molten from the heat released from the radioactive decay in this region from the residual heat coming from higher depths.
    - Ridge Push is the pushing movement along the mid-oceanic ridge where the magma is able to penetrate the lithosphere and hence, pushes the fractured plate laterally.
    - Slab Pull occurs along the trenches or subduction zones where the underlying plate moves down due to gravity and progressively pulls down the plate.

**3 types of interacting margins**

- - Oceanic-oceanic (O-O).
    - Oceanic-continent (O-C).
    - Continent-continent (C-C).
    - There are two types of convictions causing different plate boundaries, Rising convection, and Sinking convection.
    - Rising convection causes divergence at the margin.
    - Sinking convection causes convergence at the margin.
    - Side by side convection (in the relatively opposite direction) causes transform movement at margins.
    - Under Rising convection and related diverging plates margins we can get all 3 types of plate margins - Oceanic-oceanic, oceanic-continental and continental-continental.
    - Sinking convection and related converging plate margins also all three types of plate margins can be found.
    - The same applies to transform boundaries too.
    - So, in all, we have 9 types of boundaries.

#### _Layers of earth_

- - The lithosphere is the earth’s solid outer crust.
    - It is rich in Silica, hence acidic in nature.
    - It is separated into Continental and Oceanic plates.
    - The Asthenosphere is the part of the Upper Mantle which lies just beneath the lithosphere, rich in Iron, Magnesium, hence basic in nature.
    - Continental and Oceanic plates are situated on the Asthenosphere.
    - Temperature is very high at the Asthenosphere, which makes it partially molten, and fluid enough to flow very slowly under heat convection currents.

**Boundaries**

- - Divergent Boundary - Plates move away from each other to form Mid Oceanic Ridges on the floor and Rift Valleys on the land, among other landforms. Formation of the new lithosphere.
    - Convergent Boundary- Plates collide with each other to form Fold Mountains on land and Trenches on the seafloor. Destruction of the old lithosphere.
    - Transform Boundary - Plates slide past each other. It causes no construction or destruction, only deformation of the existing landform.

**Rift valley**

- - Rift valleys are created when due to faulting and block formation and resultant vertical adjustment of the blocks (1000s of km long) long depressions are created which might be deep by a few kilometres and wide by 30-40 or 100 km.
    - Standing at the lower parts of the rift the vertical high rising sides look like mountains which are the block mountains. 
    - For example, the Rift of Vindhya and Satpura, Vosges, and the black forest at the boundary of France and Germany. 
    - In the rift of which the rhine river flows.
    - If the long rifts are so sloping that water from both sides block mountains flows through the rift it can lead to river formation in the rift or aid the already flowing river.
    - For example, rhine is not formed by rifting but aided by rifting.
    - But, if the rift is not so sloping then the water from the nearby slopes might accumulate at different depressions in the rift leading to the formation of different lakes in the rift.

**Magma**

- - When Blocks between two continental plates are adjusting themselves.
    - They can melt and form magma.
    - There are two types of Magma. ( 1. Rising convection magma (lithosphere melted magma), 2. magma formed due to sinking (asthenosphere rising magma) )
    - Magma from the Asthenosphere- rising from deep inside and Block melted magma- formed by a slight sinking of melting lithosphere.
    - Since the density of the lithosphere is lighter than the density of the asthenosphere, hence Lithospheric magma is less dense than Asthenosphere Magma.
    - The ability of flow (or even viscosity) is not related to density.
    - Asthenosphere magma has more ability to flow.
    - Lithosphere melted magma- more vertical.
    - Asthenosphere rising melted magma- more horizontal.
    - Asthenosphere magma is hotter and mostly in a molten state, so it does not solidify as fast as the lithosphere.
    - New Asthenosphere magma can easily displace the earlier ones.
    - Hence no explosive eruption. Most eruptions of Asthenosphere magma are silent.
    - Lithospheric magma show explosive eruptions because it solidifies fast, hence new magma must displace earlier solidified magma, which will need much force.
    - Lithosphere has more silica.
    - So lithospheric magma will be lighter and more acidic.
    - Lithospheric magma is also called Andesitic magma.
    - The asthenosphere has more iron and magnesium.
    - Asthenosphere magma is darker in colour.
    - Asthenosphere magma- is basic in nature, and called- Basaltic magma.
    - Due to the lighter magma eruption in the rift can lead to volcanically active peaks.
    - For example - Mount Kilimanjaro(Tanzania), Mount logan(Canada), Mount Elgon(Uganda), Mount Longonot(Kenya), Mount Meru(Tanzania).

**Volcanism in Rift Valleys**

- - The East African Rift Zone is the largest seismically active rift system on earth. It includes many active and dormant volcanoes.
    - During the formation of the African rift valley, a lot of faulting occurred. The stress in crustal blocks melted the subsurface lithosphere into magma.
    - This lithospheric magma had a high silica proportion.
    - Due to this faulting, Kilimanjaro lies outside of Rift Valley, though being formed by it.
    - Also, the resultant acidic lithospheric magma caused Kilimanjaro to be a Stratovolcano.
    - Normally divergent boundaries see basaltic magma which makes Shield volcano.

**Oceanic – Oceanic convergence**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 14.png>)

- - In the case of convergence of oceanic plates(at least one of the oceanic plates) always tends to sink into the asthenosphere.
    - On the other hand, during the convergence of continental plates never sink, rather they tend to rise.
    - Due to the sinking of denser oceanic plates, convection will get affected.
    - The first formation is of the oceanic trench.
    - Second Formation - Lithosphere melting magma.
    - This will start cracking the non-sinking plate. The magma will erupt in the process and hence create relatively vertical peaks.
    - This will cause volcanic activity on the ocean floor to create volcanic peaks. This will form Ridges/ Seamounts and Guyots.
    - Ocean-Ocean Convergence on the ocean floor gives Lithospheric melting magma.
    - Ocean-Ocean Divergence on the ocean floor gives the Asthenosphere rising magma.
        - Examples, red sea, and the Gulf of Aden.
    - When the continents further diverge away and simultaneously due to basaltic eruption along with the MOR newer ocean floor is formed, the seafloor spreads further forming bigger oceans.
    - For example, the Indian ocean and the Atlantic ocean.

- - As the denser oceanic plate subducts below the relatively less dense oceanic plate, it leads to the formation of trenches. Thus subducting oceanic plate tends to melt and its lighter silica-rich material tends to rise. Whereas the remaining basaltic dense material tends to sink.
    - The rising lighter magma creates acidic volcanism above the seafloor and leads to relatively vertical formations such as ridges, seamounts, guyots, till they are below sea level. When they rise above sea level, they lead to the formation of islands.
    - These islands are generally volcanically active. Hence they have volcanic peaks.
    - This way nearly parallel to the trenches a whole chain or arc of islands are formed known as island arcs/island chains/Archipelagoes e.g. the Aleutian Islands, Kurile Islands, Japan Islands, and the Philippines, Indonesian Islands also the Andaman Nicobar Islands.

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 5.jpeg>)
    - In a similar way, even the New Zealand and the Caribbean Islands are formed.

**Oceanic-Continental Convergence**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 15.png>)

- - When oceanic-continental convergence starts, then the oceanic plate tends to subduct below the continental plate, forming a trench at the margin of convergence.
    - Simultaneously, the lighter continental plate tends to fold creating a fold mountain chain on the continental crust, parallel to the convergence margin. Hence, such mountains will be near to the coast like the Andes and the Rockies.
    - Due to the subducting oceanic plate, some volcanic activity is also created due to the rising magma below the continental plate. This leads to the formation of some volcanic peaks in the fold mountains.
    - Andes fold mountain is formed due to South American continental plate and Pacific oceanic plate convergence. And there are many volcanically active peaks in the Andes mountain e.g. Cotopaxi(equador, highest active volcano), Aconcagua, Ampato, Misti, Chimborazo, Tolima, Sangay etc.
    - When we look at North America along the Western coast, we find the Rockies mountain, they are also found due to the oceanic, continental convergence. And there are some volcanically active peaks in the Rockies also e.g.. Mt. Saint Helens, Dotsero, etc.
    - In oceanic-continental convergence, the oceanic plate tends to subduct whereas the continental plate tends to fold forming fold mountains. The subducting oceanic plate leads to some volcanic activity in the fold mountains.

**Continental-Continental Convergence**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 16.png>)

- - When we have C-C convergence, neither of the plates subduct. 
    - In very special cases like the Tibetan Plateau region, there might be some doubling/overlapping of the plate and hence forming a tectonic plateau like the Tibetan plateau.
    - But in general, it would only lead to both the plates folding and hence forming fold mountains where they have converged.
    - Hence, starting from divergence where we have C-C divergence where one continent gradually breaks into two continents and over a period forms ocean in between at some place of the earth. But because the earth is spherical hence at some other place the ocean between continents is gradually consumed and the continents converge along the fold mountains to form a bigger continent and this way the breaking and joining of continents and forming and consuming of oceans goes on in a cyclic manner many times. In this process, different formations are made on the oceanic and continental floors as discussed earlier.

**Transform Movement**

- - Divergent plate boundaries are called **Constructive plate boundaries**, and converging plate margins are referred to as **Destructive plate margins**.
    - A transform boundary is neither a constructive nor a destructive boundary. Also called a **Conservative Boundary**.
    - Three types -
    - The **continental-continental transform boundary** just looks like a fault. E.g. San Andreas fault in the USA.
    - Similarly, **Oceanic-oceanic transform faults (boundary)** form only along the MORs where the whole part of the MOR gets fractured into pieces.
    - **Oceanic-continental transform movement** does not take place.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 17.png>)

- - Faulting
        - Normal Fault - Divergent plate boundary
        - Reverse Fault - Convergent plate boundary
        - Strike slip Fault - Transform plate boundary
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 6.jpeg>)

### Intra plate tectonic activities

- - They take place within the plate.
    - **How do they take place?**
        - Magma is involved in interplate tectonic activity.
    - Types of magma
    - 2 types were already covered in the previous class.

- - **Asthenosphere - normal convection magma**
        - This is basic and basaltic.
        - More higher than 7 pH
        - Formation: Relatively more horizontal
        - Leads to the formation of the Abyssal Plain
        - Mid Oceanic Ridge
    - **Lithospheric melted magma -**
        - Formed by melting of lithosphere in convergence boundary (O-O & O-C)
        - It is acidic and andesitic.
        - Less than 7 pH.
        - It leads to formation of strato volcanoes, ridges and seamounts.
    - **Mantle Plume Magma - Less basic.**
        - Slightly more than 7 pH.
        - Relatively less horizontal.
        - They are shield volcano domes.
        - It leads to formation of Fissure Basalt Plateau. They form only on land and not on the ocean floor.
        - Mantle plumes are also known as hot spots.

#### _Hotspots_

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 7.jpeg>)

- - Globally, we have different hotspots of importance such as Galapagos, Hawaiian, Azores, Icelandic hotspot.
    - Icelandic is at the plate margin.
    - Hawaiian island - The plate kept moving due to convection.
    - This led to the formation of the Emperor seamount chain, Midway, Hawaiian Ridge, and Hawaii in a sequence.

**Mantle plume activity over the seafloor**

- - The mantle plume might erupt in the inner parts of the plate away from the margin either over the ocean floor or over the continental crust.
    - Over the ocean floors, the mantle plume leads to the formation of shield volcanoes only and hence forms either seamounts, ridges, or guyots if the formation remains below the sea level, or might form islands also if the formation rises above the sea level.
    - E.g.- the Emperor seamount chain, the Hawaiian ridges, and the different islands such as Hawaiian island, Galapagos, Azores, Reunion, Yellowstone (continental).

- - **What are Mantle plumes?**
    - They are also known as hotspots are formed in the asthenosphere region due to some variation in the density and mineral composition of the material in the asthenosphere.
    - Hence, this material in the asthenosphere does not mix with the rest of the asthenosphere magma and rather it rises as huge bubbles of magma which could fracture the plates and cause volcanic eruption and relatively basaltic eruption known as mantle plume. This might take place either on the ocean floor or over the continental crust.
    - Basalt is a mafic(mg-fe) extrusive igneous rock formed from the rapid cooling of lava rich in magnesium and iron exposed at or very near the surface of a terrestrial planet or a moon. More than 90% of all volcanic rock on Earth is basalt, and the eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year.
    - **Difference between mantle plume island and converging plate islands**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Mantle Plume Island|Converging Plate Island|
|- - - Mantle plumes are in general away from plate margins or trenches.<br>        - Though there are some exceptions also like Iceland (where 2 plates meet)|- - - In the case of the converging plate islands, the islands would always be parallel to as well as near the trenches.|
|- - - Mantle plume islands are newer just above the mantle plume/ hotspots activity regions. They are also volcanically active.|- - - But when we go away from the hotspot activity region. The islands would be older and volcanically inactive having formed and moved away from the hotspot region due to the normal asthenosphere convection, gradually moving the plates.|

**Hotspot activity over the continent crust**

- - When the hotspot activity takes place over the continental crust, it generally leads to the formation of basalt lava plateaus and rarely leads to the formation of shield volcanoes depending upon the particular erupting magma.
    - An example of mantle plume eruption over continental crust is the Deccan Basalt Lava plateau.

- - Around 65 million years before the present, when the Indian subcontinent crust region was moving from south to north, it was located over the reunion hotspot which was active then also.
    - The mantle plume lava eruption over the Indian subcontinent region led to the formation of the Deccan Basalt lava plateau region as the Indian subcontinent moved further north and hence away from the reunion hotspot.
    - The mantle plume eruption stopped over the subcontinent and continued over the oceanic floor region.
    - Gradually, the Indian subcontinent united with the Eurasian subcontinent and at the hotspot region an island was formed known as reunion island.
    - Similar lava plateaus are also formed in other parts of the world such as the Columbia snake Lava plateau in North America. the Patagonia plateau in south America, the Siberian plateau in Russia and also the Mongolian plateau in Mongolia and the Ethiopian plateau from where the Nile river starts in Africa.

### Volcanoes

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 18.png>)

- - The term is derived from the word Volcano which means “flow of lava”.
    - It is below the Earth’s surface in the lithosphere crust is also volcanism which is called as Intrusive volcano. 
    - Once it erupts over the land surface, it is the flow of lava over the land surface. It is called as extrusive.

- - In the region, below the earth surface normally there are layers of sediments forming the crust or lithosphere region.
    - In this region, as the lava flows through, it can move broadly **either near horizontally** between the layers or it can move relatively vertically across the layers.

- - **Horizontal formation:**
        - The simplest one is sills.
        - Others are Laccolith - the large dome-shaped mound which has a level base fed by a pipe
        - Phacolith - lens-shaped 
        - Lopolith - saucer shape
        - Batholith - huge mass of igneous rocks
    - **Vertical formation**
        - Dyke

**Extrusive volcanoes**

- - It is grouped on the basis of the frequency of volcanic activity
    - They are divided into 3 parts
    - Active which have erupted frequently in the recent past.
    - Dormant volcanoes are known to have erupted or shown signs of possible eruption in the future.
    - Extinct volcanoes are volcanic formations, but have not erupted in human history.
    - But this is not a very technical classification rather based on observation.
    - Also, any active volcano can become dormant or extinct volcano can suddenly erupt and become eruptive or can show the signs of eruption but become dormant.
    - The other classification is relatively more scientific as shown below:

**Nature of magma and shape of formation**

- - **Asthenosphere convection and magma volcanoes:**
        - Over ocean floor: Mid oceanic ridges
        - Over the continents : It does not take place over the continent. 
    - **The mantle plume magma volcanoes**
        - They can take place over the both ocean and continents.
        - Over the ocean, it will form a shield volcano that is dome-shaped.
        - Over the continent, mostly, it is a basalt lava plateau.
        - And rarely, it will form, shield volcano domes such as the Mauna Loa and Kilauea dome peaks on the Hawaiian island.

- - **3 type of volcanos -  less acidic, moderate acidic and most acidic**
        - Less acidic — Ash and cinder volcano 
            - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 8.jpeg>)

- - Moderate acidic — Strato volcano - all the major volcanic peaks in the world
    - Most acidic —- caldera cone volcanos (upper part fully blown away during eruption, normally hollow region turns into lake called as crater or caldera)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 9.jpeg>)

**Distribution of volcanoes**

- - Volcanoes are generally found more along the plate margins such as converging and diverging plate boundaries and relatively lesser in the interiors of plates where they are found around the mantle plume region.
    - When we see the global distribution of volcanoes, we find that the margins of the pacific plate contains 2/3rd of the world's volcanoes.
    - It is also known as the pacific ring of fire with more than 250 active volcanoes in the region.
    - The other region known for volcanic activity includes the extension of the circum-pacific belt up to the Andaman Nicobar islands.
    - Active volcanoes are also found in the East African rift valley, Mediterranean sea region as also in the Caribbean islands and some active volcanoes along the mid-Atlantic region.
    - At some places, we also find hot water bodies which are related to underground volcanic regions of the present or past.
    - These regions are known as natural hot water body regions, geysers or hot springs.

### Earthquakes

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 19.png>)

- - Surface waves are created when body waves hit the surface of the earth. 
    - These waves are created like waves on a water surface created due to a stone dropping in water.
    - Surface waves travel only on the surface of the earth. 
    - There are two types of surface waves, the Rayleigh waves and L waves (Love waves).
    - These surface waves are transverse waves where Rayleigh travels like water waves.
    - Whereas love waves travel snake-like, they are the reason for most of the destruction that we see during the earthquake.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 10.jpeg>)

- - Earthquakes are also classified on the basis of the depth of their focus from the epicentre.
    - The focus shallower than 70 km is known as shallow-focus earthquake, which has its effect only up to a narrow region.
    - The second type of earthquake is between 70-300 km, known as inter-mediate earthquakes, they have their effect over a relatively inter-mediate region.
    - Earthquakes with a focus deeper than 300 km are known as deep-focus earthquakes, they affect a relatively much wider region.
    - Earthquakes are created due to seismic activities causing a sudden release of a considerable amount of energy in the earth's interior where the interior rocks surpass their elastic limit releasing considerable seismic energy creating seismic waves causing earthquakes.

**Causes of earthquakes**

- - Earthquakes can because naturally due to tectonic activities such as plate movement, mantle plume activities, volcanic activities, meteorites falling on earth can create huge earthquakes, landslides.
    - Human-induced earthquakes - due to mining activities when hollow regions collapse, groundwater extraction, construction and blasts and related activities, reservoir induced seismicity, nuclear explosion.

**Measurement of seismic activity**

- - We have two types of scales to measure seismic activities.
    - **Intensity-based scale and measured amplitude** were used for calculated magnitude.
    - Intensity-based scale is how strong the earthquake is as we feel it, it is subjective hence not very scientific.
    - **Amplitude based is based on measured shaking of the earth called amplitude, with a machine called a seismograph**.
    - We have magnitude-based scales - Richter and moment-based.
    - We have two intensity-based scales- the Mercalli scale (derived by Mercalli) and Medvedev.
    - The Mercalli scale was the first scale used for measuring earthquakes in 1902 and the scale is divided into twelve scale levels, ranging from level one which is an earthquake not even felt by human beings.
    - The strong earthquakes as per this are from level-6 and extreme earthquakes are from level-12 where level 12 implies total destruction and ground seems to move like a wave and things are up in the air.
    - But, the Mercalli scale has a limitation because it is based on the perception of the people.

**MSK Scale**

- - It is a macro - seismic scale used for giving national-level data of earthquakes dividing the regions into different earthquake-prone zones.
    - For example, the government of India has divided the whole country into four earthquake-prone zones starting from zone- II up to zone- V.
    - Earlier we had a zone-I which was later on merged with zone-II.
    - These 4 zones of India are on the basis of level - 5-6 up to level 9 of the MSK scale.
    - Zone 5 is the most destructive earthquake-prone zone in India.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 11.jpeg>)

**Richter scale**

- - The Richter scale is a more scientific scale.
    - The magnitude is from 1-10.
    - Magnitude is a measure of strength or amount of energy released during an earthquake.
    - Each number increase in magnitude on the scale implies 10 times increase in the amplitude of the earthquake, which also means a nearly 31-32 times energy release increase as the magnitude scales are logarithmic scales.

**Moments Scale**

- - The Richter scale has a limitation in that it is not very accurate in measuring earthquakes of magnitude more than 8 and hence a moment scale is developed for measuring earthquakes of more than 8.
    - The moment scale is based on the total moment released of an earthquake, where the moment is the product of the distance that fault moves due to the earthquake and the energy required to move that distance.

**Earthquake-prone regions in the world**

- - On average, more than 50000 earthquakes happen annually.
    - Nearly, 70% of all earthquakes occur in the circumpacific region.
    - Nearly 20% of earthquakes occur in the Mediterranean Himalayan region from the alps up to the Himalayas and also the mountains in China, north of Tibet.
    - The rest of all the regions on the earth get only the remaining 10% of the earthquake.
    - The most intense earthquake ever measured in the world was in the 1960s in Chile at a place called Valdivia with a magnitude of 9.5.
    - One of the most intense regions in India was in 1934 near the Nepal-Bihar border with 8.4 points.

### Tsunami

- - The word Tsunami has a Japanese origin, meaning harbour waves.
    - But, in reality, the word tsunami is a misnomer because tsunami waves are not harbouring waves and are not created at the harbours but rather are created in deep oceans and open ocean regions.

**Causes tsunami**

- - Tsunami waves can be created on the deep ocean floors due to tectonic activities, can be caused by explosive Volcanoes on the ocean floors, also can be caused by deep water landslides and also by meteorite hits or by a nuclear explosion in the oceans also.
    - For a tsunami wave to be formed an earthquake of magnitude around 6.5 or is required as lower magnitude earthquakes do not cause a tsunami in general.

**How the Tsunami is formed**

- - For tsunamis to form we need a decent magnitude earthquake (magnitude equal to more than 6.5).
    - Such a seismic activity leads to a tremendous amount of sudden release of energy and this released energy travels in the deep ocean as waves gradually move up to the surface of the ocean in the open ocean region.
    - The Tsunami waves on the surface of the ocean in open oceans are very wide one wave from a very little height but very high speed which means very high kinetic energy
    - This is due to the low fiction provided by water.
    - As the waves travel closer to the ocean coast, the ocean depth decreases and the waves start getting friction from shallower water.
    - Hence, the waves speed starts to decrease and the high kinetic energy gradually starts to change into higher potential energy which means the higher height of the waves with lesser speed.
    - Hence, the tsunami wave takes more height near the shallower coast and despite the lower speed, as compared to speed in the open ocean, away from the coast. 
    - Still, the speed on the coast is high enough to flood the whole coast and cause enough damage to humans before they could evacuate the coast.
    - The tsunami wave height near the coast are up to 30 meters high and the wave speeds are up to 50 km per hour.
    - This is why tsunami is so destructive. 
    - When a tsunami is created more than one tsunami wave is created.
    - Every tsunami wave has a low part and a high part.
    - During high tsunami waves, flooding of the coasts generally takes place due to fast-moving waves.
    - Whereas the low waves generally lead to the ocean water receding and hence exposing the coastal continental shelf.
    - People who do not understand this phenomenon might move towards the exposed continental shelf during the low tsunami wave without realising that a following high tsunami wave will succeed the low tsunami wave.
    - Hence, again it will flood the coast, causing damage and loss of life.
    - Hence, during a tsunami, one should not move toward the continental shelf even if the water is receding backwards.

**Tsunami Genesis**

- - Tsunami genesis is the process of formation of tsunamis and normally plate margins in the deep open ocean regions are considered as tsunamigenic regions.
    - Such as the Indonesian tsunamigenic region, tsunamis form can affect India's eastern coast as well as Makran, a tsunamigenic region near Pakistan- Iran border can affect India’s western coast.

## GEOMORPHIC FORCES AND PROCESSES

- - Geomorph means changing the earth surface.
    - Endogenic forces - un-levelling the earth surface.
    - Exogenic forces - levelling the earth surface.
    - Endogenic and exogenic forces together are called geomorphic processes/forces, because they change the earth's surface continuously.

**Types of forces**

- - Sudden catastrophic forces and slow Diastrophic forces.
    - Sudden - earthquakes and volcanoes.
    - Diastrophic - Vertical and horizontal.
        - Vertical forces (Epeirogenic forces)- Uplifting or subsiding . - mainland uplifting - continental building
        - Horizontal forces (orogenic forces) - compressing and tensing. - mountain building through severe folding
        - Earthquakes - involving local minor movements
        - Plate tectonics - horizontal movements of crustal plates.

**Endogenic processes**

- - Diastrophism
    - Volcanism

**Exogenic forces**

- - Energy - solar energy.

- - The process of levelling the region is called gradation.
    - Gradation is achieved by degradation and aggradation.
    - Degradation of uplifted regions.
    - Aggradation of depressed regions.

**How is gradation achieved**

- - Geomorphic processes are of two types exogenic and endogenic.
    - The exogenic geomorphic process is gradation which involves degradation and aggradation which is achieved by denudation.
    - The process of gradation involves 5 sub-processes.
        - Weathering - breaking at the location. (in-situ).
        - Mass movement - Moving broken material down the slope using gravity.
        - Erosion - Breaking of material due to friction is called erosion.
        - Transportation - by agents - (rivers, glaciers winds, waves, ground water)
        - Deposition

Degradation and aggradation is achieved by denudation

### Sub-processes of denudation

##### Weathering

- - Weathering basically means breaking at the site. 
    - Three types of weathering take place in nature.
        - Physical weathering - due to physical processes.
        - Chemical weathering - involves chemical reactions and chemical processes.
        - Biological weathering - involves biological reactions and biological processes.

**Physical weathering**

- - Physical weathering takes place due to - loading or unloading, which means when rocks are loaded by other rocks they break under pressure.
    - Similarly, rocks that were stable under pressure might break down when the overlying rocks are unloaded.
    - Temperature changes and related expansions.
    - Temperature changes may cause expansions and contraction in the rock surfaces.
    - If rock is broken layer by layer it is called exfoliation.
    - Freezing and melting are also called thawing.
    - In thawing the water accumulated in the cracks freezes during very cold temperatures and due to freezing, ice tends to expand and hence it puts pressure on the rocks.
    - Hence by putting pressure like this the rocks gradually break.
    - Salt also on absorbing water swells whereas on drying it contracts.
    - Hence when salts in the rocks tend to become moist, they put pressure on the rocks and break them whereas on drying the pressure reduces.

**Chemical weathering**

- - Chemical weathering involves different chemical reactions which take place with the rocks and gradually break them such as oxidation of rocks, reduction of rocks, solution etc.

**Biological weathering**

- - It involves the actions of plants and animals that break the rock.
    - Decaying of plants in the rocks breaks the rock. 
    - Roots grow in the rocks and break them.
    - Animals decay on the rock, it weathers or breaks the rocks. 
    - Some animals can dig or break rocks.
    - Humans, mine, constructs which contribute to the breaking of the rocks.

##### Mass movement and mass wasting

- - Mass movements (also called mass-wasting) is the down-slope movement of a loose uncemented mixture of soil and rock particles that covers the Earth's surface by the force of gravity without the aid of a transporting medium such as water, ice, or wind. 
    - Types of mass movements- Slow mass movements and rapid mass movements.
        - The slow mass - movements have two parts, soil creep and solifluction.
        - Slow mass movement is the imperceptible slow movement of weathered soil material downslope.

**Slow mass movement**

- - The slow mass movement is generally not perceptible to our eyes and rather we realise that it is taking place only when over a long period the removed material or the accumulated material become the evidence.
    - The slow mass movements are further divided into soil creep which takes place in water unsaturated regions and hence there is no excessive water in the soil.
    - The presence of water lubricates the soil and makes the soil movement easier.
        - Solifluction takes place similar to soil creep with the only major difference being that here the soil is saturated with water and hence has surplus water available.

**Rapid movements**

- - Earth-flow takes place when the soil is moving visibly but the soil is not water-saturated.
    - The soil is held by some vegetation cover.
    - In the case of mud-flow, the soil is relatively saturated with water and the soil movement takes place in the absence of vegetation cover.
    - A huge amount of snow slipping of a slope at a very fast pace is called a snow avalanche.
    - In a debris avalanche, debris means the waste of weathered broken rock material accumulated in the upper parts of hills or mountains.
    - When such a huge amount of debris tends to slip over the hill slope at a relatively fast speed we call it, debris avalanche.
    - It is like a snow avalanche but the snow is replaced by debris.

##### Landslide

- - It takes place when a part of the land on the hill weathers and tends to slip off on a relatively large scale.
    - This normally happens when either due to earthquakes or large explosions such as dynamite explosions or excessive rainfall causing the water to seep deep into the hills.
    - Hence a relatively deeper and bigger part of the slope breaks off.
    - We get a lot of earthquakes and explosions in the Himalayas due to construction and also due to heavy rains in some areas.
    - In the western ghats, though earthquakes do not take place, heavy rainfalls are a major cause of landslides especially in the southern hills like Nilgiris.

##### Transportation and erosion

- - 5 agents of erosion assisted by gravity - Rivers and rains, glaciers, ocean waves, groundwater and winds.

**Type of erosion**

**Corrasion and Abrasion**

- - In this relatively bigger rock parts such as gravel, pebble etc are rubbed in motion by relatively smaller parts such as sand or silt and the bigger parts get broken into smaller parts.
    - This takes place in all types of in all five agents of erosion.

**Attrition**

- - In attrition, similar size rock parts rub against each other while in motion and break into relatively smaller parts.
    - It also takes place in all 5 agents.

**Corrosion**

- - It takes place in water-based mediums, such as fluvial or river water, glacial water, ocean wave movements and groundwater.
    - It does not take place in aeolian erosion, especially when the wind is dry.

**Hydraulic action**

- - It takes place when relatively fast-moving water due to its flow-related pressure tend to break down rocks and their parts.
    - This takes place mostly in ocean waves and river water breaking coastal rocks and rocks in waterfalls.

**Plucking**

- - This takes place only in glacial agents which tends to pluck the rocks and form tills.

**Deflation**

- - Deflation takes place only due to winds.

## Landforms

- - Landform basically means any unique feature on the land which we can see, we call as landforms.
    - The five agents form denudation from their own unique landscapes, which are the pieces of evidence that in a given region which agent is dominantly forming landforms.
    - Groundwater landforms are mostly formed in calcium-rich rock regions because calcium dissolves in water and hence gets eroded and forms different landforms.
    - These calcium-rich regions are also called limestone regions.
    - Such limestone landform regions are also called karst regions.
    - The five agents of denudation are mainly associated with the erosional processes and the depositional processes and hence these five agents of denudation mainly form different landforms either by erosion or by deposition.
    - Hence all the landforms due to exogenic geomorphic processes can broadly be grouped into erosional landforms or depositional landforms due to one of the five agents.

#### _Endogenic geomorphic landforms_

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 21.png>)

#### _Exogenic geomorphic landforms_ 

- - Fluvial (river) Erosional and depositional landforms.
    - Aeolian (wind) Erosional and depositional landforms.
    - Glacial Erosional and depositional landforms.
    - Coastal waves Erosional and depositional landforms.
    - Karts Erosional and depositional landforms.

##### Landforms of fluvial (Riverine) Process

- - Rivers are natural medium or large streams of water flowing on the land surface, carrying water for the most part of the year, if not all part of the year.
    - They generally start from high altitude places such as mountains or plateaus, flowing due to gravity to the lowest place possible which is generally the mean sea level then the river flows into the sea and that location is called the mouth of the river.
    - But, some rivers do not reach up to the ocean and water dries before they reach the ocean such as the Ghaghra river in Haryana or Luni river in Rajasthan. These are called inland drainage rivers.
    - Every river has a course of life generally starting from high elevation regions and ending in the oceans.

**Phases of rivers**

- - Youthful stage - Fast erosion. First phase.
    - Moderate - Both erosion and deposition.
    - Mature stage - Finest silt is found here. More deposition.

**What all materials are carried by the river**

- - When these rivers come to the mature stage they start to deposit first the boulder(big rocks), then the rocks, pebbles(rounded rocks) and gravels(1-2 mm), sand(0.05-1 mm), silt(05-0.005), clay( <.005 mm) — this are the unresolved matters. 
    - Different salts are also present in river water ( very low concentration ) and they are dissolved in water. 
    - Parallel to the foothills of the Himalayas towards to India, Nepal-Bhutan side we find the initial deposits of the Himalayan rivers, namely - boulders, rocks, pebbles and gravels. — This region is known as the Bhabar region. — this is where the river disappears between rocks ( flowing below the rocks on the ground surface ). 
    - The Bhabar will continue up to Assam.
    - Hence this is Not very fertile, and only deep-rooted trees etc grows here.
    - South of the Bhabar region, we find another parallel belt having deposits of sand and silt, it is called the wet or Terai region.
    - The terai region has a width of 10 to 20 km.
    - It continues from Kashmir up to Assam.
    - This is a naturally dense vegetated region as the river reappears over the sandy silty soils.
    - As the tributary rivers continue to flow and meet their main rivers , They tend to deposit some of the silt on their way as also they tend to pass on their remaining silt and clay to the main river.
    - The north-western part where the Indus, Yamuna and Ganga flow, region is relatively higher in altitude.
    - Hence slightly more slowly and hence deposited by the sand and silt of Indus tributaries and Ganga and Yamuna.
    - It is known as the Bhangar region, sandy-silty and coarser soil.
    - The central and eastern part of Ganga and where it meets the Brahmaputra around Assam-Bangladesh.
    - The region is relatively low-lying and hence has finer silt and clay deposits known as the khadar region.
    - This way the Bhabar, Terai, bhangra and khadar together make the north Indian plains stretching from the Jammu Kashmir region up to the Assam region south and parallel to the Himalayas.

**Deltas**

- - A river delta is a landform created by the deposition of sediment that is carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower-moving or stagnant water.
    - This occurs where a river enters an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or another river that cannot carry away the supplied sediment.

Erosional - pools, sinkholes, Lapies, Limestone pavements.

Depositional - stalactites(hangs), stalagmites(rises up) and pillars
