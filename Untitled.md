- **What is geography**: Geography means the description of the earth. It is the study of places and relationships between people and their environment. The term geography was coined by **Eratosthenes** and he is also called as the father of geography.

- **The shape of the earth**: The shape of the earth is called as **Geoid** or **oblate spheroid**. Since it is flattened at poles and bulged at the equator, it is due to the continuous spinning of the earth. This was proposed for the first time by **Newton** who also suggested the same effect for other planets too.

- **Evidence to prove spherical shape of Earth**:
    - **Circumnavigation of earth**- **Magellan** completed the first circumnavigation of the earth in **1519**.
    - **Circular horizon**- The horizon appears circular when viewed from the ship and the horizon widens with an increase in altitude.
    - **The ships' visibility**- when viewed from a distance or from coast ships appear to be rising from water gradually.
    - **Bedford level experiment** is another proof.
    - **Sunrise and sunset** - different times of day and night at different locations is possible only on a spherical body.
    - **Eclipse** - The circular shadow of earth visible during a lunar eclipse.
    - The spherical shape of other planets is also a piece of evidence.

- **Latitudes and Longitudes**:
    - **Latitude** is an angular distance of a point on the earth's surface measured in degrees from the center of the earth towards north & south of the equator.
    - **Parallels** are the imaginary lines connecting places with the same latitude. The largest parallel of latitude is zero degrees and is called the equator. The parallels of latitude are always parallel to the equator and one another. The length of the latitude decreases from equator to pole. The distance between two parallels always remains the same. The distance between one degree of latitude is equal to **111 km** anywhere on the earth.
    - **Longitude** is the angular distance of a place east or west of the prime meridian.
    - **Meridians** are the semi circles running from pole to pole connecting the places with the same longitude. The meridians of longitudes are not parallel to each other and the distance between them decreases towards the pole. The length of the meridian always remains the same. One degree of latitude or longitude is divided into **60 minutes** and **1 minute** is divided into **60 seconds**. The distance between two degrees of longitudes is equal to **111 km** at the equator and it decreases towards the pole.
    - **Great circle** is the longest possible circumference that can be drawn on earth A great circle divides the earth into **2 equal halves**. An infinite number of great circles can be drawn on the surface of the earth. A **Great circle** is used to find the shortest distance between two locations on the surface of the earth.

- **Rotation and Revolution**:
    - **Rotation** is the spinning movement of the earth on its axis. The axis of rotation is the imaginary line passing through poles and the center of the earth around which the earth rotates. The orbital plane is the plane in which the earth orbits around the sun. The angle between the axis of rotation and the orbital plane is **66.5 degrees**. The angle of tilt of the axis of rotation from its normal position is equal to **23.5 degrees**. The direction of rotation is counter clockwise or West to East.
    - **Period of rotation**:
        - **Solar Day**: It is the time taken by the earth to rotate on its axis so that the sun appears in the same position in the sky, the solar day is equal to **24 hours**.
        - **Sidereal day**: It is the time taken for the earth to rotate on its axis so that a distant star appears in the same position in the sky, the sidereal day is equal to **23 hrs 56min**.
        - **Speed of earth's rotation**: The linear speed of rotation of the earth is the maximum at the equator and reduces towards the poles. Therefore, rockets are launched closer to the equator.
        - **The circle of illumination**: It is a circle which divides the regions of day and night on the earth.
    - **Revolution** is the movement of the earth around the sun and Earth revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit. Earth revolves around the sun in a counter clockwise direction.
        - **Perihelion** is the position of earth nearest to the sun (**3rd January**)
        - **Aphelion** is the position of earth farthest from the sun (**July 4th**)
        - The period of the revolution of the earth is **365 days 5 hrs 48 min**.
        - The average speed of the revolution of earth is nearly **1 lakh km/hr**.

- **Seasons**: Seasons are observed on the earth because the earth revolves around the sun with a tilted axis of rotation whose angle of inclination is always constant. The change in seasons on the surface of the earth is mainly due to variation in the length of day and the intensity of sunlight which is dependent on the angle of incidence. The regions receiving higher intensity of sunlight for a longer duration experience higher temperature resulting in summer. Those regions receiving lower intensity of sunlight for shorter duration experience winters.
    - **Summer solstice**: It occurs on **21st June**. **90 degrees** of sunlight at tropic of cancer. The length of the day increases from the equator to the north pole.
    - **Winter solstice**: It occurs on **22 December**. Sun shines vertically at **23.5 degrees** south which is called the tropic of Capricorn. The length of the day increases from the equator to the south pole.
    - **Equinox**: It happens on **21st March** and **23rd September**. The sun shines vertically at the equator. The length of the day is **12 hrs** along all the latitudes. That is equal day and equal night.

- **The extent of day and night**: The northernmost limit of the overhead sun is **23.5 degrees North** and the southernmost limit is **23.5 degrees South**. Every place located between the topics receives overhead sun at least for **2 days** a year. The polar day is experienced in the regions that receive **24 hours** of sunlight. The polar night is experienced in the regions that receive **24 hours** of darkness. The regions receiving **24 hrs** of day increase from just a single position for the north pole to all the regions within the arctic circle when the earth position changes from the spring equinox to the summer solstice. Thus **66.5 degrees** is the extent to which polar day and polar night are experienced.

- **Tabular presentation**:

| Conditions | The angle of incidence(intensity). | Length of the day |
|---|---|---|
| **Case 1**: No rotation. No tilt. No revolution. | 90 degrees at the equator (higher intensity). 0 degrees at the poles (lower intensity). | 24 hrs of day or night. |
| **Case 2**: Rotation is present. No tilt. No revolution. | 90 degrees at the equator (higher intensity). 0 degrees at the poles (lower intensity). | 12 hrs of the day and 12 hrs of the night across all the latitudes. |
| **Case 3**: Rotation is present. Tilt (northern hemisphere towards the sun) is present. No revolution. | 90 degrees at 23.5 degrees north. The intensity is higher in the northern hemisphere than in case 2. In the southern hemisphere lower intensity than case 2. | Equator- 12 hrs of day and night. The length of the day increases toward the northern hemisphere and decreases toward the southern hemisphere. |
| **Case 4**: Rotation, tilt, and revolution all are present. | 90 Degree at 23.5 degrees south. The southern hemisphere has a higher intensity than case 2. The northern hemisphere has a lower intensity than case 2. | Equator- 12 hrs of day and night. Length of the day increases in the southern hemisphere and decreases in the northern hemisphere. |

- **Time zones**: A time zone is a region of the globe that observes uniform standard time. The entire globe is divided into **24-time zones** with the **Greenwich meridian** as a standard reference. From the **Greenwich meridian** time increases from the east (**EGA**- east gain addition) and decreases towards the west (**WLS**-west lose subtraction). There are **24-time zones** with an interval of **1 hour**. Overall **360-degree longitude** is divided into **24 hours**, thus for every **15 degrees longitude** the time changes by **1 hour**. India follows **82.5 degrees east** as **Indian standard time**. The idea of time zone is the purpose of synchronization of time across the world. **France** has a maximum number of time zones (**12**) due to overseas territories. **Russia** has **11-time zones**.

- **Why there is a demand for multiple time zones in India**: There is a huge geographical distance between the Easternmost and westernmost ends of India. For a person in **Arunachal** sunrise is two hours earlier than the Westernmost part in **Gujarat**. It causes too much of variations in the work times. Mismatch of sun cycle in daily activities. There is huge wastage of power or electricity also.

- **But the demand has not been fulfilled because**: If there are separate time zones, it will cause trouble in the economic integration of the country. It may cause trouble in critical services like transportation & railways, banking, stock exchanges, security & communications, etc. Although locally at some places in Eastern India they follow the **Chai Bagan** time. unofficially. **Indian Standard Time**(**IST**) was started in **1906**. before that, India followed three-time zones of **Calcutta**, **Madras**, and **Bombay** presidencies.

- **International Date Line**(**IDL**): It is an imaginary line of demarcation on the Earth running from north to south poles and demarcates change of calendar date. This line was agreed upon in **1884** that **180 (west or east) degrees longitude** represents **IDL**. **IDL** is not a straight line and follows a zig-zag path to accommodate the islands in the **Pacific Ocean**. If a person crosses **IDL** from west to east he/she gains a day. If a person crosses **IDL** from east to west he/she loses a day.

- **Daylight Saving Time**(**DST**): Daylight saving time is a practice of shifting the time by one hour ahead by forwarding time in the clock during summers. It is done to conserve energy and utilize most of the daylight. Tropical or sub-tropical countries generally don't need **DST** as they don't see much difference in the length of day from winters to summers.

## Space
- **Universe**: It is a limitless expanse of space surrounding us consisting of the solar system, stars, galaxies, dark matter, dark energy, etc. The universe has around **100 to 400 Billion galaxies**. Each galaxy contains **100 to 400 Billion Stars**. And those stars have multiple planets revolving around them.

- **The origin of Universe**: There have been many attempts to explain the origin of the universe including religions.
    1. **Steady-State Theory**: By **Fred Hoyle**. It says the overall size and mass of the universe always remain constant at any point in time. The universe has no beginning and no end and it is always expanding creating new stars and galaxies at the rate the old ones become unobservable.
    2. **Pulsating Theory**: By **Arthur Eddington**. It says that the universe expands and contracts alternatively. It expands because of the explosion and contracts because of the gravitational pull. The universe is currently in the phase of expansion.
    3. **Big Bang Theory**: It was proposed by **Georges Lemaitre** in **1927**. As per the theory, the universe was once extremely compact, dense, and hot singularity. There was no other matter, no space existed, and no time too. **13.7 billion years ago** a cosmic explosion happened called as **Big Bang**. From that time the universe started to expand and continues today. The explosion subsequently created the forces of physics including gravity, elementary particle, atoms, molecules, gaseous clouds, stars, galaxies, etc. In **1929 Hubble** proposed that all observable stars and galaxies are moving away from the earth which he discovered through the **Red Shift**. The rate of expansion is called **The Hubble's Constant**.

- **The Life Cycle of a Star**:
    1. **Stellar Nebula**: It is a giant cloud of gas & dust. The hydrogen gas is pulled together by gravity and the entire nebula starts to spin because of the pull.
    2. **Proto star**: When the spinning gaseous cloud reaches high temperatures, it results in the formation of a hot core and this body is called a proto star. When the temperature of the core cross **15 million degrees Celsius** nuclear fusion reaction begins at the core resulting in the birth of a star.
    3. **Red Giant**: When the supply of Hydrogen runs out, the core of the star contracts and simultaneously the outer shell expands resulting in a large-sized body called a red giant. If the mass of the star is less than **10 times** the mass of the Sun the core collapses and leads to the formation of a planetary nebula which is a spherical shell of gases with a white core. After a sufficient period of time, only the core is left which is a dense body emitting a faint white light called the **White Dwarf**. A **white Dwarf** is theorized to become a **black Dwarf**.
    4. **Red Super Giant**: If the mass of a star is more than **10 times** of the sun, the massive star results in the formation of a **Red Supergiant**.
    5. **Supernova Explosion**: **Red Supergiant** when exhausts its fuel, the leftover body explodes, resulting in a **Supernova explosion**. It is one of the brightest events in the sky. Which releases light equal to the light of a Galaxy during the explosion.
    6. **Neutron Star**: If the remaining core after the explosion is between **1.4 to 3 times** the mass of the sun, it results in a neutron star. **Neutron Star** is a very high-density body composed of closely packed neutrons.
    7. **Black Hole**: If the remnant core after an explosion is more than **3 times** the mass of the sun, the core collapses under gravity resulting in the formation of a **Black Hole**(**M87**). At the core of **Black Hole**, there exists a singularity with infinite gravity and density.

- **Galaxies**: The system contains a group of stars, dark matter, dark energy, gaseous clouds, etc. Galaxy is a sprawling system of gas, dust, matter stars, and other bodies held together by gravity. All galaxies contain a supermassive black hole at their center. **Milky Way** has **Sagittarius Black Hole** at its center.

- **Types of Galaxies**:
    1. **Spiral galaxies**: with spiral arms and a relatively flat disc with a central bulge, when viewed from the side: It appears like a disc with a bulge at the center. Our **Milky Way Galaxy** is a **Spiral Galaxy** and sun is at **Orion arms**. The nearest star near sun is **Proxima Centauri star**: **4.3 Light years**. The nearest Galaxy is the **Andromeda Galaxy**. **Sirius** is the brightest star in the sky: **8.6 light-years**.
    2. **Elliptical Galaxy**: This is an ellipsoidal shape. Spherical or over shape with stars distributed uniformly throughout.
    3. **Irregular Galaxy**: They do not have a fixed shape.

- **Twinkling of Stars**: The twinkling of stars is due to turbulence in the atmosphere. Light from stars gets deflected more as it comes from a point source. The light from planets will not undergo much deflection, therefore planets do not twinkle. Twinkling is not observed in space.

- **Light year**: A light-year is a distance travelled by the light in one year at the speed of **3x10^8 m/sec**. **8.3 minutes** is the time taken by Sun's light to reach earth.

- **Constellation**: Group of stars with a recognizable pattern in the sky. For example, **Big Dipper**, **Orion**, etc.

- **Pole Star**: Star which is aligned with the axis of rotation of the earth, is called a **Pole Star**. Along with the **North Pole**: **Polaris** is the **Northern Pole Star**. Along with the **South Pole**, we have, **Sigma Octantis**. A pole star is always fixed in the sky. However, the angle at which, the pole star is visible, varies with latitude.

- **Solar System**:
    - **Evolutionary theories**: According to evolutionary theories, the material of the solar system condensed into the sun, and simultaneously planets originated as isolated masses of matter, from a single mass of gas. Therefore, both the sun and the planets are of the same age.
    - **Gaseous hypothesis**: It was proposed by **Immanuel Kant**. As per this hypothesis, there were pre-existing supernaturally created hard and cold particles in the form of gaseous clouds. The particles collide with each other due to gravitational attraction releasing heat and gradually forming a rotating structure. From the rotating structure, rings of matter were thrown off, which cooled down to form planets.
    - **Nebular hypothesis**: It was proposed by **Laplace**. A pre-existing nebula was there in a rotating state. With gradual cooling, nebula shrank and led to faster spinning and started to heat up. Gradually, it resulted in the formation of a flat disc. Rings of matter got separated from this disc due to centrifugal force, and this matter condensed to form planets.
    - **Catastrophic theories**: They are also called binary theories.
        1. **Planetesimal Hypothesis**: Proposed by: **Chamberlain** and **Moulton**. The proto-star was accompanied by a companion star. A companion star came near proto-star, gravitational pull led to the ejection of matter from proto-star. The matter gradually condensed, to form planetesimals, which are proto-planets. Planetesimals gradually evolved into planets.
        2. **Tidal hypothesis**: Proposed by **Jeans** and **Jeffreys**. The theory proposes an intruding massive star that came near to the sun. The gravitational pull led to the ejection of tides of matter from the sun. Gradually this matter condensed to form planets.

- **Sun's Layers**:
    1. **Core**: It is the innermost layer of the Sun's interior with very high temperatures of **15 million degrees Celsius**. Nuclear fusion reaction releases energy from the core.
    2. **Radiative Zone**: The energy from the core is carried outward, by radiation through this zone.
    3. **Convective Zone**: Convective currents of photons release energy to the surface, from this zone.
    4. **Photosphere**: It is the lowermost layer of the sun's atmosphere. Visible light originates from here. It is the brightest layer. The temperature is nearly **5,500 degrees**.
    5. **Chromosphere**: It is the intermediate zone of the sun's atmosphere, which appears like a red rim during the solar eclipse.
    6. **Corona**: Outermost layer of atmosphere of the sun. Only visible during the solar eclipse, it is hotter than the photosphere and has a temperature of nearly **2 million degrees Celsius**.

- **Solar Flare**: The sudden outburst of a hot storm of gases and magnetic energy released into space is called solar flares.
- **Sun Spots**: These are the dark portions of the photosphere, which is visible with reduced temperatures of nearly **3,800 degrees Celsius**, but with strong magnetic activity.
- **Sun Spot Cycle**: The number of sunspot on the surface increase or decreases over a period of **11 years**.
    - India is also planning to send **Probe Aditya L1**, to study sunspots.
    - **Solar Maxima** is when the number of sunspots are higher.
    - **Solar Minima** is when the number of sunspots are lower.
    - The last solar maximum happened in **2014**.
    - The last solar minimum happened in **2019-20**.
    - The next solar maxima will happen in the year **2025**.

- **Planets of the Solar System**:
    1. **Mercury**: **Mercury** has no atmosphere of its own, as solar winds are very strong. **Mercury** is the smallest planet.
    2. **Venus**: It is called **Earth's twin**, they are very similar in mass, density, etc.
        - **Venus** is also the hottest planet in the solar system. It is because of the high amount of **CO2**, a greenhouse gas, hence **Venus** is the hottest planet. **Venus** is also the brightest planet. Recently there were reports that **Phosphine gas** was found, which is a bioindicator. This means, the presence of phosphine may be an indication of life at that place.
    3. **Earth**: **Earth** is called a blue planet because it appears blue in the sky. **Earth** is also the densest planet in the solar system.
    4. **Mars**: **Mars** is also called the red planet. **Mars** is smaller but is not as hot as **Venus**, etc. Both **Mars** and **Earth** fall in the **Goldilocks Zone**.
        - **Goldilocks Zone** has a temperature in which water can exist in liquid form.
    5. **Jupiter**: It is the largest planet in the solar system. It is **11 times** bigger than earth. The ‘**Giant Red Spot**’ is the huge spinning storm that is the most visible characteristic of **Jupiter**.
    6. **Saturn**: The most spectacular thing about **Saturn** is its rings. Rings are formed because the matter is very near to **Saturn**. It is the lightest planet in the solar system. It is lighter than the density of water.
    7. **Uranus**: The Axis of rotation of **Uranus** is **98 degrees**. It appears like rolling in its orbit. **Uranus** has a retrograde rotation.
    8. **Neptune**: Only planet not visible to naked eye. Farthest planet in the solar system. A little bit smaller than **Uranus**.
    - **Astronomical Unit**: Distance between earth and sun is called as **1 Astronomical Unit**.
    - **Oort Cloud**: The outermost limit of the solar system. Located at **50,000 AU**.

- **Satellites**: Bodies that revolve around planets.
    - Both **Mercury** and **Venus** have no satellites.
    - **Moon** is the only natural satellite of the Earth.
    - **Mars** has **Phobos** and **Deimos**.
    - **Jupiter**: It has around **79 satellites**: **Io**, **Europa**, **Ganymede**, and **Calisto** are the four satellites of **Jupiter** discovered by **Galileo**. **Ganymede** is the largest satellite of the solar system.
    - **Saturn**: Till recently the highest number of satellites have been observed with **Saturn**. **Titan** is the largest satellite of **Saturn** and is the second-largest satellite. **Titan** has its own atmosphere.
    - **Uranus**: **Miranda**, **Oberon**, etc. are the satellites of
    - **Neptune**: has **Triton**, the largest satellite of **Neptune**.
    - **Pluto**: **Pluto** has a satellite called **Charon**. It is as big as **Pluto** itself. It is called as the twin of **Pluto**.

- **Three conditions to be called a planet**: In **2006**, **International Astronomical Union** set the following conditions, for a body to be declared a planet: An independent orbit around sun, enough mass to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. spherical shape. It should have a cleared neighbourhood, i.e. no major body of comparable size in its close vicinity.

- **Milankovitch Cycles**: It is the cyclical movement of Earth; the precision of earth varies.

- **Earth's Natural Satellite** (**Moon**): The moon has a revolution period of **27.3 days**. **Moon** also rotates on its axis in **27.3 days**, hence only one side of moon is visible to us. Therefore, the other half of moon is not visible from earth.

- **Asteroid Belt**: Big rocks which did not form planets. Some of them are very big. When an asteroid comes in close vicinity of Earth, it becomes a meteoroid. When it enters the atmosphere of the earth, and burn, they are called a meteor. When it survives and hits the earth's surface, it is called a meteorite.
    - **Asteroid**: These are small rocky and metallic objects, which orbit the sun between **Mars** and **Jupiter**.
    - **Meteoroid**: When asteroids come out of their belt and move near to earth.
    - **Meteor**: A meteor is a flash of light produced due to the burning of a meteoroid in the earth's atmosphere, it is also called a shooting star.
    - **Meteorite**: The remnant of a meteoroid that reaches the earth's surface, after surviving its passage through the earth's atmosphere is called as **Meteorite**.

- **Kuiper Belt**: The remnants of planets with frozen gases, rocks, and debris material along the outer zone of the solar system form a belt called as **Kuiper Belt** and **Oort Cloud**. **Comets** originate from this zone.
- **Comets**: **Comets** are frozen rocky and metallic bodies surrounded by gases and dust. They develop a very elongated orbit along the sun with a tail always pointed away from it. For example, **Comet Neowise**, **Comet Hale Bopp**, **Haley's Comet** (comet comes back every **76 years**).

- **Eclipse**: An eclipse takes place when one heavenly body moves into the shadow of another.
    1. **Solar eclipse**: When the moon blocks the light of the Sun from reaching the earth, it casts a shadow onto the earth.
        - **Umbra** is the darker shadow where the entire light is blocked.
        - **Penumbra** is a lighter shadow where only a part of the light is blocked.
    - **Types of solar eclipse**:
        - **Total solar eclipse**: It is when the sun is completely blocked by the moon. It is visible only from the regions of the umbra.
        - **Partial solar eclipse**: It is when the sun is partially blocked. It is visible from the penumbra.
        - **Annular solar eclipse**: When the moon is furthest from the earth that is in apogee. It will not be able to block the entire sun and it creates a ring called the ring of fire.
    - **Lunar eclipse**: When the earth comes in between the sun and the moon blocking the light from the sun which was supposed to be reflected by the moon. It causes the earth's shadow to fall onto the moon.
    2. **Lunar eclipse**: Lunar eclipses occur at the full moon phase. When Earth is positioned precisely between the Moon and Sun.
    - **Type of lunar eclipse**:
        - **Total lunar eclipse**: When the moon is completely shadowed. Only the light from the earth's atmosphere reaches the moon making it red therefore it is called a **Blood Moon**. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon is located in the **Umbra** of the earth.
        - **Partial lunar eclipse**: When the moon is located between the **Umbra** and **Penumbra** it results in a partial lunar eclipse.
        - **Penumbral lunar eclipse**: When the moon is completely located in the penumbra, it appears darker than the normal full moon which is called a **Penumbral lunar eclipse**.
    - **Various types of the moon**:
        - **Blood Moon**: A total lunar eclipse is sometimes called a **Blood Moon**, because of the reddish tinge the Full Moon takes on when fully eclipsed.
        - **Super moon**: It is when the moon is very close to earth(**perigee**) and is also a full moon.
        - **Blue moon**: It is the second full moon of the month.

(image of Solar Eclipse)
- **The difference between the solar eclipse and the lunar eclipse**: The solar eclipse happens during a new moon while the lunar eclipse happens during a full moon. The lunar eclipse is longer in duration as compared to the solar eclipse. A solar eclipse can happen during the daytime and a lunar eclipse can happen only in the night-time. You should not see the solar eclipse directly as it can damage the pupil of the eye due to sudden change of sunlight as solar eclipse lasts for a very short duration while it is okay to see the lunar eclipse directly.

## Geomorphology
- It is the study of the physical features of the earth and the process in which those features are formed.
    - Origin and evolution of earth.
    - Geological time scale.
    - Interior of the earth.
    - Earth movement.
    - Continental drift theory.
    - Sea floor spreading Theory.
    - Plate Tectonic.
    - Volcanism.
    - Geomagnetism.
    - Earthquakes.
    - Tsunami.
    - Exogenic movement.
    - Land form.

- **Evolution of earth**: The planet earth was initially barren, rocky, and hot. It had a thin atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. It was in a volatile state during this primordial stage.

- **Formation of inner-layers of the earth**: Due to a gradual increase in density, the temperature of the earth's interior started to increase. This led to density separation causing heavy materials to sink towards the center of the earth and lighter ones moved towards the surface. With time the earth cooled further and gradually condensed into a smaller size. The further process of differentiation led to the evolution of different layers in the earth's interior.

- **Formation of atmosphere and hydrosphere**: Earth's atmosphere was formed in the following stages: The early thin atmosphere with hydrogen and helium was stripped of due to solar winds. During the cooling of the earth gasses and water vapor were released from the interior and the process through which these gases outpoured from the interior is called degassing. The volcanic eruption released more gasses and water vapor. Important gases at this point are carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, water vapor, and every little oxygen. As the earth cooled the water vapor started to condense and the **CO2** in the atmosphere got dissolved in rainwater which further reduced the temperature. This led to more condensation and more precipitation. The rainfall water got collected in the depressions on the earth's surface forming oceans which were completed around **4000 million years ago**. Life began to evolve in the form of **Non-photosynthesis** organisms by **3800-3700 million years ago**. Between **3000-2000 million years ago**, blue-green algae emerged in ocean water which started to release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. By **2000 million years ago** ocean was saturated with oxygen and oxygen started flooding the atmosphere and a new atmosphere emerged.

- **Geological timescale**: It is the time scale of earth. Ocean and continent were forming. It was the first era up to **4000 million years ago**.
    - **Archean eon**: Blue-green algae evolved. Up to **2500 million years ago**.
    - **Proterozoic eon**: The blue-green algae started to evolve into multiple organisms. The conditions started to become more favourable for life. Life was still in the oceans only. A very primitive form of life existed.
    - **Phanerozoic eon**: It is divided into **3 different eras**:
        - **Palaeozoic era**: It means old life. It includes periods **Permian** (domination of reptile), **Carboniferous**, **Devonian**, **Silurian** (**1st plant**), **Ordovician** (**1st fish**), and **Cambrian**.
        - **Mesozoic era**: It means medium life. This era includes the **Triassic**, **Jurassic**, and **Cretaceous Periods**.
        - **Cenozoic era**: The **Cenozoic** is divided into three periods: the **Paleogene**, **Neogene**, and **Quaternary** (the period of homo-sapiens). Each eon (**1000 million years**) dividend onto era. Each era (**200-250 million years**) is divided into periods. Each period (**50-60 million years**) is dived into **Epoch**. Each **Epoch** (**10-20 million years**) is divided into age. Each age is of **4000 years**.
        - **Holocene epoch**: We are currently in the **Holocene epoch**.
        - **Ages of Holocene**: The **1st age** is called **Greenlandian** (**7800-11700 years ago**). **8200-4200 years ago**, is called as **Northgrippean age**. **4200 years-Present** is the **Meghalayan age**.
        - In **Mawmluh cave** in **Meghalaya**, evidence of change of age was found thus the name of **Meghalayan age**.

- **The interior of the earth**:
    - **The sources of study of earth's interior**:
        1. **Direct sources**: We directly get access to the interior of the earth's material. Deep ocean drilling provided access to the martial from the earth's interior. Volcanic eruptions result in the eruption of magma from the earth's interior.
        2. **Indirect sources**:
            - **Density studies**: It is by analysing the average density of earth and its comparison to density as surface and the core.
            - The average density of the earth is **5.5 gm/cm3**.
            - The density near to surface is **2.7-3 gm/cm3** so that means that the deeper part has a higher density. Near to core, the density is **13 gm/cm3**.
            - **Seismic study**: The earthquake waves are released from the interior of the earth. It is by analysing different earthquake waves, their speed, and direction as they travel through different layers of the earth's interior.
            - **Temperature and pressure**: The temperature near to surface rises at the rate of **1-degree Celsius** for every **32 meters**. However, this rate of increase of temperature decreased with depth due to pressure. As we move into the deeper parts of the earth the pressure increases and the rate of increase of the temperature decreases. As with an increase in pressure the melting point of rocks will also increase.
            - **Meteorite**: These are remnants of the of other planets by studying mineralogy and the other property of meteorites we can understand the nature of the earth's interior.

    - **The chemical divisions of the earth's interior**:
        1. **Crust**: It is the outermost layer of the earth's interior made up of light elements. It is cold, hard, and rigid. Just **4 %** of the earth's volume is covered by the crust. It is divided into **2 types** that are continental crust and oceanic crust.
        (image of Structure of the Earth)
    - **The difference between the continental crust and oceanic crust**:

| Continental crust: | Oceanic crust: |
|---|---|
| Very thick (**35-60 km**) | Very thin (**8-10 km**) |
| Rocks are lighter in density (**2.7gm/cm3**) | Rocks are heavier in density (**3 gm/cm3**) |
| Rocks of brighter in colour | Rocks of darker in colour |
| Rocks are older | Rocks are younger |
| It is richer in Aluminium, sodium, and potassium elements (**SiAl layer**) | It is richer in Magnesium, Calcium, Iron (**SiMa layer**) |

    2. **Mantle**: It is a solid layer divided into the upper and lower mantle. The overall depth of the mantle extends to **2888 km**. It consists of **68%** of the mass of the earth. It accounts for **83%** volume of the earth. It is lighter than the core and denser than the crust.
    3. **Core**: It is the innermost layer of the earth. It is majorly made up of nickel and iron (**NiFe layer**). The density is very high that is almost double that of the mantle. The core is divided into the inner and outer core. The inner core is solid and the outer core is liquid due to high pressure in the inner core that increases the melting point of rocks.

- **Physical division of the interior of the earth**:
    1. **Lithosphere**: It is a solid layer made up of **Crust** and the upper part of the **Upper Mantle**. It is hard and rigid. It extends up to the depth of **100 Km**.
    2. **Asthenosphere**: It extends between **100-400 km** in depth. It is plastic in nature that can undergo deformation under pressure. It is also called a low-velocity zone due to the slowing down of earthquake waves in this zone. It is also a source of magma to the surface.
    3. **Mesosphere**: It includes the rest of **Mantle** below **Asthenosphere**.
    4. **Barry sphere**: It includes both the outer and inner core.

- **Element Composition of the entire earth**:
    - Iron: **35%**
    - oxygen: **30%**
    - Silicon- **15%**
    - Magnesium: **13%**

- **Major Elements of the Earth's Crust**:
    - Oxygen: **46.60%**
    - Silicon: **27.72%**
    - Aluminium: **8.13%**
    - Iron: **5%**.

- **Discontinuity within the interior of the earth**:
    - It is the transition zone between the different layers of the earth's interior with different physical and chemical characteristics.
    - There are mainly **5 types of discontinuities**:
        - **Conrad Discontinuity**: It is within the **Crust** (**Upper** and **Lower Crust**).
        - **Mohorovicic** or **Moho Discontinuity**: It is Between **Crust** and the **Mantle**.
        - **Repetti Discontinuity**: It is Between the **Upper** and the **Lower Mantle**.
        - **Guttenberg Discontinuity**: It is Between **Mantle** and **Outer Core**.
        - **Lehmann Discontinuity**: It is Between the **Outer** and **Inner Core**.

- **Diagrammatic representation of discontinuities**:
(image of discontinuities in earth's layers)
    - **Rocks**: Any naturally occurring agglomeration of mineral particles from rocks

- **Difference Between Rocks and Minerals**

| Rocks | Minerals |
|---|---|
| Rocks are an aggregate of mineral elements. | Minerals are solid inorganic substances occurring naturally. |
| A rock has no definite chemical composition | Minerals have a definite chemical composition. |
| Minerals are organized to form rocks. | Elements are organized to form compounds that are known as minerals. An element is a pure substance. |
| The three chief types of rocks are- Igneous, Sedimentary, and metamorphic. | Four chief mineral groups are- Silicates, Carbonates, Sulphides, and metallic minerals. |
| Basalt, Granite, Sandstone, Slate, and Quartz are some important types of rocks. | Iron, Silicon, Magnesium, Nickel, Calcium, are abundant minerals of the earth. |

- **Types of rocks**:
    1. **Igneous rocks**: They are primary rocks formed due to cooling, solidification, and crystallization of molten material of magma.
        - **Igneous rocks are of two types**:
            - **Intrusive igneous rocks**: They are formed from the cooling of magma inside the earth. Examples are granite, Gabbro, etc.
            - **Extrusive igneous rocks**: They are formed due to the cooling of magma above the earth's surface. Examples are Basalt, Andesite, etc.
        - **Igneous rocks are also being classified as**:
            - **Acidic** or **Silicic**: Where the silica percentage is more than **66%**. For example, **Granite**.
            - **Basic** or **Mafic**: Where the silica percentage is less than **52%**. For example, **Basalt** or **gabbro**.
        - The rate of cooling of magma decides the texture of igneous rock. Fast cooling results in glassy texture with lower strength for example basalt. Slow cooling results in crystalline texture with higher strength for example granite.
    2. **Sedimentary rocks**: These are the secondary rocks formed by the solidification of sediments of original igneous or metamorphic rocks or another sedimentary rock.
        - **Stages in the formation of sedimentary rock**:
            - **Weathering**>>**Transportation**>>**Deposition**>>**Lithification** (turning of loose sediments into hard rock)>>**Compaction** (sediments are squeezed by the weight of overlying layers)>>**Cementation** (It involves binding together of compacted sediments by natural cementing material). **Sedimentary rocks** are formed by the deposition of sediments in different layers or strata. Therefore, sedimentary rocks contain different layers. Sedimentary rocks also contain various fossil evidence. Examples of sedimentary rocks are **Sandstone**, **Limestone**, **Clay**, **Chalk**, **Coal**, and **Gypsum**.
    3. **Metamorphic rocks**: **Metamorphism** involves changes in the form of rocks through physical or chemical processes. The change in pressure conditions results in dynamic metamorphism and the change in temperature results in thermal metamorphism.
        - **Foliation**: **Metamorphism** involves foliation which is the minerals arranged in a series of bands along a plain.
        - **Lineation**: When minerals are arranged linearly.
        - **Examples of Metamorphic rocks**: **Granite** resulting in **Gneiss**, **Sandstone** resulting in **Quartzite**, **Limestone** resulting in **Marble**, **Coal** results in **Diamond**, **Clay** resulting in **Slate**, **Shale** resulting in **Schist**.

- **The Rock Cycle**:
    - In nature, all the rocks get converted into each other form. The outcrop is the elevated part of the surface thus it undergoes weathering very easily.
(image of The Rock Cycle)

- **Movements of the earth**:
    - **Geomorphic processes**: The surface relief or topography results from **2 types** of forces, **Endogenic** and **exogenic**. Both these forces cause physical stress and chemical action on the earth's material, bringing about changes in the configuration of the surface of the earth called as **Geomorphic process**.
        - **Endogenic force**: **Endogenic forces** originate from the earth's interior causing major structural changes on the earth's surface such as land upliftment, subsidence, folding, faulting, etc. They are responsible for the formation of primary topological features like mountains, etc. The sources of energy for **endogenic forces** are primordial heat and radioactivity.
        - **Exogenic forces**: These forces are originated above the earth's surface. They give rise to weathering, erosion, and smoothing of major relief features. They produce minor topographical features, for example, valleys, caves, waterfalls, etc. The sources of energy for **endogenic forces** are sunlight and gravity. The agents of **exogenic movements** are wind, water, glacier, etc.

- **Types of Endogenic movements**:
    - **Sudden Movement**: These are **endogenic movements** shorter in duration and are unpredictable. For example, earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions.
    - **Diastrophic Movements**: These movements operate very slowly, but continuously.
    - These movements move, elevate or build up portions of the earth's crust resulting in the formation of primary landforms.
    - **Diastrophic movements are of 3 types**:
        - **Tectonic movement**.
        - **Isostatic movement**.
        - **Eustatic movement**.
        - **Tectonic movements**: The word 'tectonic' means" to build". These are continent and mountain building movements affecting the earth's surface. It includes **Epierogenic** and **Orogenic movements**.
            - **Epierogenic movements**: These are the vertical movements caused by radial forces and characterized by large-scale upliftment or subsidence of land areas. They are very slow and widespread. These movements lead to a continental building. Examples are slow subsidence of the northern coast of the **Gulf of Mexico**, upliftment of the **Deccan Plateau**.
            - **Orogenic movements**: These are the mountain-building movements caused by tangential forces. They involve intense folding, thrusting, and faulting of narrow belts.
            - **Orogenic movements are of two types compressional and Tensional**.
                - **Folding**: **Compressional forces** cause the earth's rocks to push or squeeze against each other causing the formation of folds. Folds are the structures in which the layers are bent or distorted without the loss of continuity.
                - **Faulting**: **Tensional forces** pull the rocks apart and cause the formation of faults. Faults are the fractures by which the primary surfaces are broken and displaced resulting in the loss of continuity.

- **Folds and faults**:
    - **Folds**: The sides of a fold are called limbs. The upfolds are called anticlines which are formed when the strata are bent upwards. Downfolds are called synclines where the strata are bent downwards.
    - **Types of Folds**:
        - **Symmetrical Fold**: If the limbs of a fold are inclined at the same angle.
        - **Asymmetric Fold**: If one of the limbs is inclined more than the other.
        - **Overfold**: It is a fold where the strata in one limb have been folded beyond the vertical axis.
        - **Recumbent Fold**: It is a fold lying down resulting from the continuation of pressure on one of the limbs.
        - **Nappe**: It is formed when the pressure exerted upon a **Recumbent Fold** is sufficiently great to cause it to be torn from its roots and thrust forward. **Nappes** are well developed in the **Himalayas**.
    - **Types Faults**:
        - In a block, the down-dropped portion of a fault is called **Graben** or **Rift**.
        - The up-thrust block is called **Horst**.
(image of Reverse fault, Normal fault, Strike-slip fault)
        - **Normal Fault**: When one of the blocks moves downward relative to the other it is called **Normal fault** or **Dip Slip Fault**.
        - **Reverse Fault**: When one block moves up about the other one it is called a **Reverse Fault** or **Thrust Fault**.
        - **Strike-Slip Fault**: Where both the blocks move across each other involving no vertical movements or **Transform Fault**.

- **The difference between the fold and the fault mountains**:

| Fold mountains: | Fault/block mountains: |
|---|---|
| It is because of the folding process. | Due to the Faulting process |
| Only compressional force | Both compressional and tension force |
| They are greater in length | They are greater in width. |
| For example, Himalayas and Alps | For example, Vindhyas and Black forest |

- **Isostatic movements**: **Isostasy** is the state of equilibrium or balance in the earth's crust. **Isostatic movements** involve vertical movements under the action of floatation displacement between the rock layers of differing density and mobility. This is to achieve balanced crustal columns of uniform mass above a level of compensation in which the topographic elevation is inversely related to underlying rock density. For example, the Mountains have deep roots, the **Scandinavian** mountains due to the melting of ice sheets are observing the gradual rising of the land which is evident in a series of raised beaches.

- **Eustatic movements**: They involve the worldwide movement of sea level resulting from changes in the total volume of liquid seawater or capacity of ocean basins. For example, the convection in the mantle would arch up an oceanic ridge and displace water from ocean basins as the capacity of basins decreases.

- **Continental drift theory**: The continental drift theory was proposed by **Alfred Wegner** in **1912**. The theory was proposed to explain major variations in the earth's climate.
    - **Assumptions**: The three layers of the earth with outer **SiAl**, intermediate **SiMa**, and inner **NiFe**. **SiAl** was the continental mass, whereas **SiMa** was the oceanic crust. **SiAl** masses were assumed to be floating on **SiMa** without any resistance.
    - **The Theory**: Before the **Carboniferous** period, there was only one supercontinent called **Pangea** and one super ocean called **Panthalassa**. This **Supercontinent** was separated into northern **Angara land**/**Laurasia** and the southern **Gondwanaland** by a rift from east to west around **225 million years ago**. The northern part consisted of **North America**, **Greenland**, and **Eurasia** without **India** and **Arabia**. The southern **Gondwanaland** consisted of **Africa**, **South America**, **India**, **Australia**, and **Antarctica**. The **Angara land** and the **Gondwanaland** were separated by the **Tethys Sea**. Another North-South rift separated **North America** from **Eurasia** and **South America** from **Africa**, which started to move towards the West. **Africa** moved towards the north, **Antarctica** towards the south, and **Australia** towards the east. **India** started moving towards the North. Around **20 million years ago**, **Arabia** got separated from **Africa** and merged into **Asia**.
    - **Forces responsible for the continental drift**: **Alfred Wegner** proposed the following forces as the cause of continental motion: **Equatorward** or **North-South** movement caused by the **Pole-fleeing force** due to **Gravitational differential force** and the **force of Buoyancy** to adjust the center of gravity and the center of **Buoyancy**. The westward movement is caused by the tidal forces of the **Sun** and **Moon**.
    - **Evidence in support of continental drift theory**:
(image of continental drift evidence map)
        - **zig-saw fits of continents**: That is similarities in coastlines on opposite sides of the Oceans.
        - **Structural pieces of evidence**: The mountain belts of **Brazil** terminate on the **South American east coast** and the same type of mountains reappeared again in **Africa**.
        - **Stratigraphic pieces of evidence**: The eastern coast of brazil has the same type of rock formations observed along with **Northwest Africa**.
        - **Fossil evidence**: **Mesosaurus** is an aquatic reptile whose fossil remains are found only in eastern **South America** and **South Africa**. Also, the fossils of **Glossopteris** grown only in subpolar climates are now found in warm climatic regions separated by wide Oceans.
    - **Criticisms**: The geophysical mechanic envisaged for the movement of continents was considered inadequate. The rocks of continental crust and oceanic crust are very rigid and would not permit the drifting of continents over the oceanic floor. The theory did not describe the situations of pre-carboniferous times.

- **Seafloor spreading theory**:
    - **Mapping of oceanic floor revealed the following information**
        - Presence of mid-oceanic ridges along the seafloor. These ridges are active that is continuous volcanic eruptions occur.
        - Rocks are of similar composition and magnetic properties on either side of the ridge.
        - Rocks are of the same age on either side and age increases away from the ridge.
        - Oceanic crust is thinner than continental crust.
        - Age of oceanic basins much younger than continents.
    - Based on these observations **Harry Hess** in **1961** proposed the theory of seafloor spreading. According to this theory, the constant magmatic eruptions along the oceanic ridges causes the rupture of oceanic crust. The new lava wedges onto the oceanic crust and this pushes the oceanic crust on either side causing the ocean floor to spread. The spreading crust sinks down at the oceanic trenches and gets consumed.

- **Plate tectonic theory**: The term plate was coined by **J T Wilson** in **1965**. Plates are broad rigid segments of the lithosphere which include the rigid upper part of the upper mantle and the crust. The theory of plate tectonics was proposed by **Morgan**, **Mackenzie**, and **parker** in **1967**. plate tectonics is the study of deformation within plates and of the interaction of plates around their margins. The plates are nearly **100 km** thick and move slowly on the underlying asthenosphere. The plates are highly rigid and are unable to deform except in response to very strong and prolonged force.

- **There are seven major plates**
    - North America
    - South American
    - Eurasian
    - African
    - Indo Australian
    - Antarctica
    - Pacific

- **There are many minor plates such as**:
    - Arabian plates.
    - Philippines plates.

- **Difference with respect to continental drift theory**: Continental drift theory assumed that **SIAL** floats over **SIMA** whereas **Plate tectonic theory** proposes that lithosphere can be made of continental and oceanic crust. Continental drift theory proposes free-floating of continents whereas **Plate tectonic theory** suggests that the plate offers high resistance during the movement.

- **Plate Movements**: Plates are constantly in motion but with different speeds and directions. This causes three kinds of plate boundaries.
    1. **Divergent plate boundary** (constructive margin):
        - **Ocean-Ocean divergence** – its zone of tension where lithosphere splits, separates and moves apart into opposite directions. The hot magma which comes up through the cracks solidifies leading to the formation of a new oceanic crust. Gradually both sides of the Oceanic crust spreads away from the mid-oceanic ridge.
        - **Continent-Continent divergence**: It involves the following three stages:
            - **Intra-continental rifting**: The upward movement of magma in the form of rising plumes and molten rock material from below causes the fragmentation of the continental crust. This causes the creation of numerous cracks and a rift valley. Rising magma starts to come out of this rift valley. Example **East African rift valley**.
            - **Inter-plate thinning** It involves the partial melting of the lithosphere and gradual thinning of continental plates; rift valley starts to widen and may gradually get filled with ocean water example **RED SEA**
            - **Formation of Mid-Oceanic Ridge**: Continues spreading of plates and creation of new plate material along the rift valley pushes the two continental masses sufficiently apart. At this stage, there will be a new oceanic basin along both sides of the Ridge. Example **Mid Atlantic ridge**.
    2. **Convergent plate boundary** (destructive plate margin):
        - **Oceanic -Oceanic convergence**: When two oceanic plate margin collides oceanic plate of higher density descends into the asthenosphere. This process is called **Subduction** and the region is called the subduction zone. The subduction of the plate leads to the formation of trenches which are the deepest regions on the surface of the earth. For example, where pacific plate collides with its surrounding plates and it has resulted in **Mariana**, **Japan**, the **Philippines**, and other trenches. The subducting plate starts to melt as it reaches the deeper portions and some of its molten material finds its way upward in the form of volcanic activity. This molten material piles up continuously on the adjacent oceanic floor resulting in the formation of volcanic islands. The continuous volcanic activity gradually increases the size and elevation of volcanic islands. These islands which are arranged parallel to the trenches in an arc shape are called island arcs. Example **Japan**, **Caribbean islands**, **Aleutian**, **Andaman**, etc. **Archipelago** is a group of islands scattered in the ocean. It's formed around **Ocean-Ocean convergent plate boundary** with intense volcanic activity and shifting plate margins. Example **Indonesia**, **Philippines**. Subduction zones are the sites of the most widespread and intense earthquakes. In the case of **Ocean-Ocean plate collision** all the three types of earthquakes shallow, intermediate, and deep can be found. Majority of such earthquakes appeared to be confined to a narrow dipping zone along the subducting slab called as **Benioff zones**.
        - **Ocean-continent convergence**: It takes place when the plate-carrying oceanic crust collides with the plate-carrying continental crust. The Continental crustal being more buyout (tendency to float) forces the higher density oceanic crust into the mantle. Example **Nazca plate** subducting below **South American plate**. During subduction thick sequence of rocks along the continental margin is compressed and deformed to form a chain of fold mountains examples **Andes** and the **Rocky Mountains**. As the oceanic plate subducts, it creates trenches. Earthquakes are created at **Benioff zones**. As the oceanic plate plunges deeper it gets melted and starts to rise. This rising magma will be emplaced in the overlying continental crust which may eventually migrate to the surface leading to the formation of volcanos example subduction of the **Nazca plate** below the **South American plate** has resulted in the creation of volcanos along the **Andes** such as **Cotopaxi** (**Ecuador**), **Chimborazo**, **Ojos del Salado**. **Ocean continent collision** result in all three types of earthquakes.
        - **Continental-continental Convergence**: When two plates carrying continent crust collide it leads to the continental-continental Convergence boundary. Before the continental-continental convergence, the landmasses are separated by oceanic crust. As the plates converge, the intervening sea encloses and the seafloor subducts beneath one of the plates creating ocean-continental converge plate boundaries. The continued convergence results in complete subduction of the oceanic crust and the two continental masses get stitched together at a zone called the suture zone. The oceanic crust completely breaks from the continental block and gets completely assimilated into the mantle. At this point, volcanic activity ceases. When continental margins continue to collide, the low density of continental material doesn't permit its subduction. Continued convergence forces the continental crust partially under the other one, creating an unusually thick layer of intense folding. The sedimentary layers deposited between the continental margins undergo intense folding resulting in the formation of very high fold mountains example **Himalayas**. Shallow and intermediate earthquakes are observed along this margin.

- **Conservative plate margins**: Along the conservative plate margin, the plates slide past each other without any construction or destruction of crust. This boundary is also called parallel or transform plate boundary. For example, the **san-Andreas fault** in **California**. Transform faults are also found on the oceanic crust, where they offset two different parts of oceanic ridges.

- **Plate boundaries**

| Landform | Divergent (O-O) plates | Divergent (C-C) plates | Convergent (O-O) plates | Convergent(O-C) plates | Convergent (C-C) plates |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Landform | Mid oceanic ridges, transform faults. | Rift valley, shallow sea, MOR, Block Mountains | Trenches, subduction zones, archipelago island arcs, Benioff zone. | Trenches, subduction zones, fold mountains, volcanoes Benioff zone. | suture zone, partial subduction, geo-syncline, fold mountains. |
| Earthquakes | shallow. | shallow. | shallow, intermediate and deep. | shallow, intermediate and deep. | shallow and intermediate |
| volcanism | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Examples | Mid Atlantic Ridge, East pacific rise. | East African rift valley, Red sea, Mid Atlantic ridges | Japan, Aleutian, Indonesia, etc. | Andes, Rockies mountains. | The Himalayas, Alps. |

- **Causes of Plates movements**:
    1. **The convection currents**: There are two types of convection current, one involves the whole of the mantle and the second involves only the asthenosphere. They are generated due to the intense heat released from the interior of the earth. The theory of convention current was proposed by **Arthur homes**. As the currents ascend from below they diverge and spread laterally. The convection causes the lithosphere to split and as the plates move laterally the currents carry the slab of the lithosphere with them. This is the site of oceanic ridges. When these currents encounter a similar current from the opposite direction, they descend into the deeper part of the mantle and drag the lithosphere down into the mantle at trenches.
    2. **Mantle plumes**: It is a type of mantle convention that involves jet-like plumes of low-density magma material from the core-mantle boundary. As the plume reaches the lithosphere it spreads out latterly dooming the surface zones of earth and moving them along the direction of the mantle plume. Mantle plumes are also the cause of the formation of volcanic hot spots, for example, reunion, Hawaii, etc.
    3. **Ridge push**: The magma rushes along the oceanic ridges from wedges of the new lithosphere on either side trail edge of the plate and causes the plates to be pushed apart.
    4. **Gravity sliding**: The spreading centres along the mid-ocean ridges stand high on the oceanic floor this results in the gravitation side of the lithospheric slab being away from the oceanic ridges.
    5. **Slab pull**: It is considered to be along the subduction zone where the subducting plate pulls the rest of the slab along.

- **The criticism of plate tectonic theory**: The theory although is widely expected is not able to explain the following: Plate tectonics in the past like the formation of earlier mountains, movements of different plates, and how they were different from the present ones. Both **Africa** and **Antarctica** are surrounded by ridges but have no subduction zones to accommodate the new lithosphere being generated.

## Volcanism
- **Volcanism** includes all the phenomena associated with the movement of molten material from the interior of the earth to the surface. It involves three main processes:
    - **Generation of magma** due to an increase in heat, decrease in pressure, or increase in water content, it is generated in the asthenosphere and the lower part of the mantle. The intrusion of magma into the lithospheric region and Extrusion of magma onto the surface of the earth.
    - **Magma**: **Magma** is hot, mobile and molten silicate material. It is made up of a combination of solid, liquid, and gases. When magma reaches the surfaces, it erupts as lava. **Lava** is hotter and more volatile than magma. It cools either on the surface or underwater.
    - **Types of Magma**: There are mainly two types of magma:

| Granitic magma: | Basaltic magma: |
|---|---|
| It has a high silica content (more the **60-70%**). | It has less than **52%** silica content. |
| It has a lower density | It has a higher density |
| Continental crust is made up of granite magma | Oceanic crust is made up of basaltic magma. |
| The average temperature is lower | The average temperature is higher. |
| It has low fluidity. | It has low fluidity. |
| It is generated at ocean-continent convergence and it is generated rarely. | It is generated at **O-O Divergence C-C divergence**, hotspots, etc. |

- **Magma generation and plate tectonics**:
    - **Divergent plate boundaries**: In **C-C divergence** at **Rift valley** and **O-O divergence** at **Mid oceanic ridge**. The Source of the magma is convection current. There is the eruption of basaltic magma which forms a continental crust. The eruption is slow and continuous.
    - **Convergent plate boundaries**: At **O-O** (volcanic islands) and **O-C convergence** (fold mountains volcanoes). The source is the partial melting of the oceanic crust. It leads to the generation of **Andesitic magma**.
    - **Andesitic magma**: It is mix of granitic and basaltic magma. The sediments that are deposited on the ocean are granitic and along with the ocean plates they also subduct and thus lead to the formation of andesitic manga. It is generated along the subduction zone. Magma is violent and explosive along with the volcanic cones.
    - **Hotspots**: The source is the mantle plume. It results in the generation of basaltic magma.

- **Distribution of volcanoes**:
    - **Ridge volcanism**: Along the oceanic floor through mid-oceanic ridges.
        - Nonexplosive, smooth, and continuous magma. For example, mid-oceanic ridges in the **Atlantic Ocean**, **East Pacific Rise**, and **Carlsberg ridge**.
    - **Arc Volcanism**: Found along ocean-ocean convergence boundaries forming island arcs. For example, **Japan**, the **Aleutian Islands**, **Caribbean islands**, etc.
    - **Volcanic chains**: Found along ocean-continent convergent plate boundaries. For examples **Andes** and **Rockies**.
    - **Volcanic clusters**: Found along the continent-continent divergent boundary. For Example, east **African rift valley**
    - **Volcanic lines**: Line of volcanoes arranged along with the hotspots. Example **Hawaii islands** and **Reunion islands**.

- **Type of volcanoes based on activity**:
    - **Active volcano**: It has erupted once in recorded history. It has contact with the magma chamber.
    - **Dormant volcano**: It has contact with the magma chamber. It has not erupted in recorded history but it may erupt in the future.
    - **Extinct volcano**: It has erupted in the past. But now have lost contact with the magma chamber.

- **Volcanic landforms**: There are two types of volcanic landforms, Intrusive and extrusive landforms.
    1. **Extrusive landforms**: These are the landforms that are formed on the earth's surface as magma cools down above the surface.
    - **Volcanic cones**-there are **3 major types of volcanic cones**:
        - **Shield volcano**: They are found across hotspots. Magma is basaltic, thus flowing easily. The magma spreads out over a very long distance. They are very large and very less steep. Examples of shield volcanoes are the **Volcanoes of Hawaii island** (**Mauna Loa** and **Mauna Kea**)
        - **Ash-cinder volcano**: They are formed due to the accumulation of loose particles around the volcanic vents. The continued accumulation of ash and debris increases its size. The cone is smaller in size and lowers in height. An intermediate layer of lava solidifies the ash content. They are not as steep as composite volcanoes. An example includes the **Taal volcano** in the **Philippines**.
        - **Composite volcano**: They are formed by cooler and viscous lava. They are made up of andesitic manga. They are steeper than the other types.
        - They are formed due to the accumulation of viscous lava such as andesitic. Acumination of lava increases the height and slope. They are one of the steepest volcanoes. The viscous lava makes them explosive. Example **Mount Fuji** in **Japan**, **Krakatoa**, etc.
        - **Crater**: It is a depression formed at the mouth of the volcano. It is funnel-shaped. The crater filled with water results in the formation of a crater lake.
        - **Caldera**: It is a greatly enlarged depression resulting from the violent eruption and subsidence of a volcano. **Caldera** may also result in the **caldera lake**.
    - **Flood basalt province**: It is formed by the eruption of highly fluid basaltic magma. Which flows for a long distance covering **1000s of Km^2** areas. For example, **Deccan province**.
    - **Hot springs**/**thermal springs**: When water sinks deep enough beneath the surface to be heated by a hot spot or magma chamber. it rises to the surface continuously without any explosion. They contain dissolved minerals with medicinal value. For example, the hot springs in **Iceland**, and **India** (**Manikaran**, **Tattapani**, **Manali**, **Rajgir** etc).
    - **Geysers**: They are the fountains of hot water and superheated steam, ejected at regular intervals with explosions. For example, **Geysers of Iceland**, **New Zealand**, **USA** (**Old faithful Geysers**).
    - **Fumarole**: It involved continuous jet-like emission of steam and other gases without water.
    - **Mud volcano**: It involves the eruption of a mixture of mud, water, and gases. It is associated with a subduction zone. For example, **Baratang island** of **Andaman** and **Nicobar**.

- **Intrusive volcanic landforms**:
    - These are the landforms that are formed inside the earth's surface as manga cools down below the surface.
    - **Batholiths**: It is a long irregular dome-shaped structure. They are large bodies formed by the cooling of magma in deeper depths.
    - **Laccoliths**: It is a mushroom-shaped structure formed due to the intrusion of magma. It maintains contact with the magma chamber.
    - **Lopoliths**: When the magma solidifies in saucer-shaped depression along shallow basins it results in lopoliths.
    - **Sill**: These are formed by the cooling of magma in horizontal bedding planes.
    - **Dykes**: These are wall-like structures formed by the cooling of magma in the vertical direction.

- **Geomagnetism**: The magnetic field associated with the earth is called geomagnetism. Earth has an outer rocky mantle, below which there is the liquid outer core that surrounds the solid inner core. It is considered that the motion of iron charges in the outer core generates the Magnetic field around the earth. The motion of iron charged particles is caused by Rotation of earth and convection current is due to the heat generated in the core of the earth.

- **Significance of Geomagnetism**:
    - **Palaeomagnetism**: It is the historical study of earth magnetism through rock. When the ingenious manga crystallizes, the crystal of ferromagnetic minerals such as iron, titanium, etc acquires stable magnetism which becomes frozen as the magma cools down. This acquired magnetism is called fossil magnetism. Such rocks will have ferromagnetic minerals aligned in the same direction as that of the geomagnetic field at the time of its consolidation.
    - **Polar wandering**: When paleomagnetic pieces of evidence for a given region were checked over a long period a gradual change in direction was detected. It shows that the position of magnetic poles has moved over of period, this movement is called polar wandering. During the study of fossil magnetism some of the rocks were found pointing toward the north and some towards the south, this was due to the reversal of the earth's magnetic flied which is called a magnetic reversal. Such a reversal of magnetic field can be brought by a reversal of convention current in the outer core. The magnetic reversal occurs every **2,00,000-300,000 years**.
    - **Aurora**: When the magnetic field around the earth blocks charge partials from solar winds, some of these charged particles get trapped near the polar regions where the magnetic lines are straight. When these charged particles interact with the gases in the atmosphere they produce spectacular lights called **Aurora**. It is called **Aurora Borealis** in the northern region and **Aurora Australis** in the southern region.

- **Earthquakes**: The vibration or oscillation of the earth is caused by a transient disturbance of the elastic or gravitational equilibrium of the rocks at or beneath the surface of the earth. The scientific study of earthquakes is called seismology.

- **The various causes of earthquakes are**:
    - **Natural causes**: Plate movements (Intra-plate and inter-plate), Volcanic eruption, Landside on a very large scale, Subsidence, Meteors, Glacial outburst.
    - **Man-made causes**: Mining, Atomic explosion, Reservoir-induced seismicity-when earthquakes are caused due to the construction of large dams on soft rocks.

- **Earthquake waves**: Focus is the point inside the earth, where energy is released. The epicentre is the point on the surface nearest to the focus. Whenever the earthquake takes place different types of waves are released.
    - **Body waves**: They are the earthquake waves generated at the focus and move through the interior of the earth. They are mainly of two types i.e. **Primary**(**P-wave**) and **secondary**(**S-wave**).
    - **P-waves**: These waves are similar to sound waves. They vibrate back and forth in the direction of propagation. They are also called compressional waves and longitudinal waves. They are the first to be detected during an earthquake. The movement of the **P-save** depends on the density and the compressibility of the material. **P- waves** can pass through solid, liquid, and gases material, however, there will be variations in speed.
    - **S-waves**: They are similar to light waves. They are records after the **P-waves**. It is called transverse waves as they vibrate perpendicularly to the direction of propagation. For **S-wave** to pass, the material should be rigid. Thus **S-wave** can pass only through solid and not through liquid or gases.
    - **Surface waves**: They are generated due to the interaction of body waves with the surface and generally at the epicentre. **Surface waves** are slower than body waves and are capable of causing more damage.

- **Significance of earthquake wave**: The earthquake waves undergo reflection, bending, or changes in the direction while passing from one medium to another. By studying the extent of deflection, change in the speed we can conclude about the earth's interior and understand the nature of different layers

- **Earthquake waves shadow zone**: The **Shadow zone** is the zone in the earth's interior from where earthquake waves are not reported. **Shadow zones** occur due to the bending of earthquake waves as they pass from one medium to another.
    - **P-wave shadow zone**: **P-waves** are not detected between **105-145 degrees** from the focus which is called as **P-wave shadow zone**, it is due to the bending and slowing down (due to change in density) of **P-waves** as it enters the outer core.
    - **S-wave shadow zone**: **S-waves** cannot pass through the outer core which is liquid and it results in an **S-wave shadow zone** beyond **105 degrees** from the focus.
(image of P-wave ray paths and S-wave ray paths)

- **Type of earthquake**: Based upon the location of the focus the earthquake is of three types:
    - **Shallow focus earthquake**: It occurs at the depth of **0-70 km**. Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous as they are located near the earth's surface and thus have more intensity.
    - **Intermediate focus earthquake**: It occurs at the depth of **0-350 km**.
    - **Deep focus earthquake**: It occurs at the depth of **0-700 km**.

- **Distribution of earthquakes**:
    - **Circum-pacific belt**: For example, **Japan**, the **Philippines**, **Indonesia**
    - **Meditarian** and **trans-Asiatic belt**. For example, **Italy**, **Switzerland**, **Himalayas**.
    - **Mid-oceanic ridges**: For example, **Iceland**, etc.
    - **East African rift valley**.

- **Measurement of earthquakes**:
    - **Recording of earthquake waves**: The earthquake waves can be recorded by a seismograph. The record produced by the seismograph is called a seismogram. The highest recorded earthquake is a **9.5 Richter scale** in **Chile** in **1960**. **2004 Indian ocean**(**Indonesia**) earthquake was **9.1 magnitudes**. **2011 japan** earthquake was **9.1 magnitudes**. **2015 Nepal** earthquake was **7.1 magnitudes**.

- **Magnitude and intensity of the earthquakes**

| Magnitude: | Intensity: |
|---|---|
| It is a measure of the amount of energy released by the earthquake | Intensity is the evaluation of the severity of the earthquake which can be assessed by the visible damage caused. |
| It is objective. | It is subjective. |
| The magnitude of the earthquake remains the same. | Intensity may decrease away from the center. |
| The magnitude of the earthquake is measured by the **Richter scale**. There is no upper limit for the **Richter scale**. **Richter scale** is a logarithm scale that is **1-unit** change means a **10 times stronger** earthquake. | Intensity is measured by a **Mercalli scale**. The range of the **Mercalli scale** is **1-12**. |

- **Earthquake in India**:
    - **2001 Bhuj** earthquake was **7.7 magnitudes**.
    - **2005 earthquake** in **Kashmir** was of **7.7 magnitudes**.
    - **2011 Sikkim** earthquake was of **6.9 magnitudes**.
    - **1993 Latur** earthquake was of **6.9 magnitudes**.
    - **1991 Uttarkashi** earthquake was of **6.1 magnitudes**.

- **Effects of earthquakes**: Loss of life, Volcanic eruption, Landslides, Flash floods, Fires, Tsunami, liquefaction, etc.

- **Tsunami**: A tsunami is a Japanese word for harbour waves. They are also called seismic sea waves. They are four stages in the life cycle of a tsunami:
    - **Generation**: Tsunamis are caused by the vertical displacement of the water columns which can be caused by: **Earthquakes**-The normal and reverse fault earthquake leads to the vertical displacement of the water column causing a tsunami, Volcanic eruption on the ocean floor, Underwater landslide, Nuclear tests, Meteorites impact, Subsidence.
    - **Propagation in deep water**: In deep waters, the speed of waves is very high and the amplitude is low. Therefore, tsunami will not be visible in the open ocean nor will cause any damage.
    - **Propagation in shallow water**: As the wave approaches the coast, the depth decreases thus amplitude (wave height) increases, and speed decreases. This causes a pilling up of water near the coast, generating very high waves, this is called the **shoaling effect**.
    - **Landfall**: Where the waves break and submerge the coastal regions.

- **Geomorphic process**:
    - **Exogenic movements**: These are the earth's movements caused due to various forces acting from outside the earth's surface.
    - **The source of energy for the exogenic movement are**: Solar energy, Gravity.
    - These movements are caused by **5 major agents**: Winds, River waters, Glaciers, Underground waters, Coastal waters.
    - The exogenic movements involve aggregation and degradation.
        - **Aggregation**: It is the action of the various processes that cause deposition on the surface to bring uniformity of grade i.e. slope.
        - **Degradation**/**Denudation**: It is the combined action of various processes that cause the varying away of the earth's surface and causes a general lowering and levelling out of the surface. It involved various processes like weathering, transportation, erosion, and mass movement.

- **Weathering**: It is the total effect of various processes that cooperate in bringing about the decay and disintegration of rocks involving no large-scale transportation. Weathering is an in-situ process and does not involve the transport of degraded rock materials.

- **Factors affecting weathering**:
    - **Rock type and structure**: It includes Rock massiveness, Porosity, Permeability, presence of fractures, etc. for example, Sedimentary rocks are weathered faster than Igneous rocks
    - **Slope and aspect**: A steep slope will result in faster weathering as the disintegrated material will be removed faster Slopes that are exposed to wind and rainfall are more prone to weathering. For example- the southern slopes of the **Himalayas**
    - **Temperature**: Range of temperature both diurnal and Annual subjects the surface layer to expansion and contraction Temperature also increases the rate of chemical reactions.
    - **Water**: The presence or absence of water decides the chemical reaction. For Example, Arid regions: Less chemical reactions; Equatorial regions: More Less chemical reactions; When water is added or removed it imposes mechanical stress on the rocks and the crack
    - **Biological factors**: It includes the action of plant roots. Decomposing vegetation and burrowing animals.

- **Different types of weathering**:
    - **Mechanical weathering**:
        - **Crystal Growth**:
            - **Water Crystal**: When water finds its way through cracks or pores it wedges apart. Rock fissures and joints. In Desert regions, It results in frost shattering, and in Glacial regions, it causes freeze-thaw
            - **Salt Crystals**: The growth of salt crystals by crystallization as moisture evaporates creating pressure in pore spaces and cracks are called salt weathering or haloclasty.
        - **Pressure**/**Thermal Expansion**:
            - **Pressure release**: Confining pressure from the weight of overlying rocks is released when the overlying layer is removed by erosion. This causes Rock to expand leading to the development of fractures
            - **Exfoliation**: The rapid expansion and contraction of the surface rocks weakens the outer shell creating fissures causing the rock shell to peel off **Block disintegration**- When a rock breaks up into blocks
            - **Granular disintegration**: When a rock breaks as small granule
    - **Chemical weathering**:
        - **Hydrolysis**: Chemical union of water and mineral is known as hydrolysis. It results in a solution.
        - **Hydration**: It involves when the water is incorporated into the molecular structure of minerals. It causes swelling
        - **Oxidation-Reduction**: It involves the addition or removal of oxygen. It causes discoloration. They are the first visible signs of chemical weathering
        - **Carbonation**: Rainwater absorbs **CO2** as it falls through the air and gets converted into carbonic acid. Limestones and dolomites are altered by the dissolving action of carbonic acids.
        - **Biological weathering**: It involves the breaking of particles by burrowing animals and through pressure exerted by land routes. Decomposing organic matter releases different chemicals and increases the rate of weathering

- **Erosion**: **Erosion** refers to the wearing away of land surface by the mechanical action of debris derived from weathering as they are transported to different locations by agents like wind, water, glacier, etc.
    - **Types**:
        - **Abrasion**: Wearing away of surfaces by mechanical processes like rubbing, Scratching, polishing, etc. When abrasion happens in water known as corrasion
        - **Attrition**: It involves a reduction in the size of fragments by friction and impact during transportation. It breaks down the load into finer sediments.
        - **Cavitation**: The collapse of bubbles of water in rivers leads to an explosion sending shock waves that disintegrate the adjacent rocks causing cavities.
        - **Corrosion**: It involves the wearing away of particles by the solvent and chemical action of water
        - **Deflation**: Lifting and removal of dust and sand by wind are called deflation. It involves aerial erosion removing unconsolidated material.
        - **Hydraulic Action**: Break down rocks with fast-moving water.
        - **Plucking**: As the glaciers move they track the rocks and disintegrates into smaller pieces.

- **Mass movement**: **Mass movement** under the influence of gravity with or without the assistance of running water is called **Mass wasting**. In **Mass movement** weathered material to move down a hillslope.

- **Slow Movement**:
    - **Soil Creep**: It involves slow downhill movement of the weathered mantle. It is difficult to notice but a continuous one.
    - **Solifluction**: It involves the slow movement of soil mixed with water as a viscous fluid. It is more active in glacial areas.

- **Rapid Movement**:
    - **Landslides**: The movement of a cross-section of the hill under the influence of gravity is called landslides. The material maintains continuous contact with a surface as it moves.
    - **Earth Flow**: Earth flows from terraces and hillsides which are capable of flowage when saturated with water beneath the top layer.
    - **Mud Flow**: It involves the rapid movement of masses of uncompacted soil which is saturated with water
    - **Rockfall**/**Rock Slide**: The broken rocks slide or fall along the mountainous region under the influence of gravity.

- **Landforms**:
    - **Riverine Topography**: Three different stages in the life cycle of the river:
        - Youth stage
        - Mature stage
        - Old stage
    - **Characteristics of these stages**

| Youth stage | Mature stage | Old stage |
|---|---|---|
| steep slope | Moderate slope | very low slope |
| The high energy of the river | Moderate energy | very low energy |
| Erosion is of two types: | | |
| 1. Vertical erosion | Lateral erosion: Valleys got widened | Minimal erosion/no erosion |
| 2. Lateral erosion | | |
| Valleys are too deep forming the **V-shaped valleys**. | | |
| No deposition | Little deposition | Only deposition |
| No meandering | Meandering begins | High meandering |

- **Five agents of Erosion**

| Topography | Processes active | Erosional features | Depositional features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Riverine topography**/**Fluvial topography** Agent of erosion is **River water** | Corrasion Attrition Corrosion Cavitation Hydraulic action | **V-shaped valleys** Gorge, Canyon **Waterfall**: These are of three types: **Cataracts**, **Rapids** & **Plunge pools** **Potholes**: which are circular depression. River capture River cliff (of meander) | **Slip off-slope**, **Levee** **Flood Plain**, **Delta**, **Estuary**, **Alluvial fan**, **Riverine Island** for example **Majuli island** |
| **Karst topography** The active agent of erosion: **Groundwater** Example: **Caves of Meghalaya** Rocks: **Limestone**/**dolomite** Precipitation: Moderate | Corrasion Attrition | Sinkholes, Swallow holes, Uvala, Blind valley Caves | Stalactite, Stalagmite When they merge together they form the **Cave pillar** |
| **Marine topography** The active agent of erosion: **Wave action**/**coastal waters** | corrasion attrition cavitation hydraulic action | Wave cut platform, cliff, Hanging valley, Bay Sea cave, Sea Stack, Stump | Wave built platform, Beach, Sand bar, Sandspit, Tombolo, Lagoon |

## India Physical geography
(image of India physical map)

- **Mountains**:
    1. **Origin of Himalayas**: The **Continent-Continent collision** between the **Indian Plate** and the **Eurasian plate** has resulted in the folding up of the sediments that were deposited in the shallow **Tethys sea**.
    - **Phases in the evolution of the Himalayas**:
        - **First Phase**: **120-70 million year ago**- The **Great Himalayas** were folded out of the **Tethys sea** sediments.
        - **Second Phase**: **30-25 million years ago**- the **Middle Himalayas** formation started. Along with being folded, they were also rising simultaneously.
        - **Third Phase**: **20-2 million years ago**- Folding of **Shivalik** started.
        - The compression is still happening and all three ranges are still rising. **India plate** is still moving towards the **Eurasian plate** at **3-4cm per year**. It is expected that in a few million years, another range of **Himalayas** will rise over the **Ganga basin plains** of today. Further drifting northwards, the western part of the **Indian plate** was exposed over the **Reunion hotspot** which resulted in the formation of the **Deccan lava plateau**, also called **Deccan traps**.
(image of Himalayan evolution map)

- **Syntaxial bend of Himalayas**: This is due to the maximum push offered at both ends of the **Indian peninsula** during its northward drift. In the **North West** direction, the **Aravalli**, and in the **North East**, **Assam hills** acted as two extended arms while the central area sagged giving an arcuate shape.
    - **Proof of this** - Both **Indus** and **Brahmaputra** take nearly **U-turn** in their courses.

- **Evidences for the continued rise of the Himalayas**:
    - Regular earthquakes in the **Himalayan** region.
    - Recent adjustments in the height of **Mount Everest**.
    - Rivers of the **Himalayas** are in the youthful stage and have high erosion capacity.
    - **Desiccation** (Drying up) of **Tibetan plateau** lakes, in the last **20,000 years** as even the **Tibetan plateau** is rising, lakes dry up due to increased altitudes.
    - Fractures and fault zones.

- **Fault Name**

| Region | Fault Name |
|---|---|
| From Tibet to the Ganga plains | **Indo-Tsangpo Suture Zone**. It is not entirely across the length or at the surface, but somewhere along with the depth where the plates have merged. |
| Between Great Himalayas and Middle Himalayas | **MCT**- **Main Central Thrust**. |
| Between Middle Himalayas and Shivalik | **MBT**-**Main Boundary Thrust** |
| Between Shivalik and Ganga Plains | **MFT**-**Main Frontal Thrust** |

- **Ranges of Himalayas**:
    - **Trans Himalayas**: They include some mountains on the **Tibetan plateau** that were formed before the **Greater Himalayas**- **Karakoram**, **Ladakh**, **Zanskar**, and **Kailash** ranges.
    - **Great Himalayas** (**Himadri**): They are called great because it is a single continuous range (**Nanga Parbat** to **Namcha Barwa**) with an average height of **6000 m**, and more than **10 peaks** over **8000 m**. The second highest mountain range **Andes** does not have even a single peak over **7000m**. The lowest elevation to cross is **4000 m**. Neither the **Trans Himalayas**, middle and nor the **Shivalik** is continuous.
    - **Middle Himalayas**/**Lesser Himalayas** (**Himachal**): The average height is **4000 meters**. Ranges- **Pir Panjal**, **Dhaulagiri**, **Mussorie**, **Naga tibba**, **Mahabharat range** in **Nepal**.
    - **Shivalik**: They are also called **Outer Himalayas**. The average height is **1000 m**. They are also called the **Jammu hills**. In **Arunachal Pradesh**, the lesser **Himalayas** and **Shivalik** merge.
    - **Purvanchal Himalayas**: The **Himalayan** extensions in the **North Eastern** parts of **India**.

- **Regional division of the Himalayas**:

| The region between the rivers | Name of the Himalayas |
|---|---|
| **Indus** and **Sutlej** | **Punjab** or **Kashmir Himalayas** |
| **Sutlej** and **Kali** | **Uttarakhand Himalayas**- **Kumaon Himalayas** (Eastern) **Garhwal Himalayas** (Western) |
| **Kali** and **Teesta** | **Nepal Himalayas** |
| **Teesta** and **Brahmaputra** | **Assam Himalayas** |

- **The Himalayas are also divided as**:
    - **Western Himalayas** between **Indus** and **Kali** rivers.
    - **Eastern Himalayas** between **Teesta** and **Brahmaputra** rivers.

| Western Himalayas | Eastern Himalayas |
|---|---|
| They are taller in comparison as they see more compression. | They are shorter in comparison. |
| They are drier and see less than **100 cm** of precipitation. | They are wetter as they are near to the **Bay of Bengal** and do not experience continentality. |
| Coniferous vegetation is dominant here. | Evergreen vegetation is seen as the region is nearer to the tropical region. |
| It has more number of glaciers. | It has a lesser number of glaciers. |
| They are wider. | They are narrower. |
| They rise gradually. | They see an abrupt rise. |
| They see lower biodiversity due to lesser temperature and precipitation | They are much richer in biodiversity |
| The snowline is at a lower height of around **4000 m**. **Snowline**-the altitude in a particular place above which some snow remains on the ground throughout the year. | The snowline is at a higher altitude at around **5000m** |

- **Peninsular Block**: It is a great complex of ancient rocks which has existed as a single rigid block for millions of years. However, it was subjected to a few episodes of tectonic activity as: The submergence of western parts of western ghats. Formation of rift valleys such as **Narmada**, **Tapi**, etc. Formation of **Deccan Traps**- When **Indian plate** was moving over **Reunion hotspot**. The peninsular block extends from **Gujarat** in the west to **Meghalaya** in the east, and from the plains in the north to **Kanyakumari** in the south. **Aravalli** are a type of old fold mountains that were formed during the **Caledonian period**.
(image of Deccan Traps and other geological features)

- **Classification of mountains as per their period of origin**:
    - **Precambrian mountains**: They belong to the **Pre-Cambrian period**, a period that extended for more than **4 billion years**.
    - **Caledonian mountains**: They originated due to the great mountain-building movements and associated tectonic movements of the late **Silurian** and early **Devonian** periods (approximately **430 million years** and **380 million years ago**).
    - **Hercynian mountains**: These mountains originated during the upper **Carboniferous** to **Permian Period** in **Europe** (approximately **340 million years** and **225 million years ago**). They were formed during the formation of **Pangea**. **Alpine mountain system** Has its origin in the **Tertiary Period** (**65 million years** to **7 million years ago**).
    - The **Deccan traps** also extend to **Gujarat**, **Rajasthan**, **Haryana**, and **Delhi**. **Vindhyas** and **Satpuras** are block mountains.
    - **Meghalaya plateau**- **Garo**, **Khasi**, and **Jaintia hills** are also extensions of the **Deccan traps**. Other plateaus in the region-**Malwa plateau**, **Bundelkhand plateau**, **Chotanagpur plateau**. **Raajmahal hills** are an extension of the **Chotanagpur plateau** in the **Malda gap**. **Decan plateau**, **Telangana plateau**, **Rayalaseema plateau**
    - **Malnad**- They are the hilly regions around western Ghats.

- **Maidan**- The plain regions over the plateau.
- **Plains**: They are of two types- Riverine and coastal (also due to rivers, but near the coast).
    - **Northern Plains**: The **Northern Plains** are formed when the deposition of sediments brought by the **Himalayan** rivers. These sediments fill the geosyncline existing between the **Himalayan** mountains and the peninsular block. This is the largest alluvial plain in the world that extends **3200km** of which the **Indian** part accounts for **2400 km**.
(image of The Great Plain of North India map)

- **Regional divisions of northern plains**: **Rajasthan Plains**. **Punjab-Haryana Plains**. **Ganga Plains**. **Brahmaputra Plains**.
    - **Rajasthan Plains**: It was believed that the **Rajasthan desert** region was once a flourishing fertile region.
    - There are some theories that why it turned into a desert: Change in pattern of the **Indian monsoon**. Drying up of the mythical **Saraswati river**.
    - **Some theories behind Saraswati drying up**: Change in the course due to tectonic activity. River capture by **Ganga**. Anthropogenic causes by probably the **Indus Valley civilization**. The present-day **Rajasthan** consists of:
        - **Western part**- **Marusthali**, **Eastern part**- **Rajasthani Bagar**. **Luni River** is an example of Inland drainage as the river originates in **Aravalli**, enters **Gujarat**, and then disappears in the **Rann of Kutch** without meeting the sea.
        - **Punjab-Haryana Plains**: The **Indus plains** in **India**. **Indus Jhelum Chenab** rivers are with **Pakistan** and **Ravi**, **Beas**, and **Sutlej** rivers are with **India**. We can still construct run-off river projects on the **Pakistani** rivers. The land between two rivers- **Doab**.
        - **Ganga Plains**: It approximately runs from **Delhi** to **Kolkata**. The **Delhi ridge** separates the **Indus plains** from the **Ganga plains**. The westernmost part is called **Doab**. It includes **Rohilkhand plains**, **Awadh plains**, **lower Ganga plains**
        - **Brahmaputra plains**: **Sadiya** to **Dhubri** which also is the **National Waterway Number 2**.
(image of Division of Northern Plains of India on the basis of Geomorphological Features)
        - **Bhabhar**: It is a region of porous gravels and boulders where the river streams disappear and start flowing underground.
        - **Terai**: It is the marshy waterlogged regions after bhabhar where the river streams start to re-appear. It is known for the cultivation of rice, sugarcane, etc. It is also prone to water-borne diseases like **Japanese Encephalitis**. Some regions that lie in **Terai** are **Saharanpur**, **Bulandshahar**, **Uttar Pradesh-Nepal Border**, and **Bihar-Nepal border**.
        - **Khadar**: The alluvial plain is just next to the river valley. It is made up of fresh alluvium. It is more fertile than **Bangar** as it is replenished every year
        - **Bangar**: The river plain is away from the river valley that is made up of older alluvium. It is more well settled and has developed multiple layers, unlike **Khadar**.

- **Differences between the Western Ghats and Indian Ghats**

| Western Ghats | Eastern Ghats |
|---|---|
| They are continuous | They are discontinuous as they are divided by the sedimentation of rivers. The entire slope of the land is west to east, hence most rivers flow in that direction. |
| They are taller. | They are of shorter height. |
| They see higher rains. | They see lower rains. |
| They are narrower. | They are wider, |
| They have richer biodiversity. | They have comparatively lesser biodiversity. |
| Their height increases towards the south and **Anai Mudi** (**Kerala**) is the highest peak. | Their height increases towards the north and **Mahendragiri** (**Odisha**) is the highest peak. |
| They are closer to the coast | They are farther from the coast |

- **Coastal plains**:
    - **The difference between Western & Eastern coastal plains**.

| Western Plains | Eastern Plains |
|---|---|
| They extend from **Kutch** to **Kanyakumari**. | They extend from **Sundarban** to **Kanyakumari**. |
| The western coastal plain is narrower at an average width of **65 km**. | The eastern coastal plains are wider at average width of **150-200 km**. |
| The western plains see estuaries where the river meets the sea. For example- **Narmada**, **Tapi**, etc. | Rivers form deltas. For example- **Sundarbans** |
| The western coastline is indented so it has more number of natural harbours. | The eastern coastline is smooth and hence has fewer natural ports. |
| The coastline is more of erosional nature | The coastline is more of depositional nature |
| The western coastal plains are of submerged nature due to continuous erosion. Creeks are very common. | The eastern coastal plains are emergent due to deposition and see beaches and land bars. |
| There is a broader continental shelf across the coast. | There is a narrower continental shelf across the coast. |

- **Drainage system**:
    - **Evolution of Himalayan Drainage**: The widely accepted theory regarding the evolution of the **Himalayas** proposes the existence of a single river all along the entire stretch of the **Himalayas** flowing from East to West called as **Indo-Brahma** or **Tethys river** or **Shivalik river**. It drains into the **Gulf of Sindh**. This earlier drainage system was disturbed by three main events.
        - Upliftment of western **Himalayas**.
        - Upliftment of **Potwar Plateau** and **Delhi Ridge**.
        - Downfaulting of **Malda Gap**.
    - This divided the entire river into three river systems:
        - **Indus** and its Tributaries.
        - **Ganga** and its tributaries.
        - **Brahmaputra** and its tributaries.
    - **Evolution of Peninsular drainage**: The **Peninsular Drainage system** evolved over a period of time and was influenced by three main events:
        1. Submergence of the **Western side** of the **Western Ghats** disturbed the symmetrical pattern of rivers
        2. Upliftment of the **Himalayas** which caused the **Northern slope** of **Vindhyas** to tilt more towards the North and the deepening of **Rift Valleys** of **Narmada** and **Tapi**.
        3. The slight tilting of the **Peninsular block** from **North West** to **South East** direction causes slope towards the **Bay of Bengal**.

- **Differences between Himalayan and Peninsular Drainage systems**:

| Himalayan Drainage system | Peninsular Drainage System |
|---|---|
| Perennial | Seasonal |
| Fed by Glaciers | Monsoon |
| Its catchment area and drainage basin are large | Its catchment area and drainage basin are small. |
| Younger | older |
| Erosional capacity is very high | Low erosional capacity |
| **V-Shaped valleys** | Shallow Valleys |
| High Meander | Low meander |
| Large Deltas | Smaller or no deltas |
| Antecedent rivers | Consequent rivers |
| Drainage pattern-Dendritic | Drainage pattern -Rectangular/Trellis |

- **Drainage pattern**: Flow characteristics of a river is called Drainage pattern.
    1. **Dendritic Pattern**: The rivers form a dense network of Tributaries and appear like veins of a leaf or branches of a tree. It is found in regions with a lack of structural control and sedimentary plains. Example, **Ganga system**, **Indus system**.
(image of various drainage patterns)
    2. **Rectangular pattern**: The river takes sharp right turns It is prevalent in Plateau regions with hard rocks. The land has high structural control. Example, **Mahanadi**, the **Godavari**, **Krishna**, **Cauvery**, etc
    3. **Trellis Pattern**: The main rivers flow in a rift valley and flow straight. The tributaries join them at **90 °**. For example, **Narmada**, **Tapi**.
    4. **Radial Drainage**: The rivers originate from a highland or mountain and are flowing in different directions. For example, **Narmada** and **Son** from **Amarkantak**.
    5. **Parallel Drainage**: The rivers run parallel to each other and enter the ocean. For example, the West flowing rivers of **Western Ghats**.

- **The climate of India**:
    - **The factors affecting India's climate**: **India** is called a **Tropical country** with a characteristic tropical climate. However, there are varied climatic conditions across different parts of **India**.
    - **The factors which are responsible are**:
        - **Latitudinal Extent**: The extent of **30°** results in nearly climatic conditions of Tropical to sub-tropical type.
        - **Location**: It is located near the **Indian Ocean**. This has resulted in moderating effect across a major part of the country.
        - **Presence of Himalayas**: The **Himalayas** protect **India** from the Cold and dry winds of **Central Asia** during winters. It also acts as a major factor in the formation of **Monsoon**.
        - **Other topographical Features**:
            - **Presence of Western Ghats**: These are Perpendicular to **Monsoon** winds. **Aravalli** and **Coromandal coasts** are parallel to **Monsoon** winds.
            - **Monsoon winds**: The most dominant factor of the **Indian Climate** due to which it is called as **Monsoon climate**.
            - **Jet streams**: **Subtropical Westerly Jet Stream**, **Easterly Jet Stream**, **Somali Jet Stream** Influence the winter and summer weather conditions in **India**.
            - **Cyclones**: Both Tropical, as well as Temperate cyclones, affect **Indian Climate**.
            - **El Nino**, **La Nina**, **MJO**, and **IOD** are largely responsible for variations in monsoon in **India**.

- **Monsoon**: The word **Monsson** is derived from the **Arabic** word, **Mausam** which means season.

- **Classical Theory**: This explains the phenomenon of the **Monsoon** as huge land and sea breeze because of the reversal of temperature and weather conditions in the **Northern plains** from Summer to winter. During Summer the high temperature and low pressure attract winds from the **Arabian Sea**. During winters, low temperature, and high pressure causes winds to blow away from the plains towards the sea.

- **Modern Theory**:
    - **Winter**: Low temperature and High pressure cause **Anti-cyclonic conditions** over **Northern plains**. Winds blow outward from the land over which air is subsiding. The **Sub tropically jet streams** are strong and well established. It is bifurcated into **2 branches** over the North and the winds are cold and dry and blow outward from the land over which air is subsiding. The **Sub Tropical Westerly Jet Stream** is strongly established and bifurcated into two branches over the North and South of the **Tibetan Plateau**. The Southern branch is stronger and is well established along the **Northern Ganga Plains**. This intensifies surface anticyclones leading to clear and dry sky weather. The winds blow from land to Sea in **North East** direction. **North East** winds after crossing the **Bay of Bengal** pick up moisture and cause precipitation along the **Coromandal Coast**.
    - **Spring Conditions**: The weather is extremely hot and dry. The **sub-tropical Westerly Jet stream** begins to weaken and the Southern Branch eventually moves entirely to the north of the **Tibetan Plateau**. The temperature starts to rise and pressure drops. These conditions lead to convection resulting in precipitation called **Pre-Monsoon Showers**. For example, **Mango showers** in **Kerala**, **Karnataka**, **Cherry Blossom** or **Blossom**, shower in **Kerala** and **Karnataka**, **Nor Wester** or **Kal Baisakhi** or **Bardoli Cheerha** in **Odisha**, **West Bengal**, and **Assam**, **Loo** in **Northern Plains**
    - **Summer**: The low-pressure cell is completely developed over the desert on the **Northern plains**. **ITCZ** is shifted completely North and is lying over **Northern plains** which is called as **Monsoon Trough**. this attracts **Southern trade winds** towards North of the Equator which after crossing it turns right under **Coriolis force** and starts to blow as **South West Monsoon** winds. A local **Jet Stream** of **Somali Jet** strengthens high Pressure near **Madagascar** which causes the faster flow of winds towards **India**. The temperature stratification in the air does not allow upward movement of air preventing major storms. The **tropical Easterly Jet Stream** which is a low-level **Jet Stream** developed over **South Asia** and **Africa** between **5° to 20 ° North** in Summer causes the change of divergence to convergence on the surface. In addition to this, the formation of local depressions in the **Bay of Bengal** also helps in the bursting of the monsoon. These monsoon winds gradually get distributed all over **India**.
    - **Autumn Condition**: **ITCZ** starts to move back gradually towards the South. This also brings back the maximum extent up to which **South West** winds blow. The **South West** winds gradually get replaced by **North East** winds. **Sub-tropical Westerly Jet stream** reappears creating dry conditions. The high temperature with dry conditions in **October** along the **Northern Plains** is called as **October heat**.

- **Characteristics of Monsoon**: The onset of monsoon is gradual and withdrawal is more gradual. Rainfall during the **Southwest monsoon** decreases from Sea to land. Temporal Variations that is variations of rainfall with time and the same location. Spatial variation: Variation of the rainfall from one region to another at a particular time.

- **Break in a monsoon**: In some regions, due to local stability conditions temperature stratification reappears resulting in a break in the monsoon. **IT** may also be due to winds blowing parallel to topography.

- **Western Disturbances**: **Western Disturbance** is active along **North-Western India** between **November to April**. During winter, **Northern India** experiences cold and dry winds along with a strong **Westerly Jet Stream**. The **Mediterranean** receives rainfall during this season due to on-shore **Westerlies** and temperate cyclones. The **subtropical Westerly Jet Stream** along the **Mediterranean** region picks up the moisture content and low-pressure disturbances and is brought to **India**. When these winds accumulate near **North Western Himalayas**, it causes precipitation. The Precipitation due to **Western Disturbance** decreases from West to East along the **Ganga plains**.

- **Significance of Western disturbances**: It causes an abrupt decrease in temperature and snowfall along the **Northern hills**. It causes good crops of **Wheat** and **mustard**. It may cause cloud bursts and flash floods. For example, the **Leh cloud bursts** of **2010**.

- **Changes observed in Indian Monsoon**:
    - **Delay in onset**: Every year since **2002**, Delay in retreat, increase in number of breaks, decrease in average **Monsoon Precipitation**, Increase in Temporal and spatial variations.
    - **Possible reasons**: Global changes in temperature and pressure conditions due to global warming. Sea surface temperature variations. Decrease in monsoon depressions in the **Bay of Bengal**, Increase the impact of **El-Nino** and **IOD**. Increase in aerosols such as **Black carbon** which absorbs heat and may reduce cloud formation.

- **Soils of India**:
    - **Factors affecting soil**:
        - **Parent Rock material**: For example, **Granite** and **Gneiss** resulted in the formation of red soil.
        - **Climate**: High rainfall and Temperature in the **Western Ghats** have resulted in **Laterite soil**. Low rainfall in **Rajasthan** has resulted in saline soil. The soils of **Central India** are rich in humus than the soils of dry regions of **Karnataka** and **Maharashtra**.
        - **Topography**: The **Himalayan** soils are very thin than the soils of the **Northern plains**. **Khadar** and **Bangar** soil.

- **Characteristics of Indian soil**: All **Indian** soils are deficient in nitrogen. All major soils are deficient in Humus content except three soils (mountain soil, black soil, and peaty soil). Both red and laterite soil are rich in iron.
    1. **Red soil**: Moderate to low precipitation. Parent Rock material: **Granite** and **Gneiss**. It is rich in iron, aluminium, and magnesium. It is deficient in Nitrogen, Humus, and phosphorus.
    2. **Black soil**: It is black due to the presence of titaniferous magnetite. Parent Rock material: **Basaltic magma** of **Deccan trap**, it is rich in humus content. It is deficient in phosphorus. Highly permeable therefore holds water. It develops cracks during summer and becomes sticky during rain therefore it is called **self-ploughing soil**.
    3. **Laterite soil**: High temperature and Precipitation cause heavy leaching. It is rich in iron and Aluminium. It is deficient in silica, bases, humus, etc. It is good for plantation crops.
    4. **Alluvial soils**: No marked differences in layers. It is deficient in nitrogen and humus.
    5. **Arid** or **desert soil**: High evaporation and low precipitation. Salinization is highly active. It is rich in sodium salt.
    6. **Mountain** and **Forest soil**: Thin layer, Rich in organic matter that is humus content. It is acidic in nature due to slow decomposition.
    7. **Peaty soil**: Found in water-logged conditions along the Deltas. It is rich in humus content.

- **Soil Erosion**: The removal of the top layer of soil causing it to lose fertility is called as soil erosion. It is mainly caused by the action of water and wind.

- **Causes of soil erosion**:
    - **Natural causes**: In dry regions, deflation causes wind erosion. Mountainous region with a steep slope and high precipitation.
    - **Anthropogenic causes**: Overgrazing, Deforestation, Mining, over-irrigation
        - Construction, shifting cultivation, Use of chemical fertilisers.

- **Four different stages of erosion**:
    1. **Sheet erosion**: It involves removal of thin layer of topsoil.
    2. **Rill erosion**: In the next stage, finger-shaped rills are developed due to the increased flow of water.
    3. **Gully erosion**: Deep gullies developed causing heavy loss of soil. For example, **Chambal Wetlands**.
    4. **Slip erosion**: The entire top layer is washed away.

- **Soil erosion regions of India**:
    - **Himalayas**- deforestation and other human activities.
    - **Northeast**- heavy rainfall, Shifting cultivation, steep topography.
    - **Punjab** and **Haryana**- Faulty irrigation practice.
    - **Rajasthan**- wind erosion due to deflation.
    - **Central India**- Mining, deforestation, Precipitation.
    - **Western Ghats**: Construction activities, overgrazing, deforestation, Precipitation.
    - **Chambal**- lack of vegetation, Mining activities etc.

    - Distribution of **Poly-Metallic nodules**: it is concentrated only in a few regions of the ocean. For example, **Clarion-Clipper Ton Zone**, **Peru Basin**, near **Cook Island** in the **Pacific**, **Central**, and **Southern Indian Ocean**. The Presence of **PMN** is in too dark, too deep, and too cold regions.
    - The issue of the high cost of extraction: For example, Freshwater, and minerals.
    - Physical barriers:
        - Environmental issues: Oil spills, Destruction of coral reefs, Thermal Pollution, Fishing.

- **Water Resources**:
    - **Issues**: Water pollution reduces the availability of good quality water for human consumption. Uneven distribution due to the topography (plains, mountains, plateaus, rain shadow regions, etc.). Example:
(image of Distribution of Earth's Water)
    - **Aravallis**, rain shadow effect of western ghats, Coromandal coast, etc. Nature of monsoon-i.e. short duration and irregular. Nature of **India's drainage system** i.e., **Himalayan** rivers are perennial and peninsular rivers are seasonal.
    - **Anthropological**: Increased population resulting in higher demand of water; poor management of water; faulty agricultural practices; encroachment of wetlands and water bodies, excessive extraction of groundwater, Deforestation, Climate change, administrative issues like river sharing disputes, etc.
    - **Water stress**: The maximum use of surface water is for agriculture (**89%**) followed by Domestic use (**9%**) and Industrial use (**2%**).
    - **Groundwater**: Maximum use is for agriculture (**92%**) followed by Industrial use (**5%**) and Domestic use (**3%**). **Falken mark index** gives the status of water stress from different countries. It measures water stress in terms of water/person/year. If a country's water availability is less than **1700 m3/person/year** then it is a water stress country. If a country reaches a level of less than **1000 m3/person/year** then it becomes a water scare country. **54%** of **India** faces high to extremely high-water stress. The average annual per capita water availability in **2011** was assessed as **1545 cubic meters**.
        - **Southern Region**: Rain shadow effect; Plateau region: less percolation of water and no major river available; Rapid urbanization like in **Bangalore**, **Hyderabad**, **Chennai**, etc.
        - **Western India**: Scarcity of rainfall; urbanization, pollution along the coastal region, western intensive crops like sugarcane in **Maharashtra**,
        - **Northern India**: Faulty irrigation, High pollution, low Rainfall, topography, deforestation, water intensity crops, excessive extraction of groundwater, high density of population, etc.
        - **Eastern India**: High population, pollution, extraction of groundwater in **West Bengal** leading to **Arsenic**, mining activities and deforestation in **Chhattisgarh**, **Jharkhand**, etc,
        - **North-East**: The only region where the water stress is absent, but in the future, there can be water stress due to topography and extraction.

- **Water Management**: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Pollution Control, Reforestation and Afforestation.
    - **Watershed Development**: **Watershed** in any area where all of the water under it or drains of it collects into one water body. It implies rational utilization of land and water resources for optimum and sustained production with minimum hazard to natural resources. It involves the conservation and management of both surface and groundwater using a watershed as a single unit.

- **World Agriculture Regions**
    - **Tropical types**
        - **Nomadic Herding** It is the simplest form of pastoralism. The population primarily depends on animals rather than crops for purposes like meat, milk, wool, skin etc. They keep moving from one place to another. This is followed in regions which are developing in nature, and primitive agriculture is practised. The practice of movement of people along with their animals from one region to another is called **Transhumance**.
        - **Animals**: Camels in **North Africa** and the **Middle East**, Horses: in **Central Asia**, Yak and Lama: **Tibet**, **China**, **Mongolia**, Sheep and Goats in the **Semi-arid regions**. E.g. (**India**): **Gaddis**, **Gurjars**, **Bakharwals** etc.
        - **Shifting Agriculture**, A patch of forest is cut down and cultivated with a very primitive form of agriculture for a few years. The patch of forest as it becomes relatively less productive after **2-3 years** is burnt, considering it shall lead to rejuvenation of the nutrients of the soil. Though it leads to extensive nutrient loss once the patch is left burnt and un-cultivated. It requires a very large area of forest and the land is community owned.
        - **Regions**: **Amazon**, **Venezuela**, **Congo**, **Mexico**, **Western Africa**, **South East Asia**, **North East India** (**Jhum Cultivation**, **Sri Lanka**.
        - **Intensive Subsistence Agriculture**: It is dominated by rice cultivation. Small and highly fragmented land holding because of high population density, and dominant role of manual labour. Practiced in areas of fertile land. Followed in developing countries where multiple cropping is followed to maximise the yield. E.g. **Cauvery Delta region** (three crops of rice in one year). High agriculture productivity, but low per capita production.
        - **Regions**: **South Asia**: regions of **River Plains** and **Deltas**, **South East Asia**, **Eastern China**.
        - **Plantation Agriculture**: Establishment of large estates requires high capital. It is the only commercial method of agriculture in Tropical regions. Highly centralised, and mainly export-oriented. Scientifically managed, Dominant manual labour. It has resulted in a huge degree of migration, forced migration, voluntary migration as well as slave trade.

- **India's Agriculture**:
    - **Green Revolution**: Inputs used in **Green Revolution**:
        - **High Yielding Variety seeds** (**HYV**): They are not indigenous, but rather developed through biotechnological interventions. These seeds grow fast, mature early, and are short growing but dense. Higher productivity in means of output.
    - **Drawbacks**: Excessive requirement of water, thus required irrigation facilities
        - Require excessive chemical fertilizers, as they deplete the soil nutrients at a higher pace. They are more prone to disease and pests and thus require chemical pesticides. Higher capital, which led to the State support in terms of loans and **MSP** (**Minimum Support Price**).
    - **The Green Revolution was implemented in three phases**:
        - (i) **Pre-mature phase 1961-1968**: Integrated Agriculture Development. Programme was undertaken, where eight districts of **Punjab** and **Haryana** were targeted.
        - (ii) **Mature Phase 1968-1981**: Entire **Punjab**, **Haryana** and **Western UP** were targeted. By the end of this phase the food production reached **150Mn Tonnes**.
        - (iii) **Third Phase 1981-1992**: i.e. The **Rice Revolution**: Specifically, targeted rice growing regions.
    - **Implications**:

- **Eight types of rocks**:
    1. **Archean**: These are very old primary rocks, they are the oldest and deepest of all. They are largely metamorphic hard rocks. They form the fundamental complex of the country. They contain no fossils and no economically valuable minerals, found near the surface. Example- found near **Bundelkhand** and **Nilgiris**.
    2. **Dharwar**(**Karnataka**): These are the oldest sedimentary rock layers. Very rich in metalliferous minerals such as iron, manganese, gold, silver, etc. It contains no fossils, made up of a mixture of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Example- found in **Dharwar**, **Chotanagpur**, **Aravalli**.
    3. **Cuddapah** (**Andhra Pradesh**): It is due to erosion and deposition of **Dharwar** and **Archean** rocks. They are found along near the basin of **Andhra Pradesh** near **Krishna Valley**. The minerals found are limestone, dolomite, and glass making sand.
    4. **Vindhayan**: These are block mountains formed due to rifting activities. Minerals found here are limestone, sandstone, and Diamond (**Panna mine** and **Golconda mine**)
    5. **Gondwana**: They are formed during the upper carboniferous period. They are majorly found around the rift valleys of **Damodar**, **Son**, **Mahanadi**, and **Godavari**. They contain stratified rocks with fossils. They contain the major coal deposits of **India**.
    6. **Deccan traps**: They are formed due to the eruption of basaltic magma. When the **Indian plate** was moving towards the **Eurasian plate** and encountered a **reunion hotspot**. It has resulted in the formation of an extensive step Plateau along the **Western ghats**, **Vidarbha regions**, **Northern Karnataka**, parts of **Telangana**, **Western Madhya Pradesh**, and **Gujarat**. The presence of titaniferous magnetite has resulted in the formation of black soil which is favourable for the cultivation of cotton and sugarcane.
    7. **Tertiary**: Formed due to the collision of the **Indian plate** and the **Eurasian plate**. It includes the entire **Himalayas** and they are devoid of metallic minerals.
    8. **Quaternary**: It is the deposition of sediments derived from the **Himalayan** rivers. It covers the great **Northern plains**.

- **Issues related to the mining of minerals**:
    - **Environmental issues**- Air pollution caused by open cast mining, water pollution due to seepage of chemicals and disturbance of groundwater resources, soil pollution due to deforestation, and land degradation. Loss of vegetation, loss of biodiversity, and increased soil erosion.
    - **Administrative issues**- illegal mining, damage to infrastructure, revenue loss, displacement of people, migration, regional disparity.
    - **Health issues**- Due to lack of safety precautions, technology-related (old methods), low efficiency, and productivity. **Rat hole mining**- In **Meghalaya**. **Sand mining**- Illegal in **India**, due to corruption.

- **Shale gas extraction**:
    - **Fracking**- Water is pumped at a high pressure which causes a local explosion due to which rock releases shale gas and then it is extracted.
    - **Issues**- Huge quantity of water, large land is required, water is polluted as it is mixed with chemicals, contamination of groundwater, the rock layers may get disturbed and health issues associated with extraction.

- **Industries**:
    - **Manufacturing**- The production of identical goods on large scale using raw material, machinery, power, and specialized labour in a factory set to produce standardized commodities.
    - **Locational factors**:
        - **Raw material**- Easily available, cheaply available, and easy to transport. Weight losing (for example steel industry near iron ore found) and non-weight losing (cotton). Perishable raw materials (dairy products) are non-perishable (beans, sugar).
        - **Market**- Bigger the market more the profit, competition, and distance.
        - **Labour**- Skilled and unskilled, available, cheap.
        - **Energy**- Regular power and at a cheap cost.

        - **Government policy**- Easy acquisition and cheap land, tax incentives, better industrial policy.
    - **Footloose industry**- An industry that is not dependent on a specific raw material and can be obtained anywhere. Government policy is the most important factor here. Example **IT industry**.
    1. **Cotton Textile industry**: Largest agro-based industry in **India**.
        - They are of three types - handloom, power loom & mill.
        - Non-weight loose and easy to transport, Cheap labour and semi-skilled labour.
        - Most dominating factor- the fashion industry, large demand, Requires good transportation factory.
        - **Distribution**- Started in **Mumbai** (the first mill was established in **1854**). Important Centre- **Mumbai**, **Pune**, **Surat**, **Solapur**, **Vadodara**, **Gandhi Nagar**, etc.
        - The first spread happened in **Tamil Nadu** & then the South.
        - **reasons**- black soil, cheap power, labour is much cheaper than in the north, **Coimbatore** is called **Manchester of South India** and **Tirupur**, **Salem**, **Chennai**, **Bangalore**.
        - The second shift happened toward the northern plain- **reasons**- market, cheaper labour, port facility in **West Bengal**, alluvial soil.
        - **Centres**- **Kanpur**, **Agra**, **Mathura**, **Banaras**, **Bhopal**, **Kolkata**, etc.
        - **Issues**- Irregular supply of cotton, cotton is not of superior quality, too much dependent upon **Bt cotton**, etc. Competition in terms of raw materials, producers like **Bangladesh** and **Vietnam** giving tough competition. Irregular power and costly. The largest producer of cotton in **China**, the **USA**, **Egypt**, **Uzbekistan**, the biggest market for cotton is **Europe** and **India** exports maximum to **Germany**.
    2. **Jute**- **Textile Industry**:
        - **Locational factors**: The raw material is non-weight losing. Require abundant water from **Hugli**. Cheap Labour from **Odisha**, **Bihar**. Regular power.
        - **Important centres**- **Rishra 1855**, **Kolkata**, **Howrah**, **serampur** etc.
        - Over some time, these industries shifted to **Andhra Pradesh** for rice, **UP** for Sugar, and **MP** for cement packaging.
        - **Problems**- Not good quality of raw material. Competition from **Bangladesh** and Plastic. Frequent strikes and lockouts. Lack of modern technology. Steps were taken- Mandatory jute packaging.
        - **Significance**: Environmentally friendly. Called a golden fibre. Generates employment. The highest producer in the world.
    3. **Silk Textile industry**: All five types of silk are being found and produced in **India**.
        - **Mulberry silk** (most produced)- **Tamil Nadu**, **Karnataka** (largest producer), **Kerala**.

        - **Tropical Tussar**- **Jharkhand**, **Chhatisgarh**, **Odisha**.
        - **Problems**: Irregular supply of raw material. The price of silk is low for farmers and no price support. A large number of middlemen. Competition from other countries like- **China**. Artificial silk.
        - **Significance**: It has historical importance, the silk route passed through **India** as well. It is part of exports from age-old times. **Sericulture** has huge potential for employment. Source of income for rural women.
    4. **Sugar Industry**: Second larger agro-based industry. Weight-losing raw material. Too bulky to transport. Established in sugar-producing states.
        - **Distribution**- First they were established in **North India**- **Punjab**, **UP**, and **Bihar**.
        - **Important Centres**- **Saharanpur**, **Meerut**, **Faizabad**, **Sitapur**, **Chamranpur**, **Muzaffarpur**, **Ambala**, **Hissar**, **Patiala**, etc. Slowly it shifted to the South (**60%** produce) i.e. **Maharashtra**, **Karnataka**, and **Tamil Nadu**.
        - **Reasons**: **Delta region**- **Kaveri**, **Godavari**. **Black Soil**. Higher productivity because of the marine effect. The sucrose content is high. Longer crushing period. Ports help in the export of sugar and the import of machines. A lot of cooperatives. **Pune**, **Kolhapur**, **Nasik**, **Shimoga**, **Belgaum**, **Trichi**, **Coimbatore**, **Coastal Andhra Pradesh**.
        - **Issues**: Overall productivity is less compared to the world average. It is water intensive. lack of modern technology. Competition within **India** from **Gur** & **Khandsari**. Prices are not remunerative.
    5. **Iron** and **steel industry**: Highest weightage to raw material produced on large scale. It is a weight-losing industry one-third. Iron and coal, limestone, manganese, water for cooling, cheap skilled, and abundant labour. Regular power in large quantity.
        - **Transportation**- railway (**Bi-directional relationship** between iron and coal). Capital. Long gestation period.
        - **10 Integrated steel plants** were set up by the government: **West Bengal**- **Durgapur** and **Burnpur**. **Jharkhand**- **Bokaro** & **Jamshedpur**. **Odisha**- **Rourkela**. **Chhatisgarh**- **Bhilai**. **Maharashtra**-**Bhadrawati** & **Vijayanagar**. **Andhra Pradesh**- **Vizag**. **Tamil Nadu**- **Salem**.
        - **Mini steel plant**- Set up near urban regions and use scrap to produce steel. Short gestation period, smaller capital, nearness to market. Shortage of raw material, informal waste collection system, dependent upon the import of scrap, shortage of power. **Pittsburgh** (now called rust bowl), the **Ural region** in **Russia**, **Europe**, **UK** & **France**.
        - **Problems**: Hughes capital is needed. Bulky to transport. Huge power is needed. Lack of modern technology. Requires skilled labour.
    6. **Cement industry**: One of the core industries. Raw material- Limestone, gypsum, and coal. **Cuddapah**, regions & **Vindhayan** regions produce limestone, **Shivalik** near **Doon valley**. Coal- **Gondwana**. Gypsum- **Rajasthan**. Slag- Steel plants, Sludge from fertilizer plants both are good sources of Gypsum. At present cement plants are getting distributed everywhere due to government policies.
    7. **Fertilizer industry**: Classified as three types:
        - **Nitrogenous**: **Naphtha** - Produced from the petroleum industry (a liquid mixture of hydrocarbon), refineries also **India** imports **Naphtha**. Ammonium sulphate is also used which is available in **Guj**, **Tamil Nadu**, **Andhra Pradesh**, etc. Centre- **Chennai**, **Cochin**.
        - **Phosphatic Fertilizer**- Come from rock phosphate, **Rajasthan**, **Andhra Pradesh**, **Jharkhand**, and also imported.
        - **Sulphurous**- Sulphuric acid is available from refineries.

- **Transportation**:

| Roadways | Railways | Waterways | Airways |
|---|---|---|---|
| Last mile connectivity, Intra/inter-state carries goods, Used in Difficult terrain | Bulky material/Goods, Support industries /growth, Comfortable, labour-intensive. | Cheapest, Environment friendly, low capital required, Low energy, labour-intensive | Fastest. Transportation of perishable goods. To cover the long distance |

- **Disadvantages**: Convert advantages of others into disadvantages of others.

| Seasonal |
|---|
| Building of Dams for irrigation |
| Not navigable |
| Siltation, Shifting of the river course |

## Human geography
- **Terms related to population**. A population is a group of individuals belonging to the same species.
    - **Population density**- Area in which they are living Population/Area.
    - **Factors**:
        - **High**- Riverine plain areas, Coastal areas, Areas of economic opportunities
        - Administrative regions
        - **Low**- Hilly, desert, waterlogged, or thick forest areas.
    - **Natural growth rate**: It will not consider the impact of migration.
    - No. of live birth - no. of deaths/ mid-year population) X **1000**.
    - **Crude birth rate**: (No. of live births/mid-year population) X **1000**.
    - How much the entire population is reproducing.
    - **Fertility rate**: population (**0 to 4**)/ female population (**15 to 49**) X **1000**.
    - **Replacement level fertility**: The average number of children a woman would need to have to reproduce herself by barring a daughter who survives to child barring age so that each. the generation will exactly replace itself without considering migration. It is generally considered to be **2.1**.
    - **IMR**: Death (**0 to 1 age**) / live birth.
    - **MMR**: Death/Live birth per **1 lakh**.

- **Migration**: Change in the residence temporarily for a substantial duration of time.
    - **Types**-
        - **Internal**:
            1. Rural to Urban- Work.
            2. Urban to Urban- Opportunity.
            3. Urban to rural- Lockdown.
            4. Rural to rural- marriage.
        - **International**:
            1. Forced
            2. Voluntary
    - **Causes**:
        - **Push factors**: Famine, drought, lack of living.
        - **Pull factor**: better opportunity.
    - The graphical representation of the population composition of a country. These three types- Progressive, stationary, and contracting.
