    - Allegation of political interference

  - **Recommendations**
    - 2ND ARC - repeal OSA adding provisions in NATIONAL SECURITY ACT, 1980
    - The definition of "secret" needs to be clearly defined in the OSA
- **Recent amendments**
  - Change in term - central govt will determine (earlier it was 6 yrs or <65 age)
