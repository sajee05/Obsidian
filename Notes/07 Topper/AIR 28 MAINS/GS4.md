    -   As PLATO said, 'Ethics is nothing else than reverence for good life.'
-   In conclusion, we can heed to words of ARISTOTLE, he said that neither the principles nor the consequence but a reasoned combination of both makes a good moral judgement.

## Doctrine of Double Effect

-   If doing something morally good has morally bad side-effects, its okay to do, provided that bad side effect wasn't intended.

-   I sincerely believe in the words of DR. A.P.J. ABDUL KALAM. Corruption which is misuse of public office or position for personal gain is manifestation of erosion of ethics. For a society to become corruption free ethical development is of paramount importance.

        -   Lack of Transparency and accountability
            -   Coal and Fodder Scam
        -   Weak law enforcement : does not create legal deterrence
