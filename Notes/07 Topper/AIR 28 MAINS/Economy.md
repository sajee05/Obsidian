#### Airports
- India third largest aviation market with air traffic growing at least 16% per year
- UDE DESH KA AAM NAAGRIK (UDAN) Scheme
- National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) 2016
- **Key Components of the Airports Sector:**
    - Major International Airports
    - Regional Airports
    - Greenfield Airports
    - Airport Infrastructure: Includes runways, terminals, air traffic control (ATC) systems, and ground services.
    - Cargo Handling Facilities: Infrastructure for handling and processing air cargo efficiently.
- **Challenges in the Airports Sector:**
    - Capacity Constraints : operate at or beyond capacity
    - Financial Viability
        - _Example:_ Many regional airports struggle to generate sufficient revenue to cover operational costs.
    - Slow adoption of advanced technologies
        - _Example:_ Limited implementation of automated check-in and baggage handling systems.
    - Environmental Impact : contribute to noise, air pollution, and habitat disruption.
    - Service Quality : like cleanliness, accessibility, and customer service.
        - _Example:_ Passenger complaints about long wait times
    - Infrastructure Deficits :
    - Regulatory Hurdles
        - _Example:_ Delays in environmental clearances and land acquisition for airport projects.
- **Recommendations for Improvement:**
    - Capacity Expansion
        - construction of greenfield airports
    - Modernization of Facilities: Upgrade terminals, runways, and other facilities
    - Financial Models
        - (PPPs) to enhance investment
    - Technological Advancements:
        - _Example:_ Implementation of biometric boarding systems and advanced ATC technologies.
    - Environmental Sustainability
        - _Example:_ Using solar power for airport operations and implementing green building standards.
    - Enhanced Safety and Security
        - Biometric verification, increasing security personnel

#### Investment Models
- **Introduction**
    - Investment - an act or undertaking with the expectation of a worthwhile result.
- **Need for Investment**
- **Sources of Investment**
- **Types of Investment Models**
    - Domestic Investment Models
        - Public Investment Model : Government funds projects directly
            - _Example_: Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)
- Private Investment Model
    - Equity Financing: Private companies raise capital by issuing shares to investors.
    - Venture Capital and Private Equity: Investments in startups and private firms
    - Corporate Bonds: Corporations issue bonds to fund expansion and projects
    - Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)
    - Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
    - Angel Investors and Incubator
- Foreign Investment Models:
    - FDI
    - FII, etc
- Sector Specific Investment Models
    - Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)
        - _Example_: ONGC's investments in the energy sector.
- Cluster Based Investment Models
- Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs): Government forms entities to execute specific projects.
    - _Example_: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for urban transportation.
- **PPP in Railways**
    - Modernization of Infrastructure
        - Rani Kamlapati RS in Bhopal
    - Improved Passenger Amenities
        - clean and spacious waiting areas, better sanitation, and improved accessibility.
    - professional management practices ensuring high standards of cleanliness and service.
    - PPPs help in generating non-fare revenue through commercial development of station premises.
        - Retail spaces, restaurants, and office complexes
    - Costs sharing of redevelopment
    - Focus on passenger comfort and convenience leads to a better travel experience.
- **Investment Models Followed by India**
- **Public Private Participation Investment Model (PPP)**
    - Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is a collaborative investment model between government and private entities to finance, build, and operate projects.
    - PPPs aim to leverage private sector efficiency and public sector oversight.
- **Type of PPP Models**
    - Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT): Private sector builds the infrastructure, operates it for a specified period, and then transfers it to the government.
        - _Example_: National Highways developed under the BOT model.
    - Design-Build-Finance-Operate (DBFO): Private entity designs, builds, finances, and operates the project, often involving complex projects.
        - _Example_: Mumbai Metro Line 1.
    - Lease-Develop-Operate (LDO): Government leases an existing facility to a private entity, which upgrades and operates it.
    - Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT): Private sector builds, owns, operates, and then transfers the project after a set period.
    - EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) - 100% government finance
    - PPP Annuity
    - PPP Toll
    - BOO (Build–Own–Operate)
    - BOT Annuity
        - private entity receives fixed payments (annuities) from the government instead of tolls collected from users
    - DBFOT -(Design-Build-Operate-Transfer)
    - HAM (Hybrid Annuity Model) -
        - EPC + BOT-Annuity
        - Payment structure
            - (40% payment- during construction) + (60% payment as annuity after construction).
        - Risk sharing
            - Construction Risk: pvt + govt
            - Revenue Risk : govt
    - Highways
        - Operate Maintain Transfer (OMT)
        - Toll Operate Transfer (TOT)
    - Airports
        - Operations, Maintenance & Development (OMD)
- **Factors** to consider while designing an concessional agreement
    - Objectives, scope, and deliverables of the project, timeline for completion
    - Financial arrangements: Investment costs, revenue-sharing mechanisms, pricing mechanisms
    - Performance Standards about service quality, maintenance, and safety and it's monitoring mechanisms
    - Termination Clauses
    - Tariff and Pricing Mechanisms : protect consumers and ensure reasonable returns for private investors
    - Dispute resolution mechanism
    - Risk allocation like construction delays, cost overruns, and demand fluctuations
        - _Example:_ PPP model in highways often allocates demand risk to the private party.
    - Performance standard
    - Monitoring mechanism
- **Role in Development | Advantages**
    - mobilization of private sector capital reduce fiscal burden on government
    - private sector brings in efficiency, technical expertise, and innovation in project execution and management.
    - Risk sharing : like cost overruns and delays in construction, operation, and maintenance
    - Faster and timely project completion due to private sector efficiency in project execution
    - improved quality due to performance-based contracts
    - Clearly defined contracts and performance metrics enhance accountability and transparency
- **Challenges**
    - Long gestation period (15-30 yrs.) - transfer unsuitable labilities to the future
    - Complex project structuring : time-consuming process, legal, financial, and technical considerations.
    - Political and policy risks : shifts in policy direction can disrupt the long term viability
    - Securing long-term financing
    - Transparency, fairness, and accountability
    - Enforcing and monitoring the contract
- **Measures**
    - Vijay Kelkar committee
        - Establishment of **independent regulatory agency**
        - Zero coupon bonds
        - Infrastructure PPP Adjudication Tribunal (**IPAT**)

        - ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economy 3.jpeg]]
- Long-term planning and risk assessment
- Clearly outline the responsibilities and obligations throughout project lifecycle

- **Conclusion**
    - PPP can change our infrastructure model from Build-Neglect-Rebuild to Build-Nurture-Repair (Rakesh Mohan Committee)
        - ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economy 4.jpeg]]
    - Overall, PPPs can be a valuable tool for modernizing India's infrastructure. Vijay Kelkar committee recommendations should be considered for reaping full benefits of this model.
