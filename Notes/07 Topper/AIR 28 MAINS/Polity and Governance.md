    - Issues
        - CBI and Federalism
            - The Police are under List II, i.e., it is exclusively a **state subject**. However, CBI act as police encroaches upon state jurisdiction.
                - Saradha Chit Fund scam - standoff between CBI and Kolkata Police
            - Often allegedly used for means to target leaders of opposition parties.
                - Tamil Nadu excise minister V SENTHIL BALAJI
                - 2G spectrum case
            - Withdrawal of special consent by states

                - E.g. over 100 complaints of suspected high-value fraud are pending due to lack of consent
            - Parallel Investigations
                - SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT case : Mumbai Police and CBI
        - Frequent Changes in Investigative Priorities : raise question on neutrality
            - ISHRAT JAHAN case
        - Inconsistencies in high profile cases
            - Vyapam scam - delay and inaction
        - Supreme Court described the CBI as “a caged parrot speaking in its master’s voice” (Politicization of CBI).
            - Coal Allocation Scam
        - Selective Investigations Based on Political Relevance
        - Piecemeal extension of tenure at government's wish - undermines institutional integrity
        - Overlapping Function : CVC, Lokpal and CBI
        - Transparency Issues : CBI is exempted from the purview of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005.

    - Measures
        - Institutional Reforms : statutory or constitutional status
            - Independence and autonomy
        - Strengthening Legal Framework
            - Supreme Court’s directive in the VINEET NARAIN case (1997)
        - Financial and Administrative Autonomy
        - Accountability Mechanisms : parliamentary committee oversight
        - Internal Capacity and Professionalism : infrastructure, technology, and manpower
        - Judicial Oversight
            - Supreme court and the high court can order CBI to investigate any crime anywhere without consent
        - Cooperative federalism
        - However, a weak central authority could be injurious to national unity. Thus, it is imperative to have some agencies that have jurisdiction over the entire country.
    - Conclusion
        - With the surge in number of cyber fraud cases and economic offences, it is imperative that CBI remains empowered in larger public interest, but without being a **“caged parrot.”**
