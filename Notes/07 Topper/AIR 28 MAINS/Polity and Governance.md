Bodies \| Tribunals<br>        - Quasi-Judicial means having a partly judicial character, having the rights to hold hearing and conduct investigation in alleged infraction of rules and law, make decisions in general manner of court.<br><br>###### _Examples_<br><br>- - Tribunals under Article 323A and 323B<br>    - Election commission of India<br>    - National Human Rights Commission<br>    - National commission for SC, ST, BC.<br>    - National Commission for Women.<br>    - SEBI, TRAI<br><br>###### _Salient Features_<br><br>- - Directed by specific laws, specific purposes.<br>    - Binding judgement<br>    - Can be statutory, regulatory or constitutional in nature<br>    - Principles of natural justice<br>    - Indian evidence act : can go beyond the act<br><br>###### _Advantages_<br><br>- - Can disburse justice quickly<br>    - Low cost for the aggrieved<br>    - Leveraging expertise In certain matters<br>    - Ensure rights for specialized objectives, minorities and vulnerable sections.<br>    - Reduce the workload on over-burdened Judiciary.<br><br>###### _Disadvantages_<br><br>- - False Cases<br>    - Violates the principle of separation of power<br>    - Can become tools of unrestricted executive power if kept outside the jurisprudence of higher courts<br>    - Can become mechanism of parallel judicial process.<br>    - Lack resources and manpower.<br><br>###### _Way forward_<br><br>- - Tribunals are great ideas for addressing the challenges of contemporary judicial structure but the separation of power doctrine enshrined U/A 50 of constitution in DPSP shall be observed.

It derives it's powers Delhi Special Police Establishment **(DSPE) Act, 1946.**<br><br>- - General consent<br>        - **Section 5** of DSPE Act extends the powers and jurisdiction of special police establishments, including CBI, to other areas. **Section 6,** however, says that these powers cannot be exercised in the jurisdiction of another state without its consent.<br>    - Functions -<br>        - serious crimes related to the defence of India<br>        - Investigate corruption in high places<br>        - Economic crimes - fraud, cheating, black marketing, and profiteering in essential commodities.<br>        - High profile cases<br><br>- - Issues<br>        - CBI and Federalism<br>            - The Police are under List II, i.e., it is exclusively a **state subject**.

Judicial Oversight<br>            - Supreme court and the high court can order CBI to investigate any crime anywhere without consent<br>        - Cooperative federalism<br>        - However, a weak central authority could be injurious to national unity. Thus, it is imperative to have some agencies that have jurisdiction over the entire country.<br>    - Conclusion<br>        - With the surge in number of cyber fraud cases and economic offences, it is imperative that CBI remains empowered in larger public interest, but without being a **“caged parrot.”**<br><br>- -
