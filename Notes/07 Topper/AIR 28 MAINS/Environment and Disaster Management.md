||Vulnerability is the potential for damage due to disaster. It encompasses various dimensions, including physical, social, economic, and environmental aspects.<br><br>- Characterizing Vulnerability<br>    - Exposure : degree to which people, property, and infrastructure are located in disaster-prone areas.<br>    - Sensitivity : The degree to which people and systems are affected by hazards.<br>    - Resilience : ability to adapt and recover for impact of hazard<br>    - Coping capacity : resources and skills available to cope with disaster<br>- Types of Vulnerability<br>    - Physical :<br>        - Quality, location, and design of buildings and infrastructure<br>        - population density<br>    - Social :<br>        - Factors like age, gender, disability, and health status influencing capacities.<br>            - E.g. elderlies more prone<br>        - Levels of education and awareness<br><br>- Economic :<br>    - Low income levels<br>    - Dependence on vulnerable livelihoods like forest, agriculture, fishing<br>- Environmental :<br>    - Degradation of ecosystems such as deforestation, wetland loss<br>    - Changes in climate patterns<br>- Institutional : effectiveness of government agencies and institutions|
