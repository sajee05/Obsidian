4.  2014: The third battle of Panipat was fought in 1761. Why were so many empire-shaking battles fought at Panipat?
    1.  Panipat and its adjacent region, located in present Haryana on the banks of the Yamuna and between the fertile plains of the Ganga and Indus rivers, have witnessed several battles.
    2.  3 Battles were
        -   The first Battle of Panipat in 1526 was between BABUR and IBRAHIM LODI. The result of the battle laid the foundation of the MUGHAL EMPIRE by ending the rule of the DELHI SULTANATE.
        -   The Second Battle of Panipat in 1556 was between AKBAR and HEMU; it decided in favour of the continuation of the MUGHAL rule.
        -   The Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 between the MARATHAS and AHMAD SHAH ABDALI put an end to the MARATHA ambition of ruling over India
    3.  Why Panipat was a favourite battle field
        1.  Panipat had a strategic location. One of the parties of the war generally came from the north/northwest through the KHYBER PASS to get hold over Delhi, the political capital of northern India. To move a military through rough terrains—deserts of Rajasthan or the other northern areas infested with dense forests—was very risky and difficult. On the other hand, the rulers at Delhi considered Panipat as a confrontable strategic ground and hence they preferred to take the fight there.
        2.  Its proximity to Delhi made it easier for the Indian rulers to transport weapons, military and food supplies etc., to the battleground, and still keep the capital insulated from the conflict at hand.
        3.  Panipat’s surrounding region has a flat ground which was suitable for cavalry movement—the main mode of warfare at the time.
        4.  After the construction of the GRAND TRUNK ROAD by SHER SHAH SURI (1540-45), Panipat was on this route. It became easier for conquerors to find their way there.
        5.  The duration of monsoon rainfall in the region is short in comparison to other areas making it easier to fight.
        6.  The artisans/smiths of these regions were experts in making warfare-related materials and hence it became easier for forces of both parties to replenish their war materials.

    2.  2017: The women’s questions arose in modern India as a part of the 19th century social reform movement. What are the major issues and debates concerning women in that period?

## MAJOR EVENTS FROM 1757 TO 1857

2017: Clarify how mid-eighteenth century India was beset with the spectre of a fragmented polity

-   **Coming up of Europeans**
    -   **Portuguese** were the first to arrive in 1502. Factories at Calicut, Cochin, Goa, Dadra & NH, Daman & Diu
        -   Declined due to emergence of powerful dynasties such as Egypt/Persia/Maratha; Role played by Christian missionaries; diversion of interest to Brazil
        -   Lost at a battle with EIC in 1610s leading to confinement in few portions of India
    -   **Dutch** had settlements in Mausalipatnam/Petapuli, Pulicat, Negapatnam
        -   Declined after Anglo-Dutch war fought at Bedara (Bengal)
    -   **British** settled in various areas such as Surat, Madras, Bombay, Calcutta
    -   **French** came in 1667 and had factories at Surat, Pondicherry, Karaikal, etc.
        -   Fought 3 wars with EIC and got defeated in final battle at Wandiwash 1760s
-   **Reasons for decline of Mughals**
    -   Weak Successors such as FARRUKHSIYAR, MUHAMMAD SHAH. etc. Empire’s success depended upon a strong and capable monarch which was absent
    -   Absence of Definite Law of Succession led to continuous wars of succession (absence of law of primogeniture)
    -   Extravagant lifestyle of rulers, Endless wars, stagnation in agriculture, and decline in trade and industry emptied the royal treasury
    -   AURANGZEB’S Religious and Deccan Policies
        -   The religious policy antagonised the Rajputs, Sikhs, Jats and Marathas; Deccan policy kept the emperor away from the capital for a long duration
    -   External Invasions
        -   Invasions of Irani and Durrani kingdoms (NADIR SHAH, AHMAD SHAH ABDALI) gave a death-blow
    -   Rise of Regional Aspirations
        -   Rise and establishment of Awadh, Bengal, Hyderabad, Mysore, Kerala, Rajput states and Jat states accelerated the process of disintegration
    -   Too Vast an Empire
        -   The vast empire became a difficult task for weak rulers to administer efficiently
    -   Advent of Europeans
        -   European companies interfered in native politics, hastening the disintegration of empire
-   **State of fragmented polity**
    -   Cover point of weak state of mughal empire → highlight that there was virtually no central power like earlier days
    -   Rise of regional aspirations and coming up of europeans
    -   Fragmentation was used by invasions of ABDALI and NADIR SHAH
    -   The weakened Mughal Empire was challenged by Marathas time and again. Marathas captured vast swathes of territory in northern and central India
-   **British conquest until 1857**
    -   **Bengal**:
        -   **Reasons**: Use revenue from bengal to finance trade rather than bullions; Wanted to eliminate the dadani system where weavers had equal right to forfeit cash advance paid by EIC for goods procurement
        -   Battle of Plassey 1957 was conspiract and thus cannot be termed as real war but its impact was very real
            -   Example NARROJI calculated b/w 1757-80 around 38 mn pounds were fluxed out of India
            -   The wealth from bengal was used to fight future battles against europeans as well as domestic kingdoms
        -   Battle of Buxar 1964 was won by EIC due to military might and defeating the combined forces of bengal, awadh and mughals
            -   R. CLIVE introduced dual govt. in bengal which allowed them to enjoy power with responsibility
            -   Diwani was under EIC and Nizamat (other areas health, Law & order) were under Nizam
    -   **Mysore**:
        -   **Reasons**: Monopolise spice trade especially Malabar pepper; Control strategic passes such as Salem which connect east and west coast
        -   4 battles were fought of which 1st was won by Mysore; Finally conquered by WELLESLEY in 1799
    -   **Marathas**:
        -   **Reasons**: Marathas controlled black soil which was suitable for cotton; Best opium growing areas also under marathas; Control ports such as Salsette and Bassein
        -   3 battles were fought with final battle in 1818 by LORD HASTINGS
    -   **Sindh** was conqured in 1843 despite any provocation from Amirs of Sindh (war is considered as biggest ‘sin’)
    -   **Punjab**
        -   **Reasons**: PJ was route to Afghan; Doab lands of PJ
        -   2 battles were fought and finally conqured in 1849 by DALHOUSIE
    -   The process of imperial expansion by EIC during the 1757-1857 period through a two-fold method:
        -   Policy of annexation by conquest or war (covered above)
        -   Policy of annexation by diplomacy and administrative mechanisms: this included WARREN HASTINGS’ ‘ring-fence’ policy, WELLESLEY’S system of ‘subsidiary alliance’ and DALHOUSIE’S ‘doctrine of lapse’
            -   **Ring fence**: using neighbouring states to guard own interest eg: Awadh used to save Bengal
            -   **Subsidiary alliance**:
                -   **Features**: Accept permanent stationing of british troops, bear their expense, cannot employ other european w/o consent, cannot negotiate with other rulers.
                -   In return british will defend the ruler from his enemies eg: states such as Hyderabad, Sindhia, Mysore, Awadh, Jaipur, etc
            -   **Doctrine of lapse**:
                -   **Features**: Adopted son could be the heir to his foster father’s private property, but not the state; it was for the the British to decide whether to bestow the state on the adopted son or to annex it eg: Satara (1848) Sambhalpur (1849) Bhagat (1850) Udaipur (1850) Nagpur (1854) Jhanshi (1855) Awadh (1856; on charge of mal-administration)
-   **Pre 1857 Interferences of the British in Indian tradition and customs**: Banning Sati, Imposition of taxes on mosque and temple, Forcing army men to cross sea, LEXI-LOCI ACT allowed inheritance right to converts
-   **Post 1857** started using this rather than working against: Divide and rule, distinction of martial race and non-martial race, princes and big landlords as counter-weights; Divided moderates and extremists

## INDIAN RENAISSANCE - 19TH CENTURY

2019: Examine the linkages between 19th centuries ‘Indian renaissance’ and emergence of national identity (repeat in 2007, 1986)

-   Intellectual awakening by Renaissance, Printing press and communication channels, Unified system of administration, Economic critique brought people together, Racial discrimnation (eg: european judge > indian judge) in turn brought indians together

2017: The women’s questions arose in modern India as a part of the 19th century social reform movement. What are the major issues and debates concerning women in that period?

-   At the beginning of the 19th century, the condition of Indian women was not encouraging and suffered from various issues such as:
    -   **Issues**: Sati, child marriage, prohibition of widow remarriage, neglect of education, female infanticide, polygamy, dowry and the Devadasi system
    -   British considered abysmal state of women as white man’s burden and justified it by bringing various legislations. On the other hand, intellectuals began highlighting India’s golden past where women were treated with dignity
    -   There were movts to uplift social status of women however there was no equal emphasis on matters such as property & succession rights of women
    -   Lower caste under the effect of sanskritisation started imposing restrictions on their freedom of marriage, movement and social conduct. Thus even after legislations for widow remarriage there was no corresponding benefit
    -   Similarly, peasant families began to confine their women to household work because seclusion of women had become a symbol of higher castes. This led to stereotype that women workers are devoid of skills and reduced labour force participation
-   **Work done**:
    -   A Widow Remarriage Association was started in Bombay in 1866. Prof. D. R. KARVE founded the Widow Home in Poona in 1896. Efforts of ISHWAR CHANDRA VIDYASAGAR who opened nearly 35 girl’s schools in 1857- 58 in Bengal

-   **Features of Socio-Rel Movts.**
    -   The social reform movement did not, attack the social system as a whole; their attack was mainly only on the evils and malpractices that had crept into it eg: Idolatry, position of women, superstition, caste issues
    -   They were advocates of reform and not exponents of revolution. For them transformation was to be evolutionary, and not revolutionary
    -   Tools used were urban communication channels such as the press, lectures, and sabhas, propaganda network
    -   Spread of education and increased awareness of the world
    -   Consciousness of defeat by a foreign power gave birth to a new awakening

        -   MAHAD SATYAGRAHA 1927 by DR. DR AMBEDKAR (Chawdar Tank in MH)
-   **Contribution to national movt/awakening/national identity/other social reforms**
    -   India was ruled by central rulers before under AKBAR/ASHOKA however people identified themselves from regions rather than nation. It was only in the 19th Century that the concept of a national identity emerged
    -   Reformers asked people to evaluate socio-religious practices with rationality. For example, in the Brahmo Samaj, it led to the repudiation of the infallibility of the Vedas.
    -   These reform movements worked for the welfare of the lower castes and improving their status in the society. To purge untouchability, DAYANAND SARASWATI gave a utopian explanation for chaturvarna.
        -   BR AMBEDKAR efforts for social justice to make india a complete nation which take cares of its vulnerable sections
    -   Reformers tried to ameliorate the status of women in the society through reforms like the eradication of Sati, education of women, widow re-marriage, etc.
        -   Led to their empowerment and eventual role played in national movt.(esp gandhian phase)
    -   The soil for the growth of Indian nationalism and political awakening was prepared by these reform movements. For example, Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ram Krishan Mission and Theosophical Society
        -   Ideals of nationalism laid the foundation for political demands put fwd during the movt
    -   Spirit of self-reliance and determination. Reformation started by SWAMI DAYANAND, SWAMI VIVEKANANDA, ISHWAR CHANDRA VIDYA SAGAR and R.N.TAGORE gave a new life and a new spirit to the people of India.
    -   Reformers had done a lot of work in the field of education and opened many colleges and schools for Indian masses. For example, Hindu College, Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College etc.
        -   From moderates to extremists to revolutionary- all were educated with modern ideas of liberty, freedom etc
    -   Religious knowledge was disseminated through translation of religious texts into vernacular languages. Ordinary people also started interpreting scriptures, an acute departure from traditional religious dogmas.
    -   The reform movements were revivalist in a sense. The reformers aimed at modernisation rather than outright westernization
        -   This prevented breakage of social structure
    -   Renaissance ‘purified’ and ‘rediscovered’ an Indian civilisation that was conformant with the European ideals of rationalism, empiricism, monotheism and individualism. It was meant to show that Indian civilisation was by no means inferior to that of the West, rather in one sense, in its spiritual accomplishments it was even superior to it
        -   Gave ability to counter British idea that they were good for us
-   **Effects**
    -   **Positive** (PYQ: Mention social legislations by British)
        -   Bengal Regulation XVII of the Government, the custom of sati was declared illegal
        -   Widow Remarriage Act 1856
        -   Bengal Regulation delcared infanticide illegal
        -   The Age of Consent Act, 1891, raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse for all girls, married or unmarried, from ten to twelve years
        -   SHARDA ACT (Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929) fixed the age of marriage for girls at 14 years and boys at 18 years which was later amended to 18 for girls and 21 for boys
    -   **Negative/ Limitations of Socio religious movements**
        -   It had a narrow social base, namely the educated and urban middle classes, while the needs of vast masses of rural peasantry and the urban poor were ignored.
        -   The tendency of reformers to appeal to the greatness of the past, encouraged pseudo scientific thinking.
        -   Overemphasis on religious, philosophical aspects of culture while underemphasizing secular aspects led to the Hindus praising ancient Indian History and Muslims confining to the medieval history. This increased communal consciousness.
        -   Did not question the traditional role of women. They only wanted educated mothers and homemakers.
        -   It also alienated high caste Hindus from low caste Hindus as glorifying ancient period was not acceptable to the low caste sections of society which had suffered under religiously sanctioned exploitation.
        -   Caste distinctions remained strong and the religious and social practices did not die away.
        -   Internal rivalries lead to breakdown of many organisations. Ex: Brahmo Samaj divided itself into three wings after RAM MOHAN ROY. This lead to ineffective functioning.
        -   An overemphasis on religious and philosophical aspects of the cultural heritage got somewhat magnified by an insufficient emphasis on other aspects of culture art, architecture, literature, music, science and technology.
-   **Factors that helped to mitigate caste based discrimination**
    -   Policies of british indirectly, without intention, helped above. eg: equality before law, urbanisation, transportation, edu and admin were open to all castes
    -   Work done by social reforms movts such as Brahmo Samaj, Prarthana Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission and other indv worked to spread education among the untouchables and remove restrictions imposed on them from entering temples or using ponds, tanks
    -   National Movt got inspired from all this ideals and brought changes eg: Congress in 1937 made education free for harijans in some provinces, work done by GANDHIJI and
    -   With inc in education & awareness, there were awakening within lower castes themselves eg: JYOTIBA PHULE, BR AMBEDKAR, Self respect movt (one religion, one caste, one god), MAHAR SATYAGRAHA

## PEASANT/TRIBAL/CIVIL MOVEMENTS

2019: The 1857 Uprising was the culmination of the recurrent big and small local rebellions that had occurred in the preceding hundred years of British rule. Elucidate [Pre 1857 rebellions - Spectrum Chapter 6 (think in terms of PESTEL)] 'The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was not one movement …. it was many' - C.A. BAYLY

-   **Civil rebellions in British India**
    -   **Causes**:
        -   Major cause was the rapid changes brought by the British in the economy, administration and land revenue system. These changes led to the disruption of the agrarian society
        -   Intensified demand for for land revenue and extracting as large an amount as possible. The economic decline of the peasantry was reflected in twelve major and numerous minor famines from 1770 to 1857
        -   The new courts and legal system encouraged the rich to oppress the poor
        -   Thousands of zamindars and poligars lost control over their land
        -   The ruins of Indian handicraft industries, as a result of the imposition of free trade and discriminatory tariffs. The misery of the artisans was further compounded by the disappearance of their traditional patrons and buyers
    -   **Examples**:
        -   The FAQIR and SANYASI REBELLIONS, Bengal & Bihar (1770-1820s): ~50,000 participants involved at the height of insurgency. Resentment was due to harsh economic order and disastrous famine; Main leaders were MANJUM SHAH, DEBI CHAUDHRANI (ANANDMATH written by BANKIM C CHATTOPADHYAY)
        -   POLYGAR REBELLIONS, Andhra Pradesh (1799-1805): Polygars (feudal lords appointed as military chiefs; similar to Rajputs of North India) were joined by peasants against Company’s tactics and the rebellion reached a big scale before it was oppressed
        -   PAIKA REBELLION, Odisha (1817): An armed rebellion under the leadership of BAKSHI JAGABANDHU against the Company’s rule
-   **Tribal movements**
    -   **Causes**
        -   Imposition of land revenue settlement eroded the joint ownership and increased the socio-economic differentiation in the egalitarian structure of the tribal society
        -   Introduction of the notion of private property where land could be bought, sold, mortgaged which led to loss of land by the tribals
        -   Work of Christian Missionaries
        -   The establishment of the Forest department in 1864, Government Forest Act (1865) and Indian Forest Act in 1878 together established complete government monopoly over Indian forest land. Shifting Agriculture was banned from 1864 onwards on the reserved forest. Restrictions were imposed on the previously sanctioned timber and grazing facilities
        -   Extension of settled agriculture led to influx of non tribals in the tribal areas
        -   Some of the tribal uprising took place in reaction to the effect of the landlords to impose taxes on the customary use of timber and grazing facilities, police exaction, etc
        -   NE vs mainland movts: NE movts were not forest based as they had control over forests and british entered late in NE areas; NE revolts continued for a longer time compared to mainland movts. eg: MEITI MOVT continued as late as 1941
    -   **Examples**:
        -   **Mainland**:
            -   SANTHAL REBELLION: First phase was against economic exploitation by zamindars then turned anti-british. Under SINDHU and KANHA, the movement was to expel outsiders (Dikus) and Christian missionaries. Declared area between bhagalpur and rajmahal as autonomous
            -   MUNDA UPRISING: Munda rose up in rebellion seven times against the landlords, dikus, money lenders and the British, who instead of protecting them sided with the oppressors. The tribal chiefs rose up against the erosion of KHUNTKATTI SYSTEM or Joint tenures
            -   KOL UPRISING, Chhota Nagpur & Singhbhum region (1831-32): Transfer of lands from Kol to outsiders as well as oppressive british judicial/revenue policies. Leader was BUDDHO BHAGAT
        -   **North East**:
            -   AHOMS’ REVOLT (1828-33; Assam); against the non-fulfilment of the pledges of the Company after the Burmese War; the uprising was suppressed by the Company by dividing the kingdom
            -   KHASIS’ REVOLT (1830s; hilly region between Jaintia and Garo Hills); led by the Nunklow ruler, TIRATH SINGH; against the occupation of the hilly region
-   **Peasant movements**
    -   **Causes**:
        -   Unreasonably high rents in Ryotwari areas by the govt.
        -   Arbitrary evictions and unpaid labour in zamindari areas
        -   Harsh systems of the British. Ex: Forced cultivations of Indigo crop, Sunset clause, seizure of cattle and crops due to non- payment of loans etc.
        -   Transferability of land which deprived the traditional occupancy rights
        -   Lack of awareness of clauses leading to sudden loss of land and work, leading to collective uprisings
    -   **Examples**:
        -   **Pre 1857** - RANGPUR REBELLION (Bengal-1783; against Ijaradari scheme of Hastings), Santhal Rebellion (1855)
        -   **Phase between 1857 and 1920s**
            -   The INDIGO REVOLT (1859-60): Forced indigo plantation and price paid by the planters was meagre, only 2.5% of the market price
            -   PABNA AGRARIAN LEAGUES (1870s and 1880s): forcefully collected rents and land taxes even during famine caused by decline in jute production
            -   DECCAN RIOTS of 1875: Peasants revolted against increasing agrarian distress; rioters' specific purpose was to obtain and destroy the bonds, decrees in moneylenders
            -   **Weakness**: They did not target colonialism but they they targeted zamindars, money lenders who were just pawns in the colonial rule; Spontaneous and w/o planning; Lacked an effective leader; Did not possess a new ideology and struggles occurred within the framework of the old societal order
        -   **Phase (1920s-1946)**
            -   This phase was marked by the emergence of the class conscious peasant organisations. Ex: ALL INDIA KISAN SABHA formed in 1935, Agrarian program of congress in Faizpur,
            -   CDM blened peasants into the folds of national movt rather than regional movts.
            -   Ex: KISAN SABHA movement in UP due to efforts of home rule league, EKA MOVEMENT (eka means unity and it was marked by no violence, paying only recorded rent on time rather than hike rent), MAPPILA REVOLT (grievances were related to security of tenure, high rents against the Hindu landlords & brtish), BARDOLI SATYAGRAHA (revenue was hiked by 22% after struggle brought down to ~6%)
            -   Local issues integrated with the national cause of Swaraj. SWAMI SAHAJANAND led a heroic movement for the abolition of zamindari in Bihar, In UP, norevenue soon turned into no-rent
        -   **Post Independence**:
            -   TEBHAGA MOVEMENT in Bengal (1946): Sharecroppers wanted to reduce the share to be paid to jotedars to from 1/2 to 1/3 tebhaga) and also store the produce in their own godowns. The sharecroppers were encouraged by the FLOUD COMMISION which had already recommended their demand to the government
            -   TELANGANA MOVEMENT (1946-51) against practices of money lenders and officials of the Nizam of Hyderabad
    -   **Impact of above movements**:
        -   Awareness among the Indians in terms of their rights
        -   Eroded the power of EIC/zamindars
        -   Voices were factored into the national movts by various leaders
        -   Led to growth of nationalism as they felt closer to national identity rather than past
        -   Structured approach was developed in later stages
        -   Culmination to various revolts such as 1857 revolt, prepared ground for struggle with EIC before 1857 such as during Sikh wars, etc.
    -   **Conclusion**: Local rebellions or side movements are not well researched. Thus they need to be well documented

## THE REVOLT OF 1857

2016: Explain how the Uprising of 1857 constitutes an important watershed in the evolution of British policies towards colonial India [Evolution of British policies before and after Revolt (military, social, political)]

Debate on 1857 an indepennce movt.

-   **Major causes**
    -   **Political causes**: Policies like 'Effective control', 'Subsidiary alliance', and 'Doctrine of lapse' created suspicion in the minds of the people. Eg: RANI LAKSHMI BAI’S adopted son was not permitted to sit on the throne of Jhansi; Greedy policy of EIC, accompanied by broken pledges and oaths resulted in loss of prestige
    -   **Administrative causes**: Exclusion of Indians from administrative posts. Rampant corruption in the company's administration.
    -   **Economic causes**: Heavy taxation under new revenue settlement such as Mahalwari Settlement, summary evictions, discriminatory tariffs against Indian products, destruction of traditional handicrafts industry and absence of industrialisation.
    -   **Socio-Religious Causes**: Social legislations like Sati abolition act, 1829, Widow re-marraige act, 1856, etc were seen as interference. Missionary activities were seen with suspicion
    -   **Military Causes**: The General Service Enlistment Act decreed that future recruits to cross sea for providing their services which was not accepted by Hindus. No foreign service allowance (bhatta), Unhappy with emoluments compared to British counter parts. He was a 'peasant in uniform'
    -   **Influence of outside events** such as british suffered loss in 1st afghan war, crimean wars, etc.
    -   **Immediate Causes**: In 1856, the government decided to replace the old fashioned muskets by the Enfield rifles In order to load the Enfield rifle, the greased wrapping paper of the cartridge had to be bitten off by the soldier
-   **Brief details on Revolt**
    -   A young sepoy of the 34th Native Infantry, MANGAL PANDE fired at the sergeant major of his unit at Barrackpore. The 19th Native Infantry at Berhampur broke out in mutiny in Feb 1857.
    -   The revolt began at Meerut in May 1857, and then, gathering force rapidly. General mutiny began among the soldiers and they set off for Delhi. Delhi became the centre of the Great Revolt and BAHADUR SHAH, its symbol.
    -   It began as a revolt of the sepoys of the British East India Company’s army but eventually secured the participation of the masses
-   **Limitations**
    -   **Limited uprising**: although the revolt was fairly widespread, a large part of the country remained unaffected by it. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion. The southern provinces along with peasants did not take part in it.
    -   **No effective leadership**: the rebels lacked an effective leader. Although NANA SAHEB, TANTIA TOPE and RANI LAKSHMI BAI were brave leaders, they could not offer effective leadership to the movement as a whole.
    -   **Limited resources**: the rebels lacked resources in terms of men and money. The English, on the other hand, received a steady supply of men, money and arms in India.
    -   **No participation of the middle class**: The English educated middle class (they were satisfied by social reforms brought by EIC eg: sati abolition), the rich merchants, traders and zamindars of Bengal (happy as they got permanent settlement in bengal) helped the British to suppress the revolt
    -   HUL TRIBES were resented with EIC’s Sepoy army which crush their revolt during 1855. Rather than supporting sepoy they joined british in supressing the revolt
-   **Centres**:
    -   Delhi - General BAKHT KHAN
    -   Kanpur - NANA SAHEB
    -   Lucknow - BEGUM HAZRAT MAHAL
    -   Bihar - KUNWAR SINGH
    -   Jhansi - RANI LAXMIBHAI
-   **Significance**
    -   Revealed the fractures in the british army and administration
    -   Sowed the seeds of nationalism
    -   Women empowerment - RANI LAKSHMI BAI, HAZRAT MAHAL, ASHGARI BEGUM, etc. All of them not only participated in war but also facilitated communication networks
    -   Hindu Muslim Unity during the movt.
    -   Brought out in the open grievances of people and the sepoys, which were seen to be genuine
    -   Inspired future local movts. by civilians, farmers, tribals, etc
    -   Inspited leaders in future eg: RANI LAXMI BAI regiment in INA
    -   Led to direct rule by crown rather than EIC which led to abolition of doctrine of lapse,
-   **Nature of the movt**: (Analysis on first ind movt)
    -   V.D. SAVARKAR—“First War of independence”
    -   It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the so-called First National War of Independence of 1857 is neither First, nor National, nor War of Independence. - R.C. MAJUMDAR
    -   It was far more than a mutiny, ... yet much less than a first war of independence.
    -   **Conclusion**: Not quite the first war of independence but sowed the seeds of nationalism and quest for freedom from alien rule
-   **British response after it/Changes made**
    -   **Administartion**
        -   Government of India act, 1858 transferred the power from EIC to British crown.
        -   Indian councils act, 1861 returned the legislative powers to provinces of Madras and Bombay, etc.
        -   Bifurcating central and provincial finances by LORD MAYO in 1870, LORD RIPON resolution in 1882.
        -   Public services: Age was gradually brought down
    -   **Military Changes**:
        -   Artillery, fire arms (important wings) under control of Europeans
        -   Ration of European soldiers in army increased from 1:7 to 1:2 (1 european for 2 indian)
        -   Martial races such as Gorkha regiment, Sikh regiment were promoted as they did not participate in revolt
        -   Cut off from the rest of population by preventing the reach of newspapers and journals to it
    -   **Economic Policy**: From stage 1 to stage 2 and stage 3
    -   **Princely states**
        -   Policy of annexation was abandoned & Territorial integrity was guaranteed.
        -   Subordination of princely states to British authority as Queen adopted the title of KAISERI-I-HIND in 1876.
        -   Exercised the right to interfere in the internal matters of the states.
    -   **Policies**
        -   Divide and Rule to avoid united mass action (became anti-muslim after 1857 and at the same time focused on sub-dividing Hindu into caste via conducting census based on castes; After 1919 - British started favoring backward classes to further divide hindus)
        -   Zamindars and landlords were used as counter-weights
        -   Social services ignored as militarisation was promoted
        -   Non-interference in social and religious issues
        -   Restriction on freedom of press wherever it is helping nationalist upsurge
    -   **Foreign policy**: Keep other European powers at an Arms length
    -   **Conclusion**: Some were +ve but majorly others were -ve. The silver lining was that these miseries brought India together and fostered a sense of strong nationalism

## POST 1885 UPTO 1915

2017: Why did the ‘Moderates’ failed to carry conviction with the nation about their proclaimed ideology and political goals by the end of the nineteenth century? [Moderates/Extremists - Successes and failures]

2017: Examine how the decline of traditional artisanal industry in colonial India crippled the rural economy.(textile, agri, rural emp, industries

-   When the Britishers took over, traditional Indian artisans ruled the world, as famously quoted by PETER, THE GREAT that ‘commerce of India was the commerce of world!’
-   **Reasons**:
    -   Traditional artisanal industry lost its many patrons and contractual transactions, like rulers, zamindars
    -   Cheaper manufactured goods against which Indian handicrafts → earning less in spot transactions
    -   Increase in intermediaries to ensure sale of goods → also led to unscrupulous practices
    -   Tribal hunters and gatherers saw fall in demand of forest and minor produce
    -   One way trade policy
    -   Railways fastened the process of deindustrialization which crippled the economy further
    -   Pressure on agriculture increased which reduced productivity of the land → many became landless
    -   The prices became linked to international markets which them vulnerable → crash of cotton prices led to Deccan riots

2014: Examine critically the various facets of economic policies of the British in India from mid-eighteenth century till independence (Answer = 3 statges which are covered below)

-   **Organisation before INC** (these were not just political but socio-political org) - started in 1870s
    -   **Factors that led to their rise**: Economic critique, Unification of fate under british (via transport, markets, judiciary), Western education, Role of press/literature, Rediscovery of India’s past gave self confidence, Rise of middle class
    -   Indian political consciousness had already started with RAJA RAMMOHUN ROY. His associates established BANGABHASHA PRAKASIKA SABHA in 1836 to attract British attention towards grievances of the Indians
    -   EAST INDIA ASSOCIATION (1866): D NAOROJI, influence people in England and british press to discuss the Indian question
    -   POONA SARVAJANIK SABHA (1867): MG RANADE; Works done lecture tours to boost pride, worked in famines
    -   The INDIAN ASSOCIATION (1876): Founded by SURENDRANATH BANERJEA and ANANDA MOHAN BOSE - did main work to bring INC into formation
    -   MADRAS MAHAJAN SABHA 1884 - by M. VIRARAGHAVACHARI, B. SUBRAMANIYA AIYER and P. ANANDA CHARLU
    -   **Work done**: Campaigned for Indianisation of civil services, freedom of speech and expression by protesting against press acts, separation of judiciary from executive, repeal of Arms Act brought by LYTOON, Supported ILBERT BILL
-   **Why INC?**: Indians wanted to participate in pol. discourse & politcy **making** and not just be the policy **implementers** in the form of civil servants
-   **Moderates**
    -   Moderate leaders were those leaders who dominated INC during early phases (1885-1905) and believed in methods of Prayer, petition and protest (PPP). Leaders such as NAOROJI, DE WACHA, WC BANERJEE, PHEROZSHAH MEHTA. Overall they represented most progressive voices at that time.
    -   **Contributions**
        -   **Economic critique of British imperialism**
            -   Early nationalists like RC DUTT, DADABHAI NAOROJI, put forward the drain theory.
            -   Moderates were able to create an all-India public opinion that British rule in India was the major cause of India's poverty and economic backwardness.
        -   **Constitutional reforms and propaganda in legislature**
            -   Expansion and reform of council. Their demands for constitutional reforms were conceded in 1892 in the form of the Indian Council Acts, 1892.
            -   They gave their slogan 'No taxation without representation'.
            -   They used the councils for ventilating their grievances. Work was based on realities and not shallow sentiments
            -   Gradually, the scope of constitutional demands was widened and DADABHAI NAOROJI, GOKHALE demanded local selfgovernment like colonies of Canada and Australia.
        -   **General administrative reforms**
            -   Indianisation of government service (finally led to 1893 resolution to conduct simultaneous examination - but actually started in 1924)
            -   Separation of judicial from executive functions.
            -   Criticism of an aggressive foreign policy.
            -   Better treatment for Indian labour abroad.
        -   **Defence of civil right**
            -   They popularised the ideas of democracy, civil liberties and representative institutions by training people
            -   Public outrage at the arrest of TILAK
    -   **Failures**
        -   Moderates remained distant from masses hence their mass appeal remained ineffective. They believed hetreogenous elements of society need to be first veld together (the reason for inaction was conflicting interest of peasants & zamindars)
        -   Pray, petition and protest type of politics were not effective and extremists criticised them of being incompetent of getting reforms (described as political mendicancy)
        -   Bengal was divided against the will and wish of people, reduction in no. of memb in calcutta corporation, further amplification of repressive laws under IPC — all this showed their failed impact
        -   The political jargons used by the moderates were alien to uneducated masses
        -   People like SAVARKAR brothers and CHAPEKAR brothers started advocating extremism. Emergence of leaders like TILAK in congress led to new kind of environment that is more favourable to the extremists
        -   Overall INC, failed to attract much muslim leaders to their session. (led to muslim league and success of British rule to divide & rule)
-   **Extremists**
    -   **Reasons for rise of Extremists**
        -   Realisation that the true nature of British rule was exploitative, and that the British India government, instead of conceding more, was taking away even what existed eg: IPC, Press acts, disappointment with the Indian Councils Act of 1892
        -   Growth of self-confidence and self-respect among leaders such as TILAK urged them to bring masses into fold (work of SWAMIJI in glorification of india’s past)
        -   Impact of growth of education—increase in awareness and unemployment
        -   Primary and technical education was not making any advancement even Indian Universities Act,1904 brought universities under the tight administrative control of britishers
        -   International influences and events which demolished the myth of white/European supremacy eg: Boer Wars (1899-1902) in which the British faced reverses. — Japan’s victory over Russia (1905). — nationalist movements worldwide
        -   Dissatisfaction with the achievements/methods of the Moderates
        -   Reactionary policies of CURZON such as the Calcutta Corporation Act (1899), the Official Secrets Act (1904), the Indian Universities Act (1904) and partition of Bengal (1905)
        -   Existence of a militant school of thought led by LAL, BAL, PAL, AUROBINDO GHOSH
        -   Emergence of a trained leadership
    -   **Contributions**
        -   **General**:
            -   Articulation of the demand for ‘Swaraj’
            -   Reorient Indian religious traditions and link them with the national liberation struggle eg: AUROBINDO GHOSE said service of the millions of Indians was service of God; extremists conceived the nation as ‘Mother India’
            -   Emphasised the mobilisation of people and took upon as their responsiblity unlike moderates; extremists were ready to suffer imprisonment, deportation and other physical suffering for sake of mobilising masses
        -   **BAL**: Deccan Edu society, Indian Home Rule league, concluded Lucknow pact which led to Hindu-Muslin unity, weeklies such as Kesari/Mahratta, tried for sedition several times & spent 6 years in Mandalay prison, Ganeshotsav were used, conservative in views (against Hindu women getting modern education, opposed to the age of consent bill as wanted reform should come from within rather than outside)
        -   **LAL**: called ‘Punjab Kesari’, opposed to the partition of Bengal/untouchability, founded the Home Rule League of America in 1917 in New York to get international support, President of AITUC, against the Rowlatt Act and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, co-founded the Punjab National Bank, Led the silent protest against Simon Commission in which he was lathi charged → BHAGAT SINGH & team took revenge by killing SAUNDERS (actually wanted to kill JAMES SCOTT)
        -   **PAL**: popularising the idea of ‘swaraj’ to Indians, Swadeshi movt, newspaper Bande Mataram, participated in NCM, against the ‘Gandhi cult’, retired from active politics since 1920 but continued journalism till 1932, AUROBINDO GHOSH called Pal ‘one of the mightiest prophets of nationalism’.
        -   **What Gandhiji learnt from Extremists**: Ideas of satyagraha from AUROBINDO GHOSE in his essay on ‘Passive Resistance’; Further built on the interpretation of Gita by TILAK; Gandhi described himself as a ‘true disciple’ of LOKMANYA TILAK, Continued the ideals of Swadeshi/national education/boycott; Like TILAK, Gandhi deemed it necessary to sacrifice and endure suffering in the cause of the country
    -   **Failures**
        -   Sometimes their activities tend to be more religious in nature like Ganesh Utsav which actually alienated some sections
        -   They could not attract large scale participation
        -   They could not give sustained leadership and organised action as l’ship fisseled out abruptly
        -   Both moderates & extremists reconcile and work together which weakened the movt. Both sides also could not decipher the repression-conciliation-suppression approach of britishers (repress mildly to scare moderates, then promise concession to moderates and isolate extremists, suppress the extremists in the end)
-   **Economic critique of colonialism**
    -   The economic critique gave a zolt to moral ground taken by Britishers that ‘British rule in India is for Indians’
    -   They highlighted British exploitation of India through drain of wealth (DoW) theory. This led to transformation of a basically self-sufficient Indian economy into a colonial economy. They said british rule is the main cause of India’s poverty and economic backwardness
    -   Major components of drain theory were - salaries, pensions, interests on loan taken by indian govt, profits on foreign investments, payment for banking/shipping/insurance,
    -   Role played by DADABHAI NAOROJI (Book: ENGLAND'S DEBT TO INDIA; POVERTY & UNBRITISH RULE), R.C. DUTT (Book: THE ECONOMIC HISTORY OF INDIA), MG RANADE, GK GOKHALE, etc.
    -   **Economic Impact**:
        -   Deindustrialisation led to ruin of artisans and handicraftsmen due to one way trade allowed under Charter Act 1813 (cheap british imports and heavy duties for indian textiles); The loss was not accompanied by a process of industrialisation in India
            -   Indian literature is also a testimony of deindustrialisation eg: Urdu couplets on DOWSON SHOE MAKERS
        -   Impoverishment of peasantry led to ruralisation of India. Peasants faced the triple burden of govt, zamindar and money lender
        -   Emergence of new intermediaries, absentee landlordism & ruin of old zamindars. By 1815, half the land of the Bengal had passed into new hands
        -   Stagnation and deterioration of agriculture due to low productivity. Sub-infeudation led to fragmentation and made it diff to adopt modern tech. Forced commercialisation of Indian agriculture turned agriculture into a business rather than way of life
        -   Modern industries which were developed were foreign owned, while indian industries faced discrimination in tariffs, loan credit, etc. Heavy indus ignored and regional disparities
        -   Rise of Indian national bourgeoisie (traders, moneylenders and bankers) who acted as junior partners of English merchant capitalists
        -   Economic Drain = Interest on Foreign Capital Investments + Home Charges
        -   Famine and poverty (eg: during WW2, grain ships were unnecessarily driven away from bengal which led to huge famine)
    -   **Tools used**:
        -   Advocated for extension of permanent settlement from bengal to other areas (as land revenue stayed fixed under this system)
        -   INC organised industrial exhibitions to develop industries
-   **Stages of Economic Policy**
    -   **Stage 1: Policy of Mercantilism or Period of Monopoly (1757 to 1813)**
        -   2 main aims were to create monopoly over trade with india against other domestic/foreign competitiors and take over governmental revenues through control over state power
        -   No major social changes were made in edu/culture/social organisation (as currently industrialisation was not at peak thus there was no need for modern customers as of now)
        -   Large scale DoW which amounted to 2-3% of britain’s income at that time
        -   There were no large scale imports of british goods, rather it was reverse, Indian export of textiles got increased (however due to monopoly price fetched was poor)
    -   **Stage 2: Lassiez Faire stage or Policy of free trade (1813 to 1860s)**
        -   Industrial revolution was now at good heights in England thus there was a debate that EIC should not serve interest of capitalists in england rather than interest of EIC (capitalists wanted raw material for machines and not textiles and saw indians as customers)
        -   Free trade was introduced which was one-way ie. nearly 0% duty on british exports to india while heavy duties on indian exports (even some indian goods were banned in britain);
        -   Deindustrialisation happened for industries such as textiles; Traditional handicrafts were thrown out of gear—a period when the ‘homeland of cotton was inundated with cotton’ (KARL MARX)
        -   Agriculture was commercialised to serve british interest; Plantations came up; Market also became linked to international prices which causes wide fluctuations (eg: after american civil war when cotton supply increased, prices crashed in India → ultimately leading to Deccan riots)
        -   Steps were taken to modernize indians through education, christian missionaries got free go after charter act 1813, monopoly of company was removed after 1813
        -   India absorbed as 10-12% of total british exports
    -   **Stage 3: Stage of Financial Capitalism (1860-1947)**
        -   Industrial Rev & DoW led to accumualtion of capital; Investing it britain would not fetch high interest so they invested it in India
        -   Investment were made in areas which would serve british interest such as Railways (which was built only from port to hinterlands to ensure better access of raw material and customers); The materials to build railway tracks was also imported from england rather than using indian capacity
        -   Witnessed reactionary policies of LYTTON, CURZON, etc. which wanted to justify white man’s burden or that Indians need trusteeship of britishers
-   **Swadeshi Movement**
    -   **Causes**
        -   Major cause can be attributed to partition of Bengal in 1905 (which became known in 1903) which was seen by the Indian nationalist as a divisionary tactics of Britishers to weaken the Bengali (Bhadralok) intelligentsia
            -   Effect was the West portion of bengal became bengali minority + hindu majority where as east portion became muslim majority; Development of infra for plantation/ports was started in East B to woo muslims
        -   Other causes: Growing awareness of british exploitation, Climax of CURZON’S exploitative policies, Punjab land alienation Act of 1900 which prohibited any sale or purchase of land for 15 years by non-peasants, Other acts such as Calcutta Corporation Act, Indian university commission Act 1904
        -   Bengal partitions (mention reasons whether admin reasons or political)
    -   **Major features and strategies used**
        -   **Phase of Moderate 1903-05**: Led by SURENDRANATH BANERJEA, K.K. MITRA, PRITHWISHCHANDRA RAY
            -   Methods used were 3Ps through through newspapers and pamphlets
        -   **Phase of Extremists 1905-08**: Led by LAL, BAL, PAL, AUROBINDO GHOSH
            -   Methods were: included boycott of foreign cloth and other goods (such as salt,sugar), public meetings and processions, forming corps of volunteers or samitis (such as SWADESH BANDHAB SAMITI by ASHWINI KUMAR DUTTA to generate conciousness), use of popular festivals and melas for propaganda (ganesh, shivaji festivals), emphasis on self-reliance or atma shakti (campaigned against dowry, alcohol), launching programme of swadeshi or national education (Bengal National College, National Council of Education), swadeshi or indigenous enterprises (Swadeshi Steam Navigation Co), initiating new trends in Indian painting (by ABANINDRANATH TAGORE), songs (AMAR SONAR BANGLA), poetry, pioneering research in science (work by JC BOSE study of biology, PC RAY) and later calling for boycott of schools, colleges, councils, government service, etc
    -   **Contributions of sections**: (nature of mass participation in the movt.)
        -   Extent of mass participation: Students (picketing), women (picketing), certain sections of zamindari, labour (formed Railwaymen’s Union) some lower middle and middle classes in towns and cities participated for the first time while the Muslims generally kept away
    -   **Impact**
        -   **+ve**:
            -   Movement added untouched women section and students into protests; Aroused people from slumber and gave them experience for future
            -   Hindu-Muslims tied threads to each other hands to show unity between both the religions
            -   Resulted in significant decline in the foreign imports during 1905-1908 → thus undermining the hegemony of colonialism
            -   1906 Congress Session passed a resolution for Swaraj
            -   Concept of constructive swadeshi and boycott was actively used by Gandhi in later nationalist movements
            -   Impacts on eduation, culture (points also covered above)
                -   Charkha (spinning wheel) came to typify the popular concern for country’s economic self-sufficiency
                -   Passive Resistance/Satyagraha was first time used in this movement which became vital tool for future agitation
                -   Revival and emergence of nationalist art and education. It was during this movement that the concept of BHARAT MATHA was promoted
            -   Movement resulted in growth of extreme nationalism amongst youth which took to violence and wanted to bring an instant end to British dominance
        -   **-ve**:
            -   The movement however also set the undertones for communal disharmony by invoking religious sentiments, setting foundation for Muslim League, separate electorate in act of 1909
            -   There was minimal involvement of peasants and tribals
        -   **Reasons why Swadeshi Movement fizzled out by 1908**:
            -   Severe government repression
            -   Lack of effective organisation in party and a disciplined focus (eg: various methods were being used w/o proper focus)
            -   With arrest/deportation of all leaders, the movement left leaderless (as leader were either arrested or deported)
            -   Split in nationalist ranks due to Sural Split
            -   Narrow social base - failed to reach peasantry
    -   **Moderates vs Extremist**
        -   **Reason for split**: Moderates wanted to restrict the Boycott Movement to Bengal and to a boycott of foreign cloth and liquor. Extremists wanted to take the movement to all parts of the country and include within its ambit all forms of association with the government through a boycott of schools, colleges, law courts, legislative councils, government service, municipalities, etc
-   **Revolutionary Heroism**
    -   **Causes for their rise**: Younger elements not ready to retreat after the decline of open phase movt (therefore phase 1 was fallout of Swadeshi whereas Phase 2 was fallout of NCM); Leadership’s failure to tap revolutionary energies of the youth; Government repression left no peaceful avenues open for protest; Inspired from the individual heroic action on the lines of Irish nationalists or Russian nihilists; The questioned the non-violent approach of INC and believed in violent struggle
    -   **Impact**
        -   **+ve**:
            -   Target was to achieve three things: (a) to strike fear in the officials by assassination of unpopular officials (b) to remove the fear of the Indian people and (c) ignite a feeling of national consciousness
            -   They raised the banner of Indian cause on foreign soils like LALA HAR DAYAL’S GHADAR
            -   Revolutionary movement also contributed towards socialistic ideas. Ex: BHAGAT SINGH
            -   Both Punjab and Bengal revolutionaries were secular in their organisation and working
            -   Bengal revolutionaries took active help of women, thus bringing them into freedom struggle fold
            -   Annulment of Bengal partion was done mainly to pacifiy revolutionaries
        -   **-ves/why the failed/limitations**
            -   They could not reach to the peasant and workers as it was an urban phenomena. They failed to build either a nation-wide organisation or a mass base
            -   Lack of leadership qualities and communication left many times with failed attempts
            -   British Government came up with various acts to repress growing militarism
            -   Adherence to religion had kept muslims away
            -   use of violence as a political weapon gave a justification to the British to counter them by using more violence
    -   **Phase 1 of extremism: Post 1908 till WW1**
        -   Individual heroic actions rather than mass-based countrywide struggle
        -   **Examples**:
            -   **Maharashtra**:
                -   TILAK propogated militancy among the youth through festivals and journals
                -   CHAPEKAR brothers kill RAND, the plague commissioner
                -   MITRA MELA—a secret society organised by SAVARKAR later merged into ABHINAV BHARAT
                -   District Magistrate of Nasik—JACKSON—killed by Abhinav Bharat members
            -   **Bengal**:
                -   ANUSHILAN SAMITI founded by PROMOTHAMITTER, BARINDRA KUMAR GHOSH (gave physical and moral training to youth)
                -   YUGANTAR was started to advocate revolutionary violence
                -   PRAFULLA CHAKI and KHUDIRAM BOSE attempt to murder Muzaffarpur Magistrate (but killed 2 ladies)
                -   Bomb thrown at Viceroy HARDINGE by RASHBEHARI BOSE and SACHIN SANYAL
                -   BAGHA JATIN and RASHBEHARI BOSE involved in German Plot during WW1
            -   **Punjab**:
                -   Revolutionary activity by LALA LAJPAT RAI, AJIT SINGH, AGA HAIDAR SYED HAIDAR RAZA, BHAI PARMANAND, FALAK (urdu poet)
                -   Agitated against freq famines, high land revenue, irrigation tax
            -   **International**:
                -   SHYAMJI KRISHNAVARMA set up INDIA HOUSE and brought out journal THE SOCIOLOGIST in London
                -   MADAME BHIKAJI CAMA operated from Paris and Geneva (waived flag on foreign soil)
                -   In North America, the GHADR was organised by LALA HARDAYAL, RAMCHANDRA, BHAWAN SINGH, KARTAR SINGH SARABA, BARKATULLAH, BHAI PARMANAND
                -   Aim of Ghadr was assasinate officials, publish revolutionary literature, bring about a simultaneous revolt in all colonies of Britain
                -   Planned to use favourable conditions of WW1 and KOMAGATA MARU incident, however due to treachery plan failed; Defence of India Act, 1915 passed primarily to deal with the Ghadrites
    -   **Phase 2 of extremism: Post 1922 till early 1930s**
        -   In the 2nd phase, the revolutionaries gradually moved away from individual heroic action and were attracted by the possibility of armed mass struggle. A number of them also came under the influence of Socialism; Phase 2 influenced by Russian revolution, marxist ideas, upsurge of worker trade unionism
        -   **Examples**:
            -   HRA was formed in 1924 by BISMIL, JC CHATTERJEE and SACHIN SANYAL with an aim to organise an armed revolt to overthrow the colonial government.
            -   Kakori robbery in 1925. Government cash was looted
            -   HRA to HSRA in 1928. Inspired by socialist events
            -   SAUNDERS murder by BHAGAT SINGH, AZAD and RAJGURU
            -   Bomb in central legislative assembly against the passage of the public safety bill and Trade disputes bill aimed at curtailing civil liberties of citizens (aim was to ‘make the deaf hear’)
            -   CHITTAGONG ARMOURY RAID to seize and supply arms to the revolutionaries to destroy telephone and telegraph lines. Involved SURYA SEN, PRITILATA WADDEDAR, KALPANA DUTTA
            -   BINA DAS and SANTI GHOSH shot governor and Distt. Magistrate respectively
    -   **Conclusion**: The selfless sacrifice of the revolutionaries like BHAGAT SINGH, CHANDRASEKHAR AZAD , SURYA SEN and hundreds of others gained for them unparalleled popularity among the people
-   2013: The reforms of 1909 introduced a cardinal problem and ground of controversy at every revision of the Indian electoral system. Comment.
    -   The wave of nationalism during 1910s was detrimental to the stability of British empire. Creating a wedge between the nationalists was therefore seen necessary to counter this wave
    -   **Cardinal Problem**: MORLEY MINTO reforms introduced the idea of separate electorates that turned out to be a cardinal problem and a ground of controversy all through the history of our freedom struggle.
        -   Policy of separate electorates appeased the Muslims and bought their loyalty – something that was desperately needed by the British.
        -   As a result the Muslims and their organisations (Muslim League) became an instruments in the hands of the British to check Congress and its activities. The question of separate electorates became a ground of controversy at several instances leading to a deadlock.
        -   Such deadlocks became an excuse for the British government to avoid the substantial reforms needed for establishing a responsible government in India
    -   **Impact**
        -   Idea of separate electorates introduced communalism in the Indian politics that took a centre stage at every revision for a Constitutional reform.
        -   Intertwining the religion with politics proved to be detrimental for the freedom struggle of India as it led to the failure of several future negotiations between the British and the Nationalists.
        -   Impressed by the outcomes of separate electorates the British government decided to intensify it by extending it to Sikhs, Christians, Anglo Indians and Europeans (GOI 1919)
        -   Controversies like non acceptance of Nehru Report, failure of second round table conference (question of separate electorates for minorities), non endorsement of Rajagopalachari Formula etc sucked away the strength of our freedom struggle
    -   **Conclusion**: Reforms of 1909 were a landmark event that introduced a cardinal problem of communalism in politics. It created a wedge in the Indian society on communal lines as a result of which not only was our Independence delayed but also freedom was accompanied by a severe bloodshed (partition).

## GANDHIAN PHASE

-   Home rule leagues by ANNIE BESANT and TILAK- focus on educating the masses wrt need to explain common man need for self- rule, opening libraries, discussion, public meetings, estb link btw town and masses
-   Coming of Gandhi (aspects of South Africa, ideology of Satyagraha,
-   **South Africa phase**
    -   Understood need for change when thrown out of train
    -   Moderate phase of G :relied on sending petitions to authorities in South Africa. He setup NATAL INDIAN CONGRESS and started a paper INDIAN OPINION.

    -   Setting up TOLSTOY FARM: Meant to house the families of the Satyagrahis and to give them a way to sustain themselves.
    -   Campaign against TRANSVAAL ACT, POLL TAX and invalidation of Indian Marriages
-   **Champaran Satyagraha**
    -   The first civil disobedience movement( gandhi refused to leave) by Gandhi in the freedom struggle. Also first experiment of Satyagraha in India
    -   After peaceful protests against the planters and landlords led by Gandhi, the government agreed to abolish the exploitative tinkathia system.
    -   It was during this time that Gandhi was given the names ‘Bapu’ and ‘Mahatma’ by the people.
-   **Kheda Satyagraha**
    -   Failed crops due to droughts, As per law, the farmers were entitled to remission if the produce was less than a quarter of the normal output, but the government refused
    -   SARDAR VALLABHBHAI PATEL, under Gandhi’s guidance, led the farmers in protest against the collection of taxes in the wake of the famine.
    -   Finally, the authorities gave some concessions to the farmers.
-   **Ahmedabad Mill Strike**
    -   Gandhi used hunger strike for the first time during an industrial dispute between the owners and workers of a cotton mill in Ahmedabad- strike was successful and the workers were granted the wage hike
-   **Rowlatt Satyagraha**
    -   ROWLATT SATYAGRAHA - response to the British government enacting the ANARCHICAL AND REVOLUTIONARY CRIMES ACT of 1919 or ROWLATT ACT. Gandhiji called for a countrywide satyagraha.
    -   But before it could be launched, there were large-scale violent, anti-British demonstrations in Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Punjab(Jalliawala Bagh happened)
    -   Mahatma Gandhi gave up the title of KAISER-I-HIND, bestowed by the British for his work during the Boer Wa also was overwhelmed by the atmosphere of total violence and withdrew the movement on April 18, 1919.

#### NON-COOPERATION KHILAFAT MOVEMENT

-   The non-cooperation movement launched in 1920 at Congress session in Calcutta under leadership of Gandhi who travelled across the nation explaining the tenets of the movement- Adopt swadeshi principles and habits including hand spinning & weaving, Work for the eradication of untouchability from society.
-   Decisive step in freedom struggle because for the first time, the INC was ready to forego constitutional means to achieve self-rule.
-   **Features of NCM**
    -   Indians were asked to relinquish their titles and resign from nominated seats in the local bodies as a mark of protest, resign from their government jobs, withdraw their children from government-controlled or aided schools and colleges, boycott foreign goods
    -   Also planned that if the above steps did not bring results, people would refuse to pay their taxes.
    -   Demanded Swaraj or self-government, redresel of punjab wrongs and fav treaty for turkey
    -   Only completely non-violent means would be employed to get the demands fulfilled.
    -   Gandhiji had assured that Swaraj would be achieved in a year if this movement was continued to completion.
-   **Causes**
    -   Resentment at the British after the war: Indians thought in return for the extensive support of manpower and resources during WW1 they would be rewarded by autonomy but GOI 1919 was dissatisfactory, British also passed repressive acts - Rowlatt Act which further angered many Indians
    -   Home Rule Movement: set the stage anyway for NCM, also extremists-moderates united with extremist taking upper hand as well as Lucknow Pact(INC- ML came together) common demands for NCM.
    -   Economic hardships due to World War I:Prices of goods began to soar which affected the common man- resentment against the government.
    -   The repressive Rowlatt Act and the brutal massacre at Jallianwala Bagh: faith in the British system of justice broken- masses angry and wanted to give out energies.
    -   The Khilafat Movement: After Turkey’s defeat, the Ottoman caliphate proposed to be dissolved. Muslims regarded Sultan of Turkey as their Caliph .The Khilafat movement launched under ALI BROTHERS , MAULANA AZAD, HASRAT MOHANI along with support from Gandhi to persuade the British government not to abolish the caliphate and these leaders joined NCM.
-   **Significance of Non-Cooperation Movement**
    -   Truly mass movement where lakhs of Indians participated, shook the British government who were stumped by the extent of the movement.
    -   It saw participation from both Hindus and Muslims- showcasing communal harmony in the country.
    -   As a result of this movement, people became conscious of their political rights. They were not afraid of the government- Hordes of people thronged to jails willingly.
    -   The Indian merchants and mill owners enjoyed good profits during this period as a result of the boycott of British goods. Khadi was promoted, The import of sugar from Britain reduced considerably during this period.
    -   This movement also established Gandhiji as a leader of the masses as well as established the popularity of the Congress Party among the people.
-   **Why suspended?**
    -   Gandhiji called off the movement in 1922 in the wake of the CHAURI CHAURA incident saying people not ready for revolt against the government through ahimsa.
    -   SC BOSE- to order retreat just when public enthusiasm was reaching boiling point- nothing short of national calamity.
-   **Analysis of Khilafat**
    -   Gandhi saw in the Khilafat movement a golden opportunity to unite Indian Hindus and Muslims and present a joint front to the colonial government.
    -   The Khilafat movement was criticised for mixing religion with politics- led to the radicalisation of the movement and the sidelining of moderate leaders of the movement who supported Gandhi’s creed of non-violence.
    -   The religious fervour generated by the Khilafat movement saw the outbreak of Moplah riots in Malabar, rise in militant Hindu radicalism in response to the movement.
    -   The Khilafat movement set a precedent for future mobilisation of the Muslim masses by invoking religious symbols which replicated during Pakistan movement.

#### CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT

-   most popular and organized mass movement of the freedom struggle.
-   Calcutta session 1928- one year ultimatum to accept dominion status or CDM to be launched for complete independence.
-   Lahore session 1929- complete ind(purna swaraj as goal), decided to launch CDM with G leadership inc non payment of taxes as well legislative members to resign, Jan 26 to be celebrated as first indep day, Round Table Conference to be boycotted
-   Gandhi presented eleven demands to the Government and gave an ultimatum to accept or reject these demands.(one of them- Abolish salt tax and government's salt monopoly)
-   Salt formula for CDM- ,G- "There is no other article like salt, outside water, by taxing which the Government can reach the starving millions, the sick, the maimed and the utterly helpless. It is the most inhuman poll tax the ingenuity of man can devise.",
-   Salt linked the ideal of swaraj with universal grievance of the rural poor (and with no socially divisive implications like a no-rent campaign). Like khadi, again, it offered to the urban people the opportunity of a symbolic identification with mass suffering.
-   **Spread of CDM**
    -   Defiance of salt laws across country. In Tamil Nadu, RAJAGOPALACHARI led VEDARANYAM MARCH. KELAPPAN led a march in Malabar, SAROJINI NAIDU lead a raid on DHARSANA SALT WORKS.
    -   KHAN ABDUL GAFFAR KHAN'S 'KHUDAI KHIDMATGARS' movement.
    -   In Sholapur, textile workers went on a strike and burnt liquor shops and other symbols of Government authority such as railway stations, etc.
    -   A campaign was organised in Bihar and Bengal against Chowkidara tax.
    -   In Gujarat, a determined no-tax movement was organised.
    -   In Maharastra, Karnataka, central provinces there was defiance against forest laws.
    -   In Assam, a powerful agitation was organised against infamous CUNNINGHAM CIRCULAR which forced students to furnish assurances of good behaviour.
    -   RANI GAIDINLU of Nagaland raised a banner of revolt against foreign rule.
-   **Mass participation**
    -   Women picketing.
    -   Students played most prominent part in boycott of foreign cloth and liquor.
    -   Tribals in central provinces, Maharashtra and Karnataka.
    -   Workers participated in Sholapur.
    -   Peasants were active in UP, Bihar and Gujarat.
    -   Elections to legislative assembly were boycotted.
-   **Gandhi-Irwin Pact**
    1.  Led to withdrawal of CDM, INC to attend 2nd RTC, Irwin agreed to release political prisoners not convicted of violence, return of lands not sold to third parties, right to make salt in coastal villages for personal consumption, right to peaceful picketing, withdrawl of emergecy ordinance.
    2.  **Why INC agreed**
        1.  Mass movements are necessarily short-lived as people’s capacity to sacrifice is not endless.
        2.  Government could have crushed the movement any time ferociously.
        3.  National confidence increased as the mighty British Government and national leaders came on an equal footing to sign a pact.
    3.  **Controversy**
        1.  Gandhiji refused to make the Pact conditional on the commutation of the death sentences of BHAGAT SINGH and his comrades.
        2.  The Pact is also criticised due to the vacillating nature of the Indian bourgeoisie and Gandhiji succumbing to bourgeois pressure. It is alleged that Gandhiji was apprehensive of the mass movement taking a radical turn.
        3.  The pact did not immediately restore confiscated land. Therefore, peasants were not happy with the pact signed.
-   **Second phase of CDM**
    -   At 2nd RTC- British said congress not sole rep- handpicked communalist, landlords, princely states, Gandhi returned empty handed
    -   British policy hardened- prevent revival of movement, armed itself with draconian ordinance and martial law, thosuands arrested and put in jails, No tax and no rent campaigns to were treated with harshness.
    -   Though the people fought back the leaders couldn’t build a tempo and the CDM phase 2 was crushed and lingered till 1934 and then was withdrawn by Gandhiji.
    -   Many leader like SC BOSE and VITHALBHAI PATEL criticized Gandhiji’s decision. But decision was due to the fact that people needed to rest and regroup for the next fight. They had not lost their faith in congress yet.
-   **Significance/Limitations and comparison with NCM**
    -   The stated objective this time was complete independence and not just remedying two specific wrongs and a vaguely-worded swaraj.
    -   The methods involved violation of law from the very beginning and not just non-cooperation with foreign rule
    -   There was a decline in forms of protests involving the intelligentsia, such as lawyers giving up practice, students giving up government schools to join national schools and colleges.
    -   Massive participation of peasants and business groups compensated for decline of other features.
    -   The number of those imprisoned was about three times more this time.
    -   The Congress was organisationally stronger.
    -   **However**
        -   Muslim participation was nowhere near the NonCooperation Movement level due government’s efforts to push communalism as response to nationalism.(through RTC, Simon commision, GOI acts)
        -   Industrial workers didn’t participate in large number except in Nagpur.
        -   No major labour upsurge coincided with the movement.

## POST WW-II

PYQ:

2019: Assess the role of British imperial power in complicating the process of transfer of power during 1940s

-   With WW2 in 1939- various colonial rule ended- British too incapable to manage vast country such as India with limited resources as well as INC agitations over the years. With QIM,INA, RIN- transfer of power evident but various complications such as:
    -   AUGUST OFFER(1940)- offered Dominion statusbut widened the gulf as now demands of complete independence- rejected by nationalists
    -   CRIPPS MISSION(1942)- To gain India support for war- however provisions of right to seccede for provinces against national unity- also British take it or leave it attitude- Nationalist rejected
    -   WAVELL PLAN(1945)- plan for resolving deadlock btw INC and ML. Attempted to reduce INC as caste hindu party with virtual veto of ML- again rejected
    -   CABINET MISSION(1946)- rejected two nations and provided for grouping of assemblies, Both accepted but issues in provisions- led to ML demand for Pakistan with Direct Action day
    -   ATTLEE STATEMENT(1947)- abrupt deadline on 30 june 1948 for transfer of power, contained clear hints of Balkanisation and partition
    -   MOUNTBATTEN PLAN(1947)- freedom with 2 dominion status, but partition led to horrors with abrupt boundary commision- deaths etc
    -   **Conclusion**: Lack of clarity in the transfer problem has led to recurrent problems across border which are straining India-Pakistan ties

2014: In what ways did the naval mutiny prove to be the last nail in the coffin of British colonial aspirations in India?

-   Covered below
-   **Individual Satyagraha**
    -   After B refused to budge on Indian demnads of transfer of power, Gandhiji decided to launch satyagraha on an individual basis.
    -   **Objectives**
        -   To express people’s feeling that they are not interested in the war
        -   and that they made no distinction between Nazism and double autocracy that ruled in India. It also propagated the freedom of speech.
        -   To give another opportunity to the Government to accept congress demands peacefully as Gandhiji was still reluctant to divert British’s attention against the Nazi onslaught.

#### QUIT INDIA MOVEMENT

-   Mumbai’s Gowalia Tank Maidan - Quit India movement (August Kranti)1942 launched by Mahatma Gandhi
-   The movement gave the slogans ‘Quit India’ or ‘Bharat Chodo’. Gandhi gave the slogan to the people – ‘Do or die’- Most ungandhian movement of G,
-   **Quit India resolution**:
    -   An immediate end to British rule over India.
    -   Declaration of the commitment of free India to defend itself against all kinds of imperialism and fascism.
    -   Formation of a provisional government of India after British withdrawal.
    -   Sanctioning a full civil disobedience against British rule.
    -   **Gandhi’s instructions to various sections of the public**:
        -   Government servants: do not resign your job but proclaim loyalty to the INC.
        -   Soldiers: be with the army but refrain from firing on compatriots.
        -   Peasants: pay the agreed-upon rent if the landlords/Zamindars are anti-government; if they are pro-government, do not pay the rent.
        -   Students: can leave studies if they are confident enough.
        -   Princes: support the people and accept the sovereignty of them.
        -   People of the princely states: support the ruler only if he is anti-government; declare themselves as part of the Indian nation.
-   **Causes of QIM**
    -   The Second World War started in 1939 and Japan gaining onto the north-eastern frontiers of India. The British had abandoned their territories in South-East Asia and had left their population in the lurch. This act did not garner much faith among the Indian population who had doubts about the British ability to defend India against Axis aggression.
    -   Gandhi also believed that if the British left India, Japan would not have enough reason to invade India.
    -   Apart from hearing news about British setbacks in the war, the war-time difficulties such as high prices of essential commodities fostered resentment against the British government.
    -   The failure of the Cripps Mission to guarantee any kind of a constitutional remedy to India’s problems also led to the INC calling for a mass civil disobedience movement.
-   **Response to QIM**
    -   Arresting all major Congress leaders the very next day. Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, etc. were all arrested. INC declared unlawful. Movement in the hands of the younger leaders like JAYAPRAKASH NARAYAN and RAM MANOHAR LOHIA, ARUNA ASAF ALI, USHA MEHTA.
    -   They were mass floggings and lathi charges. Even women and children were not spared. About 10000 people died in police firing in total. However there was no communal violence.
    -   In the absence of leadership, there were incidences of violence and damage to government property. Many buildings were set on fire, electricity lines were cut and communication and transport lines were broken.
    -   In some places, parallel governments were also set up. Example: Ballia, Tamluk, Satara. The chief areas of the movement were UP Bihar, Maharashtra, Midnapore, and Karnataka. The movement lasted till 1944.
    -   Some parties did not support the movement. There was opposition from the Muslim League, the Communist Party of India and the Hindu Mahasabha.
        -   The League was not in favour of the British leaving India without partitioning the country first. In fact, JINNAH asked more Muslims to enlist in the army to fight the war.
        -   The Communist party supported the war waged by the British since they were allied with the Soviet Union. Despite the communist group’s lack of support to the movement, workers provided support by not working in the factories.
    -   SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSE, was by this time, organizing the Indian National Army and the Azad Hind government from outside the country.
-   **Significance**
    -   Despite heavy-handed suppression by the government, the people were unfazed and continued their struggle. Public morale and anti-British sentiment were enhanced.
    -   Even though the government said that independence could be granted only after the end of the war, the movement drove home the point that India could not be governed without the support of the Indians.
    -   The movement placed the demand for complete independence at the top agenda of the freedom movement.

#### INDIAN NATIONAL ARMY:

-   BOSE reached Japanese-controlled Singapore in 1943, issued his famous call ‘Delhi Chalo’, and formed the AZAD HIND GOVERNMENT and the INDIAN NATIONAL ARMY
-   INA first formed under MOHAN SINGH which comprised Indian prisoners of war captured by Japan in Malaysia. Civilians joined INA too later.
-   The I.N.A. was non-communal, with Muslims quite prominent among its ranks, also introduced the innovation of a women’s detachment named after the RANI OF JHANSI.
-   The INA fought allied forces in 1944 inside the borders of India in Imphal (flag hoisted here) and in Burma.
-   However, with the fall of Rangoon and retreat of Japan along with Bose death, Azad Hind Government ceased to be an effective political entity.
-   **Impact**: The I.N.A trials created the wave of disaffection during the 1945-46
-   **INA agitation was landmark**
    -   INA agitation internationalised the issue of Indian independence- intensity of the campaign for the release of INA prisoners was unprecedented - evident from the press coverage and other publicity it got.
    -   Had wide geographical reach upto Sindh, Balochistan,Indians abroad and Gurdwara committees subscribed liberally to INA funds.
    -   Participation of diverse social groups and political parties. INC, Muslim League, Sikh bodies, all supported leniency for INA.
    -   Even spread to groups such as government employees, loyalist sections and even men of the armed forces.
    -   No communal clashes occurred (British had inadvertently put one Hindu, Muslim, Sikh on trial first).
    -   Students, youth, workers, etc., started to pledge revenge on British if any INA man was sentenced. The matter went out if control for British when Calcutta hartals and Royal Indian Navy strike occurred.

#### RIN MUTINY

-   75 years ago in 1946,- 1,100 Indian sailors or “ratings” of the HMIS TALWAR and the ROYAL INDIAN NAVY (RIN) in Bombay declared a hunger strike, triggered by the conditions and treatment of Indians in the Navy.
-   Immediate trigger- arrest of a rating, BC DUTT, whoscrawled “Quit India” on the HMIS TALWAR.
-   **Demads**
    -   release of all political prisoners including those from INA, revision of pay and allowances to put RIN employees on a par with their counterparts in the Royal Navy, release of Indian forces stationed in Indonesia, and better treatment of subordinates by their officers, demand for better food and working conditions
-   All these later turned into a wider demand for independence from British as it came at a time when the Indian nationalist sentiment had reached fever pitch across the country.
-   **Upsurge of nationalism**
    -   Between 10,000-20,000 sailors joined in Karachi, Madras, Calcutta, Mandapam, Visakhapatnam, and the Andaman Islands.
    -   the ratings went around Bombay in lorries, waving the Congress flag, and getting into scraps with Europeans and policemen who tried to confront them.
    -   The winter of 1945-46 saw three violent upsurges: in Calcutta in November 1945 over the INA trials; in February 1946, also in Calcutta, over the sentencing of INA officer RASHID ALI; and, in that same month, the ratings’ uprise in Bombay.
    -   Soon, ordinary people joined the ratings, and life came to a virtual standstill in both Bombay and Calcutta. There were meetings, processions, strikes, and hartals.
    -   In Bombay, labourers participated in a general strike called by the Communist Party of India and the Bombay Students’ Union. In many cities across India, students boycotted classes in solidarity.
    -   The response of the state was brutal. It is estimated that over 220 people died in police firing, while roughly 1,000 were injured.
-   **Significance of the events**
    -   The RIN revolt remains a legend today as it strengthened the determination among all sections to see the end of British rule.
    -   Deep solidarity and amity among religious groups was in evidence, counter to the rapidly spreading atmosphere of commuanal hatred.
    -   However, communal unity was more in the nature of organisational unity , Muslim ratings advice from ML, Hindu and others from INC.
-   **Final nail in the coffin**
    -   After 1857 it was the first time that the British realized that the Royal Indian forces were no more obedient to the British commands, rather it was the nationalist leaders who held sway over them. The RIN revolt was seen as an event marking the end of British rule.
    -   Mutinies are usually confined to a particular station, establishment or ship- first instance when the entire service joined the revolt.
    -   Directed against the British government as a whole- not a single officer, British or Indian, was harmed.
    -   Fearless action by the masses was an expression of militancy in the popular mind. Revolt in the armed forces had a great liberating effect on the minds of people.
-   **Aftermath**
    -   The leaders realized that any mass uprising would inevitably carry the risk of not being amenable to centralized direction and control. Besides, now that independence and power were in sight, they were eager not to encourage indiscipl link ine in the armed forces.
        -   Gandhi- mutiny was badly advised, waited for guidance of their leaders.
    -   Immediately after this revolt - PM ATTLEE dispatched the Cabinet Mission to India, inferred that the mutiny hastened the process of transfer of power to India.
    -   Revolt came to an end after severe repression as well as after the nationalist leaders, SARDAR PATEL and MOHAMMAD ALI JINNAH on receiving a request to intervene by the British, issued a statement calling upon the mutineers to surrender.

#### CABINET MISSION-1946 (75 years in 2021)

-   After INA,RIN revolts and elections in 1946 which gave INC and ML majorities with huge margin, British withdrawl imminet now
    -   Even demoralisation among bureaucracy and other loyalist sections
    -   Limitations of British strategy of concillation and repression
    -   Ann entirely official rule impossible
-   Aim of British - graceful withdrawl after settlements on transfer of power and focus on post-imperial Indo-British relations
-   **Main proposals of Cabinet mission**
    -   Rejection of Pakistan
    -   Grouping of existing assembly on three sections A,B,C
    -   Three tier govt with autonomy at provinces, princely, union levels, residual powers to provinces
    -   Provincial assembly to elect and princely state to nominate members to constituent assembly
    -   Common centre for defence,communication and external affairs
    -   In future province free to come out of the the groupings
-   **Interpretaions**
    -   Congress claimed groupings optional but ML groupings compulsory(Mission favoured this)
    -   Acceptance by ML followed by INC but ML withdrew from plan after Nehru statement that not bounnd by anything, Direct action day for pakistan
    -   Even in Interim goct- ML obstructionist approach and demanded dissolution of Const assembly.
-   **Analysis**
    -   Lost opportunity for united India
-   **Why congress accepted Partition**
    1.  Accepting inevitable due to increased communal movt that INM became
    2.  Immediate transfer of power only could have forestall the communal violence
    3.  Partition plan ruled out independence for princely states which might have led to balkanisation
    4.  It was only final act of process step-by-step concessions. Gandhi's acceptance of right of self determination of Muslim majority provinces during Gandhi-Jinnah talks.
    5.  SARDAR PATEL- if not accept Parition, India would have split into bits, every office would have pakistan, Nehru though that once British left, Hindu-Muslim diff would patch up and united India coud be built

## PERSONALITIES: SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES

(make a comparison table with common subheads such as views on economic, social, caste, women, form of govt, use of violence, political process- type of govt)

#### GANDHI (2018)

-   **Gandhi’s thoughts**
    1.  **Ahimsa**: not only non-violence in physical actions but also in thoughts, speech etc, not only in political sphere but also in social, economic and other spheres, Ahmisa inspired by his understanding of religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Christianity, Islam etc.
        1.  Present- intolerance inc in country, ability to change heart of evil doers of today by peace
    2.  **Swarajya**: In HIND SWARAJYA- Swarajya not simply liberation from foreign rule but ensuring a life of dignity all individuals which is possible in RAM RAJYA. (Pol swaraj, eco swaraj, social swaraj etc)
        1.  Present- Eco swaraj still missing- inequality in society, social swaraj- caste based violence, Hathras etc, Pol swaraj- issues wrt to 73rd CAA
    3.  **Satyagraha**: i.e fight for truth. Since the fight is for truth the methodology employed must not be of monster.- The tools of Gandhian Satyagraha was Non Cooperation, Civil Disobedience- inspired by HD THOREAU’S idea of right of individuals to resist if the state does wrong.
        1.  Present- Conformist culture, Need to find truth in society issues rather than agreeing without knowing
    4.  **Views on state**: Gandhi was moral anarchist believing that state is unnecessary evil, incompatible with the idea of non-violence. Even medium state according to him needed some sort of coercion and policing.
        1.  Present- Cant be said relavant- state imp to prevent anarachy in society and for welfare
    5.  **Sarvodaya**: This is Gandhian alternative to Marxist Socialism. Gandhi believed in the idea of class cooperation in place of class conflict. He gave the Trusteeship theory to ensure that fruits of labour is distributed evenly
        1.  Present- relavant
    6.  **Education**: nayee taleem, focus on manual labour to understand hardships of downtrodden, Wardha schemes of education based it.
        1.  Present- Education becoming rote learning, need for urban youth to understand pain of rural, lower classes.
    7.  **International**: Gandhi believed in international inter-dependence
        1.  Relavence in fighting global challanges
-   **Gandhi and independence struggle**
    1.  He truly cared about people. Not just Indians, but, everyone. When the Mahatma announced the call to boycott British clothes, he took the time to visit the mills in Manchester and apologise to the workers. The British weavers never let him apologise and actually cheered his boycott.
    2.  Most political leaders either stay off the religion or use religion for divisive ends. Gandhi did neither. He actively used the religion to unite people.
    3.  By the time Mahatma Gandhi entered the Indian politics in 1914, he had already spent 21 years in the South African civil rights movement. He had the academic credibility from London and the street credibility from South Africa. Then he spent years touring India and observed from a very perceptive lens.
    4.  Mahatma adhered to truth no matter what comes. Mahatma’s truth and character inspired Businessmen, world leaders, judges etc.
    5.  There is an immense power in simplicity. Mahatma kept the whole movement very simple and transparent therefore connected with masses well. He travelled through trains, met people and bonded with the common man.
    6.  Gandhi simplified revolution to a DIY (Do it Yourself) sort of culture. He made people create salt in the coastal areas. He made people create their own clothes. He made people do very simple things as mark of protest. People were completely involved and enchanted.
    7.  He was a person who said what he thought, and did what he said. There was a complete harmony between thought, words and action.
-   **Gandhi vs British**
    1.  Gandhi was never against the evil doer but against the evil.
    2.  For example, during the World Wars and Boer wars Gandhiji supported Britishers because he doesn’t want to get independence on the misery of British Govt.
    3.  This made Gandhi’s image more refined among British parliamentarians and helped the conservative and labour party realise the gravity of freedom struggle in India.

**PYQ**

Thoughts of Gandhi and relevance in present context (cover thoughts on various contexts)

-   Covered above, some ideas like state, ramrajya in orthodox villages where caste still plays a major role, thoughts on machines in the age IR 4.0, excessive suffering in realist world(surgical strikes also imp)
