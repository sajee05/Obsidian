## ROBOTICS

2015: Challenges posed by Robots? Areas of prohibitive labour? Initiatives taken and needed?

-   **Robotics**: is the field of Science and Technology that deals with the design, manufacture, and applications of robots and using computers for their manipulation and processing
-   **Robot**: means self – labour. India has only three robots for every 10,000 workers as per IFR report

### Applications

#### Space

-   Tackling constraints of manned missions using humanoid eg: **VYOMAMITRA** (**ISRO**)
-   Assist humans in space eg: Robotic hands to lift heavy objects
-   Rovers can move and collect samples

#### Military

-   **MUNTRA** - India’s first Unmanned Tank developed by **DRDO** used to detect mines
-   Drones
-   Robots can reduce casualties in conflict situations (dealing with Guriella warfare **LWE**)
-   Intelligence gathering

#### Industry

-   Used for good delivery to remote areas
-   Automotive industry (largest adopter of robotics in India) - **BRABO** Robot used by **TATA MOTORS**
-   Using robots for education, legal ad vice

#### Agriculture

-   Using robots for regular works such as spraying fertilizers, **AGRIBOT** – an agricultural robot to work on fields.
-   Prevent attacks of wild animals
-   Monitor crops using drones

#### Health

-   Corona care eg: **KARMI** Bot
-   **AIIMS**- Robotic surgery on patient (easy procedure, lesser incision, less pain & blood loss)
-   Elderly care
-   Self care- personal robots to tackle mental heath issues

#### Prohibitive Labour

-   **BANDICOOT** robot for Manual scavneging
-   Mining robots (Exploration work by going beneath the earth)
-   Monotonous work
-   Disaster management- use where humans cant go for relief & response

#### Cultural Preservation & Sports

-   Robotic leather puppet preserving the ‘**THOLPAVAKKOOTHU**’ at **KERALA**’s museum
-   **BHAVINA PATEL** credited her paralympic medal to the **TT** Robot that improved her game (brought by her using **TOPS** Scheme by **SAI**)

### Challenges posed by Robots

-   Negates **GANDHI** emphasis on doing manual labour for developing humility
-   Personal dependence on robots- neglects human cooperation- increase mental health issues
-   Increase electricity usage- carbon foorprint inc
-   Fears of **AI** induced Robots- control the controller
-   On average, each newly installed robot displaces 1.6 manufacturing workers **INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF ROBOTICS** Report

### However

-   **The lump of labor fallacy**: is the assumption that there is a fixed amount of work to be done. If this were true, new jobs could not be generated, just redistributed. Those who believe the **fallacy** have often felt threatened by new technology or the entrance of new people into the **labor** force.
-   Need for prohibitive sectors (**MS**, pandemics, mining, nuclear radiation etc)
-   As per **ILO FUTURE OF WORK REPORT 2019** said robotics will create jobs but those who lose jobs will be least equipped (thus there is need for skill enhancement, social protection, people at the centre of economic & social policy)

### Impediments to Robotic industry in India

-   High importance dependence
-   Lack of financial incentives such that **GST** + customs on import is very high
-   High cost of deployment

## RENEWABLE AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES

2013: Run-of river hydroelectricity project? Differences?

[https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/arun-3-hydro-project](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/arun-3-hydro-project)

### Run-of-the-river Project

-   **Run-of-the-river hydroelectric projects**: are hydroelectric systems that harvest the energy from flowing water to generate electricity.
-   The primary difference between this type of hydroelectric generation compared to others is that run-of-the-river primarily uses the natural flow rate of water to generate power—instead of the power of water falling from a height.
-   For a run-of-the-river system to be possible in a given location, there needs to be two specific geographical features:
    -   A substantial flow rate, either from rainfall or a melting snowpack.
    -   There must be enough of a tilt to the river to speed the water up significantly.
-   The **ARUN-3 HYDRO ELECTRIC PROJECT** (900 MW) is a run-of-river located on **ARUN RIVER** in **EASTERN NEPAL** made with **INDIAN** investement help.
-   Features and differences with large hydro projects
    -   These are less expensive to build and can be built over a shorter period of time.
    -   They have a smaller environmental footprint when compared to dams with large amounts of water storage.
    -   However, the output from run-of-the-river system is significantly lower than large scale hydro projects, which increases the cost per **KWH** as compared to Dam based hydroelectric generation.
    -   The manipulation of river flows can cause a significant number of environmental impacts affecting the aquatic ecosystem.

### Alternative Fuels for Transport

#### Characteristics, advantages and disadvantages (eg: hydrogen, green charcoal also in news)

#### Introduction

-   **INDIA** is heavily dependent on fossil fuels for its energy requirements and therefore, needs to identify renewable fuel sources which would help reduce import of petroleum crude.
    -   Alternative fuel should reach the remotest corners so that the poorest of the poor can be provided fuel at an affordable price.
-   The only non-renewable solid fuel that is still controlling the world's energy sector is coal, in view of the restricted utilisation of nuclear energy. The replacement of liquid fuel is a near difficult task in the coming several decades. So the world is slowly towards the use of hydrogen as the replacement of liquid fuels.

#### Types of Alternative Fuels

1.  **Ethanol**: Primarily alcohol is produced from fermentation of sugars found in crops like corn, barley, sugarcane bagasse, wheat. etc. It is blended with gasoline to increase octane level and improve emission quality
2.  **Natural Gas**: Derived while extracting crude oil (about 6.2% of the entire energy consumption)
3.  **LPG**: The other name is propane; Byproduct of crude oil refining and natural gas processing. It is widely used as cooking gas and a popular alternative fuel
4.  **Biodiesel**: it is one of the fuels whose source is always renewable, It can be produced from vegetable oils or animal fats/oils. Vehicle engines can be converted to run by pure biodiesel and it is also blended with petroleum diesel to run in modified engines also.
5.  **Methanol**: is formed due to hydrogenation of carbon monoxide; **CO2** generated from burning methanol can again be captured and converted to methanol (perpetual recycling of **C02**)
6.  **Electricity**: Electricity can be used as a transportation alternative fuel for battery-powered electric and fuel-cell vehicles
7.  **Hydrogen**: U can be mixed with natural gas to create an alternative fuel which can be used in some types of internal combustion engines. Hydrogen is the fuel for fuel-cell vehicles and is produced by the petrochemical reaction.

### Waste to Energy

#### Techniques, potential, efforts, challenges

-   **Waste-to-Energy (WtE)** or **Energy-from-Waste (EfW)**: is a form of energy recovery and the process of generating energy in the form of electricity and/or heat by processing of waste into a fuel source. Waste to energy generates clean, reliable energy from a renewable fuel source
-   A modern, properly run waste-to-energy plant sorts material before burning it and can co-exist with recycling.A few plants use gasification, but most combust the waste directly because it is a mature, efficient technology.
-   Typically, about 50 tonnes of Refuse Derived Fuel generate 1 MW of power

#### Benefits of wastes to energy plants:

1.  In terms of volume, usually waste-to-energy plants incinerate 80 to 90 percent of waste, thus helping large cities from choking due to unmanageable waste.
2.  Most wastes that are generated find their way into land and water bodies without proper treatment, causing severe water and air pollution.
3.  Reducing dependence on fossil fuels, the combustion of which is a major contributor to **GHG** emissions
4.  Residue ash is clean enough to be used for other purpose eg: raw materials for for road construction
5.  Metals that may be burned are collected from the bottom of the furnace and sold to foundries
6.  It is carbon-negative – processing waste into biofuel releases considerably less carbon and methane into the air than having waste decay away in landfills or the lake

#### Challenges faced in installing Waste-to-Energy plants:

1.  Technology suppliers are international organisations who struggle with the change in quality and nature of waste generated in **INDIAN** cities. A few plants in **INDIA** have stopped operations for this reason.
2.  Waste-to-Energy is still a new concept in **INDIA**. Most of the proven and commercial technologies in respect of urban wastes are required to be imported.
3.  The costs of the projects are high as critical equipment for a project is required to be imported.
4.  In view of low level of compliance of **SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT RULES, 2016** by the **MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS/ URBAN LOCAL BODIES**, segregated municipal solid waste is generally not available at the plant site, which leads to non-availability of waste-to-energy plants.
5.  Lack of financial resources with **MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS/URBAN LOCAL BODIES**.
6.  ![GS3 Science Technology](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Science Technology 4.jpeg>)Tariff at which the power is purchased by such plants across the country is around **RS.7-8 KWH** which is higher than the **RS.3-4 PER KWH** generated through coal and other means.

-   **Pyrolysis**: defined as a process of temperature decomposition of organic material in the absence of oxygen - syngas is produced
-   **Incineration**: Combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. Heat → Steam → Turbines
-   **Fermentation**: changes in organic substrates through the action of enzymes
-   **Anaerobic digestion**: digestion in the absence of oxygen
-   **Gasification**: Conversion of waste into gases eg: Biogas

#### Conclusion:

-   Urban local bodies (**ULBS**) should invest in preparing an action plan on waste management in accordance with the **SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT (SWM) RULES, 2016** within a time-bound approach and promote and adopt the key elements of waste hierarchy as refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.
-   This will not only improve effectiveness of Waste To Energy’s, but will also ensure protection and improvement of our environment as envisaged in **ARTICLE 51 A(G)** of our **CONSTITUTION**.
-   Measures taken: Setting up of Compressed biogas (**CBG**) plant has been brought under **PSL** norms

### Biogas Technology Uses? Govt. measures?

-   Wood as fuel - contains a very less amount of carbon plus major amount of impurities such as sulphur, chlorine, silicon and water decrease its efficiency as a fuel- results in the production of a large amount of smoke and ash.
-   But when wood is converted to charcoal by removing volatile impurities and water- get an excellent fuel with higher efficiency and low production of smoke.
-   Similar observations can be noted for biomass.
-   Cow dung cakes are used as fuel- large amount of smoke and ash is generated. Biomass - modify for getting a better fuel (bio gas)

#### What is Biogas?

-   **Biogas**: refers to a mixture of gases produced by the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter such as agricultural waste, municipal waste, plant residue, food waste etc. Biogas consists of methane, carbon dioxide along with the small amount of hydrogen sulphide, and moisture.

#### What is a Biogas Plant?

-   After a few days anaerobic decomposition of orgainic waste, the organic matter completely decomposes to generate gases like methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide. These gases are then drawn through pipes from the storage tank above the digester and distributed.

#### Advantages of Biogas

-   Non-polluting: Biogas burns without smoke; hence no harmful gas such as **CO2**, **CO**, **NO2**, and **SO2** are evolved.
-   Reduces Landfills: The slurry produced after the production of biogas is used as manure in fields. The method of disposal is safe and efficient and hence no space is wasted in the form of landfills.
-   Cheaper technology: Biogas plants require very little installation cost and become self-sufficient in a span of 3-4 months.
-   Generates employment: in rural areas.eg **IFS**
-   Renewable source of energy: As dependent on the generation of waste which is an endless process.

#### Disadvantages of Biogas

-   Not efficient enough on a large scale: Since it is difficult to enhance the efficiency of biogas, it is not economically viable to use biogas on a large scale
-   Contains impurities: It contains many impurities which are difficult to be controlled even after rounds of purification. Biogas when compressed, to be used as fuel, proves to be highly corrosive to the container
-   Unstable and hazardous: When methane comes in contact with oxygen it reacts violently to produce carbon dioxide. The highly inflammable nature of methane makes it prone to explosions

#### Govt measures

-   **PMJIVAN**
    -   promoting **SECOND GENERATION (2G) BIOFUELS TECHNOLOGY** (primarily ethanol) moving away from food crops used in **FIRST GENERATION (1G)** to feedstocks, nonfood crops agricultural residues or waste.
-   **NATIONAL BIOGAS AND ORGANIC MANURE PROGRAMME**.
    -   setting up of **FAMILY TYPE BIOGAS PLANTS** mainly for rural and semi-urban/households
-   **GOBAR-DHAN** scheme- collected organic wastes from rural villages and then converting biodegradable waste into compressed biogas (**CBG**)
    -   Also help in estb community-based **CBG** plants in rural areas
    -   Promoting **SECOND GENERATION (2G) BIOFUELS TECHNOLOGY**' and increase farmers income
![GS3 Science Technology](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Science Technology 5.jpeg>)
-   Examples of biofuels include ethanol (often made from corn in the **UNITED STATES** and sugarcane in **BRAZIL**), biodiesel(sourced from vegetable oils and liquid animal fats), green diesel (derived from algae and other plant sources), and biogas(methane derived from animal manure and other digested organic material)

## NUCLEAR ENERGY

### Stats:

-   Currently account for 2% of energy requirement (Current 7 GW → 275 GW by 2052)

### India’s Stand on different Nuclear Treaties

#### Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT):

-   Signed in 1968; Requires countries to give up any present or future plans to build nuclear weapons in return for access to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 3 main objectives are non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful use of nuclear tech. **INDIA**’s stand is follows:
    -   5 states are permitted to possess nuclear weapons while other have to remain non-nuclear weapon states - **INDIA** rather wants complete disarmament
    -   Act as restriction on **INDIA**’s political autonomy and foreign policy choices

#### Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT):

-   intends to ban all nuclear explosions - everywhere, by everyone. Opened for signature in 1996. The Treaty will enter into force after all 44 States listed in Annex 2 to the Treaty will ratify it. **INDIA**’s stand is follows:
    -   **US** rejected **INDIA**’s demand to present a schedule for eliminating its nuclear stockpile
    -   **INDIA** believes that the universal and complete nuclear disarmament should be the end goal not a mean
    -   Treaty is vague on the ban of laboratory testing of nuclear weapons

#### Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG):

-   Formed after 1974 **POKHRAN** Test. It’s a group of nuclear supplier countries that seek to contribute to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons through the implementation of two sets of Guidelines for nuclear exports and nuclear-related exports. A non-**NPT** state cannot become a member of **NSG** which keeps **INDIA** out of the group
    -   Though **INDIA** is not a member of **NPT** and **NSG**, its track-record in observing the provisions of either body, is impeccable. **NSG** was able to **grant a waiver** to **INDIA** in 2008 on the basis of its past performance, now it should have no objection to admitting the country as a member

2018: With growing energy needs should India keep on expanding its nuclear energy programme? Discuss the facts and fears associated with nuclear energy

#### Stats showing growing needs:

-   **INDIAN** energy demand grows at 4% annually, and is expected to increase from 700 million tonnes of oil equivalent (**MTOE**) in 2010 to 1,500 **MTOE** by 2030. In this, nuclear energy comes out as a clean source of energy for future

#### Need to expand nuclear energy program(merits)

-   Import dependence and increasing and **CAD** due to fossil fuel import; (target to reduce bill 10% by 2022)
-   Environmentally friendly nature of nuclear tech allows to pursure **UNFCCC** goals- reduce **GHG**
-   Strategic partnership among nations eg: **US** relation improved after **INDO-US** nuclear agreement
-   Continous supply of energy (as not dependent on weather unlike sun/wind)- Nuclear power plants run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
-   Achieve energy security
-   National security - can be diverted in case of war

#### Apprehension/Challenges

-   Depended on Bilateral relations- Raw material supply dependent on **US 123** agreement.
-   Anti-nuclear protests: Following the 2011 **FUKUSHIMA** nuclear disaster in **JAPAN**, populations around proposed **INDIAN NUCLEAR** power plant sites have launched protests. E.g. Protests in **JAITAPUR** protests and **MITHI VIRDI**.
-   Threat from increasing disasters make coastal nuclear plants vulnerable to cyclones (2011 **FUKUSHIMA**)
-   Reactor's safety: Nuclear reactors are unsafe; **CHERNOBYL** disaster resulted in a huge death toll.
-   Nuclear waste: Radioactive radiation, need highly precision nuclear waste mgmt system
-   Fear of being used for making nuclear bombs: Reprocessing spent fuel gives rise to plutonium which is likely to be used in bombs
-   Uranium contamination in groundwater from aquifers in 16 **INDIAN** states (due to mining of uranium)
-   Reactor's cost: cost at least billion dollars to be built
-   Cyber security - challanges of getting hacked by non state actor

#### Issues in implementation

-   Land acquisition -**NPP**’s like **KUDANKULAM** in **TAMIL NADU** and **KOVVADA** in **ANDHRA PRADESH** have met with several delays due to the land acquisition related challenges.
-   Future challanges in sustainable mining of monazite sands for thorium in **KERELA**
-   Manpower issues , technology

2016: Give an account of the growth and development of nuclear science and technology in India. What is the advantage of fast breeder reactor programme in India?

-   Milestones covered below in next answer
-   The advantage with a breeder reactor is that it generates more fissile material than it consumes
-   This technology does not contribute to air pollution, except during mining and processing of Uranium ore.
-   Breeder reactors use a small core, which is important to sustain chain reactions.
-   Besides, they do not even need moderators for slowing down neutrons, as they use fast neutrons.

### Indian Nuclear Programme: Phases, milestones, 3 staged process

#### Milestones of Indian Program:

-   1948: **ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION** to explore raw material
-   1969: 1st Boiling water reactor at **TARAPUR** (collab with **USA**)
-   1974: **OPERATION SMILING BUDDHA**
-   Nuclear aparthied- indigenous driven nuclear prog
-   1998: **POKHRAN** Tests → No-first-use policy
-   2013: Achieved second stage in **KUNDAKULAM**

#### Raw material status-India lack of uranium-only 2% of world- focused on recycling of spent fuell and utilisation of thorium(32% of world reserves)

-   Uranium Reserves: 70k tonnes (of which 99% is Ur 238 and balance Ur 233); Thorium Reserves: 360k tonnes
![GS3 Science Technology](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Science Technology 6.jpeg>)
-   Institutional- **BHABHA ATOMIC RESEARCH CENTRE (BARC)**- for Nuclear **R&D**, **NUCLEAR POWER CORP OF INDIA** (operate N power stations), **D/O ATOMIC ENERGY** (overall cord), **URANIUM CORP OF INDIA** (exploratory body)
1.  1st stage: Use domestic and imported uranium (easy supply after **US** agreement) Ur 238 + n > Pu 239
2.  2nd stage: (**AKSHAY PATRA**)
    -   Pu 239 + depeleted Ur > Pu 239
    -   Blanket of thorium > Ur 233
3.  3rd stage:
    -   Ur 233 + thorium > Ur 233
-   In **FBRS**, plutonium-239 undergoes fission to produce energy, while the uranium-238 present in the fuel transmutes to additional plutonium-239. Furthermore, once a sufficient amount of plutonium-239 is built up, thorium will be used in the reactor, to produce Uranium-233. This uranium is crucial for the third stage

### Civilian, economic and defence needs fulfilled by nuclear programme (Applications)

#### Medicine

-   Used as fuel space exploration
-   Used in desalinisation plants
-   Material analysis
-   Determine flow rates in oil & gas exploration

#### Agriculture

-   Food preservation: foods are exposed to gamma rays to get rid of microbes eg: Presently fruits like Mango and Pomegranate and vegetable like onions and garlic are being irradiated for shelf life extension.
-   Plant breeding: **BARC** has developed more than 1800 new crop varities through mutation; **DAE** has developed 42 varieties in oilseeds
-   Subsidy is granted to radiation processing plants under **SAMPADA** scheme

### Fission vs Fusion
![GS3 Science Technology](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Science Technology 1.png>)

## IPR AND ITS RELATED ISSUES

### Basics:

-   Invention(novelty) vs Innovation (on existing product)- Invention key to patenting, innovation patenting - need standard criteria to grant patent
-   **IPR**: are the rights given to persons over the creations of their minds eg: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, etc.
-   **IPR** aims to create an environment where creativity and innovation can foster
-   Also recognised under the **ARTICLE 27** of **UNIVERSAL DECL. OF HR**

### Merits of India’s IPR regime

-   **SEC 3(D) OF PATENT ACT**: Prevents evergreening of patent unless their is significant improvement- help in public health emergecy - generic drugs for domestic and export
-   **COMPLULSORY LICENSING**: ensures that drug is not very expensive, available to most people(eg **BAYER**’s drug- 2.8 Lakh per month vs 8800 per month (**NATCO**)-kidney cancer drug- got **CL**
    -   **WTO DOHA ROUND**- each nation sov to grant **CL** for public health need
-   **OXFORD UNIVERSITY VS RAMESHWARI PHOTOCOPY CASE**- **DELHI HC**- As mentioned in exception to copyright regime for study material, **HC** allowed photcopying portion for wider knowledge to people- help poor students
-   **NOVARTIS** case

### Issues in India’s patent regime

-   **SECT 84 OF PATENT ACT**: Compulsory licensing is a seen as an impediment to innovation by innovators
    -   **Compulsory licensing**: -ves: Promotes grey markets; No comprehensive definition of ‘national emergency’ (As per the **INDIAN PATENTS ACT, 1970**, a compulsory license can be granted for the patents after the expiry of three years of grant of patent)
    -   Issues to **INDIA**- Issues in granting smooth **CL**- litigations
-   Poor enforcement of **IPR** promoting culture of piracy
-   **INDIA** continues to remain on the **USTR**’s **SPECIAL 301 REPORT** ‘Priority Watch List’ for alleged violations of **IPR**
-   **IPR** policy recommends scientist to cover all discoveries into **IP**- hampers frugal innovation over them due to free flow of knowledge
    -   Poor quality of patent issue- eg in **CHINA** after their **IPR** policy
    -   Learn from **JAGDISH CHANDRA BOSE** who advocated for open system of knowledge
-   Developed nations want **TRIPS(+)** (which will be outside **WTO**); They want data exclusivity (protection of clinical test data so that that generic drug dev have to conduct their own trials again)

### Measure taken

-   **NATIONAL INNOVATION POLICY**
    -   Creating robust national innovation system, **INDIA**-specific focus on inclusive growth,promote scientific temper,Linking research and action, promote **STEM** careers
-   **NATIONAL IPR POLICY 2016** (admin by **DIPP**)
    -   Aims to promote **IP**, set up institutions for imp,mom,review and incorporate global best practices
    -   7 objectives of **IPR** Policy- **IPR** Awareness, Generation of **IPR**’s, Legal laws to balance **IPR** and public interest, Modern Administration of **IPR**, Commercialisation of **IPR**, Enforcement and Adjudication, Human capital dev
    -   Benefits:
        -   Fin support to less empowered for **IPR** protection eg farmer,weavers,artisans
        -   Bring down window time of registration to one month
        -   Tax benefits, simplify laws, stable **IPR** regime to domestic and foreign
-   **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY APPELLATE BOARD**
    -   Hear appeals against Registrar under **TM**,**GI**,patents.
    -   Tribunal with global impact
-   **INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS**
    -   **TRIPS**: **TRIPS AGREEMENT** btw **WTO** members - introduced global minimum standards (national laws, dispute stellement,grant of rights to owners etc) for protecting and enforcing nearly all forms of intellectual property rights (**IPR**), including those for patents wef 1995
    -   **WIPO**: Specialised agency of **UN**
        -   Responsible for promotion/protection of **IPR** whole world- admin of **IPR** treaties
        -   Objectives
            -   Increase capacity of developing C in patent creation, their ability to acquire foreign patents and technology
            -   Under **TRIP**- gives legislative, human resource, institutional advise
-   Success:
    -   **INDIA**’s rank in the **GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX (GII)** issued by **WIPO** has improved from 81st in 2015 to 52nd place in 2019.
    -   Increase in Patent and trademark Filings; Increase in **IPR** Awareness through ‘**IPR NANI**’ Scheme
    -   **INDIA** made **COWIN** platform open-source (ie no **IPR** attached) - so that it can serve global good

Probable Question: **INDIA** & **SOUTH AFRICA** submitted a joint petition to **WTO** for requesting temporary suspension of **TRIPS** (for **COVID-19** treatment)

-   Benefits of Patents: Moral and natural right to claim over their inventions; Utalitarian premise that exclusive licenses promote invetions; People must be allowed to bear the fruits of their labour
-   Refuting above objections: During **COVID-19**, the pvt. organisation could earn patent only after basic research of efficacy was conducted by various public run institutions and hospitals; Research is driven only for diseases that affect developed world (leading Tropical diseases); Patents are seen as the only means to promote innovation which is not true
-   Other solutions: Replacing patents with patent prizes (as advocated by **JOSESH STIGLITZ**)

2019: Protecting traditional knowledge of medicine from patenting; 2015: **TKDL**: Pros & cons of making it under open source licensing

#### Legislative Framework:

-   **BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ACT 2002**: Provision for fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of genetic resources (role of local level committees part of 3 tier structure)
-   **FOREST RIGHTS ACT 2006**: provides for community rights over forest resources
-   **GI ACT 1999**: right to the holders of the traditional knowledge associated with a particular geographical area

#### International Cooperation:

-   Under **NAGOYA PROTOCOL OF CBD**
-   Agreements have been signed with various international patent offices to prevent the grant of invalid patents

#### Policy Measures:

-   **TKDL** Initiative
-   **NATIONAL AYUSH MISSION** conducted to bring awareness of our traditional knowledge
-   Research Centres and National Institutes have been created across **INDIA** in the fields of **AYURVEDA**, **UNANI**, **HOMOEOPATHY**, **SIDDHA**
-   People register of Bio-Diversity- compile tradional knowledge which has passed through oral-oral route iin generations
-   **CSIR** files objection at Int patent office- eg when yoga method patent filed in **US**

### TKDL Initiative

-   **The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL)**: is an **INDIAN** digital knowledge repository of the traditional knowledge. It was setup in 2001 and is a collaboration between **CSIR** and **M/O AYUSH**
-   Prevent misappropriation of tradional knowledge by foreigners (eg medicinal uses of neem and turmeric) through bio-piracy by listing it in international patent list
-   Available in five languages: English, German, French, Japanese and Spanish- knowledge of ayurveda,unani,siddha etc
-   Intends to act as a bridge between information recorded in ancient **SANSKRIT** and patent examiners abroad

#### Pros of open source:

-   Prevent invalid patent, save legal costs
-   Protection to traditional knowledge

#### Cons of open source:

-   Lawyers can work around the existing info given in the database to secure their patent
-   Might be used to earn corporate profits w/o giving due credit and references

**IPR** in global discourse; Role of **TRIPS**; Steps taken to confirm to **TRIPS**? Concerns of **INDIA** towards new **IPR** discussions

-   For instance, **PEPSI CO**’s formula for producing **PEPSI** is considered a trade secret.
-   In **INDIA**, no specific law governs trade secrets, but it is accorded protection by the Courts through interpretation of natural law, principles of equity and common law, and the **CONTRACT ACT**.

#### Geographical Indications:

-   It is a sign used on agricultural or natural or manufactured goods when they originate or are manufactured in a particular region of a country.
-   Specific quality, characteristic or reputation of the product is essentially attributable to that origin.
-   Governed by **THE GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS OF GOODS (REGISTRATION & PROTECTION) ACT, 1999**
-   eg: **DARJEELING TEA**, **KADAKNATH CHICKEN (MP)**

#### Design:

-   Consists of the creation of a shape, composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value.
-   Eg: Design of **APPLE IPHONE**; Designs in **INDIA** are governed by **THE DESIGNS ACT 2000**

#### What stimulates innovation?

### Indian Patent Law 1970; Section 3d Analyse? SC Judgement? Pros and cons?

-   **Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act 1970 (as amended in 2005)**: does not allow patent to be granted to inventions involving new forms of a known substance unless it differs significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.
    -   This means that the **INDIAN PATENT ACT** does not allow evergreening of patents.
    -   This has been a cause of concern to the pharma companies. Section 3(d) was instrumental in the **INDIAN PATENT OFFICE (IPO)** rejecting the patent for **NOVARTIS** drug **GLIVEC**

## R&D, MISCELLANEOUS TOPICS

### Background

-   Investments in **R&D** are key inputs in economic growth. The impact of this is proven on productivity, exports, employment and capital formation.
-   In the decades following independence, this choice of self-reliance had placed **INDIA** ahead of most developing countries. However **INDIA** did not modernize these industries and missed the third industrial revolution. The private sector stayed content with near-monopoly conditions in non-core sectors (**BOMBAY PLAN**)
-   Post **NEP 1991**, focus shifted to importing cheaper **R&D** to fuel indigenous efforts. However, there was inadequate absorption of these imported technologies
-   **INDIA**'s gross domestic expenditure on **R&D (GERD)** stands at 0.7% of **GDP** (compared to **BRAZIL** 1.3, **CHINA** 2.1)
-   **INDIA**: Top exporter of **IT** products, ‘Pharmacy of the world’,
-   **INDIA** is at the 48th position in the list of top 50 innovative countries as per **GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2020** (Rank 52 in 2019) - shown a consistent improvement in its innovation ranking

### Data from R&D Statistics and Indicators 2019-20 by D/o ST

-   The number of researchers per million population has doubled since 2000. It has increased to 255 in 2017 from 110 in 2000
-   Women participation in extramural **R&D** projects has increased significantly to 24% in 2016-17 from 13% in 2000-01
-   According to **WIPO**, **INDIA**’s Patent Office stands at the 7th position among the top 10 Patent Filing Offices in the world
-   **INDIA**’s investment in **R&D** has shown a consistent increasing trend over the years. However remained between around 0.6% to 0.7%

### Challenges

-   Government expenditure, almost entirely the **CENTRAL GOVERNMENT**, is the driving force of **R&D** in **INDIA** which is in contrast to the advanced countries where the private sector is the dominant and driving force of **R&D** spend
    -   Government’s participation in **R&D** in the other countries ranged from seven percent in **U.K.** to 38 % in **MEXICO**, as against **INDIA**’s 55%
    -   **INDIA** only 0.7% comp to **CHINA** 2%(pvt sector only 0.2%)
    -   Shortcomings of the **INDIAN** university system has been the focus on basic research rather than application research- disconnect btw academia and imp lab
    -   Weak **IPR** regime - ineffective, inadequate - backlog of almost 2 lakh patents pending examination
    -   Though number of journals are increasing - they are not so impactful (not highly citited)
    -   Global unfair competition practised by **CHINA** (to counter that we need push towards **R&D**)

### Measures taken

-   Emphasis on collaborative **R&D** by **CPSE**s and **IITS/UNIVERSITIES** to work on market oriented research
-   Weighted deduction provisions available in **INCOME TAX ACT** for inhouse and **R&D** contributions
-   **MAKE IN INDIA**
-   **NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE NETWORK** by **M/O HRD**
-   **ATAL INNOVATION MISSION** by **NITI AAYOG**: to promote the culture of innovation, **R&D** in **INDIA**
-   **NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION** - to coordinate research funding in **INDIA**
-   **DRAFT NATIONAL SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION POLICY, 2020**
-   **DRAFT SCIENTIFIC SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY**
-   Promotion of one person companies can promote startups which inturn fuel innovation
-   Collaboration in international projects such as **LARGE HADRON COLLIDER**
-   **DRAFT STIP** (new policy) 2020: Aims to double **GERD**, no of **FTE** researchers, pvt sector contribution to **GERD**; Also aims for “one nation, one subscription” solution

### Way Forward

-   Need for greater participation of **STATE GOVERNMENTS** and the private sector in overall **R&D** spending
-   Need for a hawk eye like focus - as done by **CHINA** rose from 276 patents in 1999 to global leader in 2019
-   Learn from global models such as that of **SINGAPORE**, **SOUTH KOREA** who spend 3-5% on **R&D** along with 4-6% on education & skill development
-   **EAC-PM** recommended:
    -   **R&D** exp must reach at least 2% of **GDP** by 2022
    -   minimum percentage of turnover of medium and large enterprises be invested in **R&D**
    -   creating 30 dedicated **R&D EXPORTS HUB**
    -   Mandate ministries at centre to allocate a certain percentage of their budget for research and innovation
-   **CPSE**s of the petroleum and power sector are the biggest spenders in **R&D**. Other need to follow suit
-   Address the data gaps in compiling **R&D** data so that it could reflect **INDIA**’s true rank globally
-   **ECONOMIC SURVEY** said **INDIA**’s business sector needs to rise to the occasion and significantly ramp up its gross expenditure on **R&D** to a level commensurate to **INDIA**’s status as the fifth largest economy. This requires boosting business sector contribution to total **GERD** from 37 per cent currently, to close to 68 per cent — the average business contribution in **GERD** of other top 10 economies
-   Need to learn from **US SENATE** which approved **$170BN+ INNOVATION BILL** (mainly to surging economic threat from rival **CHINA**)

### Conclusion:

-   Higher investments in **R&D** and education are the key areas to become _‘atmanirbhar’_ and should be the focus of our policymakers

## ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE

Causes? Mechanisms for monitoring and control (take example of **MDR-TB**)(2014) **MDR-TB**: What? Measures for containment, Implications of spread

-   **AMR**: happens when microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites) change when they are exposed to antimicrobial drugs(called superbugs after becoming **AMR**)
-   **AMR** occurs naturally over time along as well as other man made reasons; However due to below mentioned reasons are accelerating the same
-   **ICMR** Study found antobiotic resistant organisms in digestive tracts of 2 out of 3 healthy persons it tested
-   **INDIA** is one of the top users of antibiotics. Reasons for **AMR**
-   Inappropriate use of medicines: Overuse, underuse and misuse
-   Lack of quality medicine: Weak drug quality assurance systems leading to poor quality medicines
-   Animal Husbandry: Sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics are used in animal-rearing for promoting growth- transfer **AMR** bacteria from animal to humans
-   Poor infection prevention and control: Hospitalised patients are one of the main reservoirs of resistant microorganisms
-   Contamination around hospitals releases active antimicrobials into env due to inappropriate disposal
-   Inappropriate usage in agriculture
-   Weak surveillance systems: It impairs the ability to detect emergence of resistance and take prompt actions.

### Why is AMR a concern?

-   New resistance mechanisms are emerging and spreading globally,
-   A growing list of infections such as pneumonia, **TB**, blood poisoning and gonorrhea are becoming harder, and sometimes impossible, to treat as antibiotics become less effective.
-   Medical procedures and major surgery become very high risk.
-   **AMR** increases the cost of health care with lengthier stays in hospitals and more intensive care required.
-   **AMR** is putting the gains of the **MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS** at risk and endangers achievement of the **SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS**.

### Govt steps

-   **NATIONAL ANTI-MICROBIAL RESISTANCE RESEARCH AND SURVEILLANCE NETWORK** to strengthen the surveillance of **AMR** by compilation of National Data of **AMR** at different levels of Health Care.
-   **NATIONAL ACTION PLAN** to combat **ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE**
-   **RED LINE CAMPAIGN**’ for antibiotics packaging to curb their over-the-counter sale

### WHO Steps

-   **GLOBAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (GLASS)**: supports a standardized approach to the collection, analysis and sharing of data related to antimicrobial resistance at a global level.
-   **AWARE** tool: aimed at guiding policy-makers and health workers to use antibiotics safely and more effectively.
-   One health approach- to tackle zoonotic diseases by tackling them holistically

### WHO Recommendation(Way forward)

-   Individual: Only use antibiotics when prescribed, Never share or use leftover antibiotics
-   Policy Makers: robust national action plan to tackle **AMR**, Make information available on its impact
-   Health Profesionals/Industry: Talk to your patients about how to take antibiotics correctly, Invest in research and development of new antibiotics
-   Agriculture: use alternatives to antibiotics when available, Only give antibiotics to animals under veterinary supervision
-   Policy alignment is also needed much beyond the health system. Solutions in clinical medicine must be integrated with improved surveillance of **AMR** in agriculture, animal health and the environment. This means that **AMR** must no longer be the remit solely of the health sector, but needs engagement from a wide range of stakeholders, representing agriculture, trade and the environment with solutions that balance their often-competing interests.
-   International alignment and coordination are para mount in both policymaking and its implementation. Indeed, recent papers have proposed using the **PARIS AGREEMENT** _as a blueprint_ for developing a similar global approach to tackling **AMR**.

_Biopharma is nothing but Red BT, therefore use points accordingly_

## STEM CELL THERAPY

2017: Stem cell therapy: merits and demerits; advantages over other treatment? Various genetic diseases

-   **Stem cells**: are the body's raw materials — cells from which all other cells with specialized functions are generated
-   Stem cells divide to form more cells called daughter cells. No other cell in the body has the natural ability to generate new cell types
-   These daughter cells either become new stem cells (self-renewal) or become specialized cells (differentiation) with a more specific function, such as blood cells, brain cells, heart muscle cells or bone cells.
-   **Stem cell therapy**, also known as regenerative medicine, promotes the repair response of diseased/ injured tissue using stem cells or their derivatives

### Types of Stem Cells: (formation at different times of human lives)

-   Embryonic stem cells: Stem cells in early stages of life
-   Adult stem cells: eg: Stem cells in bone marrow
-   Induced pluripotent stem cells or **IPSC**’s: Made in labs

### Advantages over other treatment:

-   Diseases that were earlier considered degenerative, incurable can now be cured eg: diabetes, **PARKINSON**'s, **ALZHEIMER**'s disease
-   Treat blood related disorders such as **LEUKAEMIA**, **THALASSEMIA**
-   a) Lower risk of infection during the immune compromised portion of the treatment. b) Speed up the length of time it takes for injuries or wounds to heal c) Reduce pain, even chronic joint pain, with less need for medications d) Increase functionality, range of motion, flexibility and sleep quality e) Reduce muscle compensations and risk for future injuries
![GS3 Science Technology](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Science Technology 7.jpeg>)
-   f) Decrease nerve damage g) Increase collagen h) Help generate new heart and blood vessel tissue i) Help heal skin wounds, prevent formation of scar tissue and reduce hair loss j) Return patients to their normal activities as quickly as possible

## GENETICS

Basics, Uses, Merits/ Demerits; Projects at **GOI** and Global level; Uses of **DNA** Technology (eg: **DNA** fingerprinting)

### GM Crops - Basics:

-   **Transgenic/ Genetically modified seeds**: are developed by transferring selected genes from one organism into another. (compare them with Hybrid seeds which are developed by cross-breeding / cross-pollination with other plants)
-   Use of the unapproved **GM** variant can attract a jail term of 5 years and fine of **RS. 1 LAKH** under the **EPA, 1986**

#### Merits:

-   Solve issues of food security as crops are much more tolerant to harsh environment, pests
-   Improve yields → Farmer’s income ⬆
-   Environmentally safe as lesser chemical pesticides have to be used
-   Less labour intensive and hence cost friendly
-   Reduced import dependence eg: of pulses

#### Demerits:

-   Biosafety concerns may be unsafe for human and animal consumption (as some traits get revealed only after several generations)
-   Terminator gene allow dev of monopolistic practices eg: **AMERICAN** company **MONSANTO**’s **BOLLGARD**
-   Trait fees can make the whole procedure expensive
-   Promote monoculture practices and hurt crop biodiversity, traditional knowledge
-   Gene crossover to other wild species
-   Regulatory miscarriage

#### Suggestions by Economic Survey

-   We’ve a robust regulatory framework with **GEAC**. So, mischief is unlikely so we should allow **GM** crops with following precautions → 1. Allow **GM** seeds which don’t have Terminator Gene or high cost. 2. Allow **GM** seeds that have following properties: 1) Disease, pest & drought resistant 2) Longer shelf life 3) Shorter crop duration 4) Nonfood / Tree format crops.
-   3. To prevent **MNC** monopoly on **GM** seeds, we’ve to encourage domestic companies

### Gene Editing
![GS3 Science Technology](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Science Technology 8.jpeg>)

-   Basics- **DNA** altered/inserted/replaced in genome of org using molecular scissiors(**CRISPR-CAS9**)

-   Human germline issue-should not transmit to offspring
-   Ecological-can lead to disapperance of entire species
-   Difficult to regualte outside lab
-   Ethical- concern of bio-ethicist- **KANT** violate- no consent of baby
-   Threat to human race- in case 2 diff genes make new species- difficult to predict exact functioning

#### Way Forward

-   Transparency and due care
-   Int agreed principles- for common humanity
-   Equity-should not increase inequality- share with world

#### Govt Efforts

-   **MANAV HUMAN ATLAS INITIATIVE**-create atlas of human body-every tissue,molecule,cell- understand role in various diseases, precision drug and drug delivery

    -   Scientific community can conduct research in astronomy to meteorology to biology and medicine.
-   Other spacecraft can dock- cross cultural collab experiments with countries
-   Help provide more room for astronauts to live and carry out experiments over longer time frames.
-   **ISS** expected to become redundant from 2024-28- so not benefical to only join **ISS**
    -   **INDIA** could not have been a part of the **ISS** as excluded from such projects because of **DELHI**’s nuclear policy.
-   Major commercial and strategic benefits(Future of space weaponisation), maintain leadership in space
-   Agriculture: Seeds exposed to cosmic radiations & zero gravity can produce better yields when planted back on earth (eg: Space rice by **CHINA**)

#### Challenges:

-   After the **GANGANYAAN** project -pose important challenges like approval and finance.
-   The **ISS** costs **$3 BILLION** a year (**RS. 20,000 CRORES**) and 6.50,000 crore in assembling.- Financial issue
-   require a plan to upgrade the payload carrying capacity of the **GSLV MARK III** for space station requirements- frequent travel

#### Way forward

-   Involve Private sector like **SPACE-X** helps **NASA** in docking astronauts
-   Need specialised astranauts and traning centre

#### Conclusion:

-   Need to recreate astonishment in world like **MOM**

### IRNSS

Need for **IRNSS**, Advantages; Meaning of ‘Standard Positioning Systems’ and ‘Protection Positioning Systems’ in the **GPS** era (2018(**GS1**),2015,2008)

-   **GPS** provides 2 types of services:
    -   **SPS**: Used for civilian purposes and used standard receiver and technology
    -   **PPS**: Used for military puropses (however this precision can be used in mining, etc as well)
-   **IRNSS**: Indigenously developed navigation system having 7 satellites which will be used to provide accurate real-time positioning and timing services over **INDIA** and region extending to 1500 km around **INDIA**. **IRNSS** constellationwas named as **“NAVIC”** (Navigation with **INDIAN** Constellation) by **PM**.
    -   **NAVIC** provides two types of services: Standard Positioning Service (**SPS**) is meant for the general public. Restricted Service (**RS**) is an encrypted service meant for authorised users and agencies
    -   Advantages over **GPS**: **IRNSS** uses both L band & S band; Cost effective; Much more accurate (under 20m)

#### Advantages:

-   Precision: Each satellite has 3 atomic clock each to provide accurate measurements
-   Mapping and town planning
-   Integration with mobile phones
-   Security: eg: Tracking enemy movements across rough terrains, **US** denied access to **GPS** during **KARGIL WAR**
-   Terrestrial, Aerial, Marine Navigation
-   Disaster management to tackle forest fires, etc

#### Additional Information:

-   **INDIA** is planning to put up a new satellite series called the **INDIAN DATA RELAY SATELLITE SYSTEM (IDRSS)**. At present, in the absence of a data relay satellite system, spacecraft are not visible all the time. **IDRSS** is important to monitor launches in the **LEO** (needed for **GAGANYAAN**, future space station & other assets)

### India’s Space Vision & Current Challenges

-   Our space vision also needs to address global governance, regulatory and arms control issues. As space opens up our space vision needs broadening too. **INDIA** need visionary laws to meet **crimes done in space** and amend the **IPC** to include provision

#### Challenges:

-   As outer space becomes democratised, commercialised and crowded, the multilateral framework for its governance is becoming **obsolescent** (Quote **OUTER SPACE TREATY 1967**)
-   Space law **does not have a dispute settlement** mechanism, is **silent on** collisions and debris, and offers insufficient guidance on interference with others’ space assets
-   Legal framework is **state-centric**, placing responsibility on states **alone**. However, non-state entities are now in the fray for commercial space exploration and utilisation
-   Space is the highest ground. The **space arms race** is difficult to curb, especially since almost all space technologies have military applications (**UNGA** passed a resolution on **PREVENTION OF AN ARMS RACE IN OUTER SPACE** since 1982)
-   We are facing sustanability challenges on earth as well as in space. The future of space needs to be a guiding force for tackling issues here back on earth (rather than aggreveate it)

## INFORMATION & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES

### Meaning:

-   **ICT**: is the diverse set of tools used to create, transmit and store information.
-   Tools used include computers, internet, satellites, transmission medium (Guided = physical cables; Unguided uses air vaccuum)
-   In the overall electromagnetic spectrum, microwave and radio wave are used for communication purposes. Radio wave range is further divided into various bands such as L band, X band, Ku band, etc.
-   Digital signals are better than analog signals as digital ones are discrete, can travel large distance w/o loss of strength. Modem is used to convert digital into analog and vice versa

### Govt. Examples of using S&T

-   **PROJECT INSIGHT** of **INCOME TAX DEPT**. used big data analytics
-   **GI CLOUD** named **MEGHRAJ** launched by **MEITY**, **DIGI LOCKER**

-   Better and easy user interface etc

### 2015: Advantage and security implications of cloud hosting of servers vis-a-vis in-house machine-based hosting

-   **Cloud computing**: is all about storing and retrieving your data from your own little area on the Internet. The data is not stored here in your local hard drive

#### Advantage of cloud hosting over in–house machine:

-   Data can be accessed from any location, any device → leading to increased flexibility
-   Saving is capex → Rather the utility model of computing is followed which makes it a service
-   Regular backups can prevent data losses
-   Example- **AMAZON WEB SERVICES**
-   Govt- Cloud named **MEGHRAJ** launched by **MEITY**(for better egov services) , **DIGI LOCKER**
-   Elasticity- can scale up and down computing needs acc to demand - pay per use feature
-   Easy collab and sharing among multiple location

#### Advantage of in–house machine over cloud hosting

-   Get physical control over data; no third party has access to information
-   No need of Internet connection to access data
-   Data servers of cloud cos. are still prone to cyberattacks, disasters- no own hardware required

#### Security implication of cloud hosting

-   Data has to transmit via the internet which may make it vulnerable
-   Cos. may be linked to external state and non-state actors- neglects data privacy-
-   Vendor lock in- when want to migrate to another-very difficult
-   There is a need for proper encryption of data stored on cloud servers; Govt. must store critical data pertaining to national security over its local servers

### Digital Signature

2013: Digital signature: Features, Uses, Authetication, process

-   **A digital signature**: is a type of electronic signature which ensures that an electronic document is authentic
    -   Example- Passcord enabled bank statements, Game passkeys
    -   Benefits- save enviroment due to less paper

#### Used to:

-   Authenticate the identity of the sender using the public key of the sender
-   Data integrity: ensure that data has not been tampered after its creation
-   When a person wants to use digital signature, he has to obtain a **DIGITAL SIGNATURE CERTIFICATE (DSC)**. For this, he has to apply to a ‘**CERTIFYING AUTHORITY**’ which is the private professional agency authorised by the government under **IT ACT 2000** for this purpose. **CA** takes suitable verification about the applicant and then upon being satisfied, grants a digital signature certificate in the form of digital file to the applicant eg: of **CA** is **EMUDHRA**
-   **Digital signature certificates**: are the digital equivalent of paper certificates. They can be provided electronically for proving one's identity for accessing any online service or information.

#### Uses in India:

-   Compulsory for various assesses in **IT** filling, **GST**
-   Complying with legal requirements under **MCA**
-   Authentication of emails
-   Application for tenders
-   Applying at eprocurement websites of govt.

### 3D Printing Technology

2013: 3D printing technology: Advantages and disadvantages

-   **Additive manufacturing**: “making objects from 3D data, usually layer upon layer” - first designed in software then fed to computerised machines, which build that object layer by layer.
-   heralds a future in which value chains are **shorter, smaller, more localised, more collaborative,** and offer **significant sustainability benefits.**
-   A **PWC** report titled ‘**THE GLOBAL INDUSTRY 4.0**’ in 2016 shows that in **INDIA**, 27% of industries have either already invested or will be investing in **AM** technology within the next five years

#### Applications of 3D Printing

-   Defence- The **UK ROYAL AIR FORCE** and **NAVY** use **AM** for repairing spare parts.
-   Health- hearing aids,dental impants,organ printing through bio-printer, prosthetics
-   Architecture- recreate heritage (like tajmahal carving)
-   Food,industrial parts,etc

#### Advantages/ Benefits of 3D printing

6.  **Reduced wastage**: **AM** process produces less waste in comparison with other traditional manufacturing techniques

#### Disadvantages/ Issues with 3D Printing

1.  **Limited Raw Materials**: With 3D printing being an additive method (layer after layer), the materials available suited for it are limited- ceramics, resin, plastics, etc.
2.  **Effect on employment**: Jobs in manufacturing will be rendered obsolete which will have a negative impact on developing economies.
3.  **Concerns over copyright infringements**: There is concern over counterfeit printing of copyrighted or patented products.
4.  **Production of dangerous items**:International regimes such as the **NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS GROUP**, **MISSILE TECHNOLOGY CONTROL REGIME** and the **WASSENAAR AGREEMENT** that control technology have been concerned about the proliferation of high-performance 3-D printers, which have the capability to print parts for missile or nuclear weapon.
5.  **Cybersecurity concerns**: Studies have shown that the 3-D printer connected to the online network is vulnerable to cyber attacks.
6.  **Ethical concerns associated with use of 3D technology in healthcare**: concern about the development of personalised medicine is that it might increase cost of treatment and widen the disparity between rich and poor.

#### Way Forward

1.  There is a need for strong support from the government and business houses for **AM**-related studies and **R&D**.
2.  huge scope under the ‘**SKILL INDIA**’ initiative -reach out to the many technical institutes in the country to sensitise them
3.  The “**MAKE IT THE INDIAN WAY**” approach **needs public-private partnership** and multi-pronged efforts.- complement **MAKE IN INDIA**
4.  **International best practice-** **CHINA** had launched the first national plan for 3-D printing, called ‘**ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY PROMOTION PLAN 2015–2016**’.

### IT Sector: SWOT Analysis

#### Threats: Telangana loan apps blackmailing, Blue whale game,

### Artificial intelligence: Current scenario, prospects (Also read abt Mach learning, etc.)

-   It refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making and execute tasks in real time situations without constant supervision.
-   **AI**: is simulation of human intelligence by machines. **Machine learning** is a subset of **AI** (in **ML** where machines learn by experience and acquire skills w/o human intervention)
![GS3 Science Technology](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Science Technology 9.jpeg>)
-   Significance of **AI**: Propel social development, innovation and overcome limitations of current level of capital & labour
-   Particular applications of **AI** includes expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision without human involvement
-   Eg- **FACEBOOK**’s list of suggested friends for its users, a pop-up page, telling about an upcoming sale of the favourite brand of shoes and clothes.
-   Global Developments in **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)**: Many countries have instituted dedicated public offices such as the **MINISTRY OF AI (UAE)**, and **OFFICE OF AI AND AI COUNCIL (U.K.)**.

#### Uses of AI

-   **Healthcare**: **AI**-driven diagnostics, personalized treatment, early identification of potential pandemics, and imaging diagnostics.
-   **Agriculture**: Applied **AI** addresses challenges such as lack of assured irrigation, inadequate demand prediction, excess use of pesticides, fertilizers, and fungicides, prediction of crop prices, and real-time advisory.
    -   A Statement of Intent has been signed between **NITI AAYOG** and **IBM** to develop Precision Agriculture using **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)** in **ASPIRATIONAL DISTRICTS**.
-   **Transports, Logistics, and Smart Mobility**: monitoring and maintaining a predictive engine along with driver-assist (**TESLA**) , Other applications of **AI** include improved traffic management, autonomous trucking, and delivery.
-   **Retail**: image-based product searches, and preference-based browsing, customer demand anticipation, improved inventory management.
    -   **Manufacturing**: It can enable ‘**FACTORY OF THE FUTURE**’ through flexible and adaptable technical systems, smart logistics.
-   **Energy**: modeling and forecasting of the energy system to reduce unpredictability, smart meters to enable intelligent grids(help solar)
-   **Smart Cities**: Traffic control for reducing congestion enhanced security by providing improved crowd management
-   **Education and Skilling**: personalized learning, automating and expediting administrative tasks
    -   Starting this year, **the CBSE** has **AI** as an elective subject for its ninth grade classes
    -   **IIT HYDERABAD** has launched a full fledged **BACHELOR OF TECHNOLOGY (B TECH)** program in **AI**
    -   Proctored exams can be conducted where **AI** based software lock browsers and ensure no unfair means is used
-   Predictive Policing
    -   **predict the pattern of crime**, analyze lot of **CCTV** footage which are available across the country to identify suspects. **CCTNS** data use for **AI**.

#### Steps taken by India

-   **NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**- **NITI AAYOG** has identified five areas where **AI** can be useful. It has noted the lack of regulation around **AI** as a major weakness for **INDIA**.
    -   **NITI AAYOG**’s draft ‘Working Document: Enforcement Mechanisms for Responsible **AIFORALL**’,- suggests setting up oversight body for **AI**
    -   In 2018-19 budget, the government mandated **NITI AAYOG** to establish the **NATIONAL PROGRAM ON AI**
-   **CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (COE IN AI)** by **NATIONAL INFORMATICS CENTRE (NIC)** which is a platform for innovative new solutions in **AI** space.
-   **GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GPAI)**: Recently, **INDIA** joined **GPAI** as a founding member. (multi-stakeholder partnership to promote responsible and human centric development and use of **AI**, grounded in human rights, inclusion, diversity,eco growth)

#### Challenges

-   Concerns on privacy and security of data- **CAMBRIDGE ANALYITCA**- **FB** issue, deep fakes, criminal uses of facial recognition technology
-   The technological singularity is a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization (in simple terms machine intelligence > human intelligence)
-   **NITI AAYOG** highlighted that lack of regulation as a major weakness for **INDIA**
-   Difficulty in access to industry-specific data required to build customized platforms and solutions is now currently in the hands of a few major players (**FACEBOOK** or **GOOGLE**)- Technocracy fears
    -   Data colonialism
-   Biasness- in the process of self-learning, they can absorb and adopt the stereotypes that exist in society (garbage in garbage out)
    -   When **AI** used for Monitoring social media: During the live broadcast of chess matches, commentators speak/write like "‘Black's attack on White is brutal’ etc. But it gets flagged as hate speech and **YOUTUBE** accounts gets suspended as a result. Therefore human intervention is required to check the context of the words
-   Accountability: If an **AI** system fails at its assigned task, someone should be made responsible for it. e.g. an anti-terrorism facial recognition program revoked the driver’s license of an innocent man when it confused him for another driver.
-   Super-intelligence: Will it be good to human kind? - Movie “**HER**”, Robot and **AI** mixture
-   Defence- **AI** wars- make tradional defence platform impotent
-   Implementation challenges
    -   Lack of sufficient talent - only 4% of **AI** professionals in **INDIA** have worked on emerging technologies such as deep learning and neural networks. There is also a significant gap in **PH.D.** research scholars in the field.
    -   Funding,coordianation,awareness etc

#### Way Forward to Harness the Power of AI

-   Getting **INDIA** Ready for the **AI** Wave: **INDIA** may appear to be relatively well-positioned to take advantage of the disruption in the **AI** system through its advanced **IT** sector and large youth demographic potential- should be a national priority.
-   Accelerating Adoption: only 22% of the firms in **INDIA** use **AI** in any business process. Government intervention is needed to promote **AI** adoption, lest **INDIA** loses the chance to secure a prominent position on the global **AI** map.
-   Ethics, Privacy, Security, and Artificial Intelligence: needs to be conscious of the probable factors of the **AI** ecosystem that may undermine ethical conduct, impinge on one’s privacy, and undermine the security protocol.
    -   Needs to take care of human autonomy while making **AI** responsive, inclusive and sustainable
-   These challenges, if addressed by relevant stakeholders, with the government playing a leading role could lead to fundamental building blocks that form the core to **INDIA**’s march towards leadership in **AI** in an expeditious manner through concerted and collaborative efforts.
-   International agencies could be guided by the **ASILOMAR AI PRINCIPLES** (by **FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE**, a non-profit organization) which are 23 guidelines for the research and development of **AI**.

### Data Localisation: Need and challenges

#### Background:

-   Report of **JUSTICE BN SHRIKRISHNA COMMITTEE**
-   **RESERVE BANK OF INDIA** imposed a hard data localisation mandate to store payment systems data only in **INDIA**
-   Many countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing data localisation laws, including — **CHINA**, **UNITED STATES**, **BRAZIL**, **INDONESIA** and **RUSSIA**
-   **Data localization**: is the act of storing data on any device that is physically present within the borders of a specific country where the data was generated

#### Need for data localisation:

-   Economic development: Data is the new oil. Potential to create jobs in various fields; Cos. will also have to open data centres in **INDIA** which also fuel economic activity
-   Data privacy and data sovereignty
-   National security concerns: **DL** will help law enforcement agencies which currently has to get access from foreign agencies through **MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATIES (MLATS)** (**DL** can reduce jurisdictional issues)
-   Control monetization of **INDIAN** user’s data

#### Challenges:

-   Harm **INDIAN IT** sector: Cross country flow of data is the main raw material fueling are **IT** sector. **DL** may hamper its progress
-   There is no evidence that **DL** leads to better privacy
-   Access issues might still remain as data may be stored in encrypted form
-   Hamper bilateral relation: Countries such as **USA** may see it as protectionism
-   Lack of data protection laws and strong cyber security framework poses threats for localised data
-   Balkanization of internet (called fractured internet) where the domino effect of protectionist policy can lead to other countries following suit
-   We need to focus more on data access as that is the ultimate goal of **DL**.

### 5G

-   **5G**: is a next generation mobile network technology after 4G **LTE** networks.
-   Provide seamless coverage, high data rate, ultra-low latency and as a result highly reliable communications.

#### Advantages of 5G

-   High speed use cases: high quality streaming, faster storage and access of cloud by businesses, better communication
    -   To download a 2 hour film: 4G would take 6 minutes where as 5G will take 3.6 seconds
-   Ultra-low latency: Latency refers to the time it takes for one device to send a packet of data to another device. In 4G the latency rate is around 50 milliseconds but 5G will reduce that to about 1 millisecond.
-   Massive **INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT)**: Smart City Infrastructure and Traffic Management, Industrial Automation, Wearables and Mobile devices, Precision agriculture etc.
-   Various fields:
    -   In agriculture- precision farming, smart irrigation, improved soil and crop monitoring, to livestock management.
    -   In manufacturing, use of robotics for precision manufacturing, particularly where humans cannot perform these functions safely or accurately. Eg **BANDICOOT** Robot
    -   In the energy sector, ‘smart grids’ and ‘smart metering’.
    -   In health-care- tele-medicine delivery, tele-control of surgical robotics and wireless monitoring of vital statistics (this can be possible through Network slicing where mobile operators to create multiple virtual networks within a single physical 5G network)

#### Challenges

-   Huge Investment Required: **INDIA** needs a massive **RS 5 LAKH CRORE ($70 BILLION)** investment to bring in **5G**.(change statistics)
    -   This is because when we switch to higher frequency the interference increases. Thus to reduce interference we need more number of smaller tower
-   Expensive spectrum: **INDIAN** spectrum prices are some of the highest in the world, while 40% of the spectrum is lying unsold
    -   Debt scenario in the industry: According to **ICRA**- **RS 4.2 LAKH CRORE**.
-   Lack of uniform policy framework: Delays due to complex procedures across states impacted telecom service providers in rolling-out **OPTICAL FIBRE CABLES (OFC)** and telecom towers
-   Low optical fibre penetration: **BHARAT NET** - increase speed [Can also be written that we lack backhaul capacity]
-   High Import of Equipment’s: Imports account for a 90 per cent of **INDIA**’s telecom equipment market.- **HUAWAI** issue
-   Inter-operability: Devices working on old tech need to switch over to newer tech
-   Rumours from 5G radiation ~ reluctance among people
-   Security- **US** designated **HUAWAI** as national security threat

#### Measure Taken

-   **5G HIGH LEVEL FORUM 2017** to articulate vision for **5G**
-   Govt has launched ‘**5G TEST BED**’
-   **BHARAT NET PROJECT** to promote adoption of optical fibers

#### Way forward:

-   **Spectrum Policy**: **INDIA**’s spectrum allocation for public wireless services should be enhanced significantly. Also, the cost of spectrum relative to per capita **GDP** is high and should come down.
    -   **Policy-**makers may consider the use of shared spectrum to promote efficiency
-   **Create a Fifth Generation (5G) Program** Office within **DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS** and an Oversight Committee.
-   **New civil infrastructure like** gas, electricity, water lines should be mandated to provide **COMMON TELECOM INFRASTRUCTURE** resources such as ducting and power junction boxes to support **5G** infrastructure.
-   **Privacy**- strong data protection policy and law
-   **Security audits**, a prerequisite for importing of equipment before deploying in **INDIAN** networks
-   **Fifth Generation (5G) Pilot**: encouraging **5G** pilots and test beds to test **5G** technologies
-   Support **Fifth Generation (5G)** investment
    -   Proirtise domestic investment- eg **JIO** plans for **5G** as well as prevent monopoly in market

## NANOTECHNOLOGY

### Basics

-   **Why NT**: Conversion of material at nano scale shows remarkable & distinct properties which are not observed at larger scale (Properties can be optical, physical, chemical, etc.)
-   eg: Gold at macro is yellow but at nano scale turn red/purple (with a confined motion of electrons); Nano-gold is used to treat cancer
-   Works on the concept of Quantum (i.e small) mechanics.
-   Science of extremely small → b/w 1 nm to 100 nm (1nm = 1 billionth of meter)
-   Nobel Laureate physicist **RICHARD FEYAMAN** - considered Father of Nanotechnology
![GS3 Science Technology](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Science Technology 12.jpeg>)
