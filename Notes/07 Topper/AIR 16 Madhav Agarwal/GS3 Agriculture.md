## PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM- OBJECTIVES, FUNCTIONING, LIMITATIONS, REVAMPING
- The PDS in the country facilitates the supply of food grains and distribution of essential commodities to a large number of poor people through a network of Fair Price Shops at a subsidized price on a recurring basis.
- **Entitlement as per NFSA 2013**: Under PDS, every individual is entitled to 5 kilogram of subsidised wheat **or** rice every month, with a cap of 30 kg per household. The ANTYODAYA (~25 million families) are entitled to 35 kg along with a kg of sugar.
- **Objectives** (make diagram using them)
    - Ensuring Food and Nutritional Security
    - Stabilising food prices and making food available to the poor at affordable prices
    - Maintains the buffer stock of food grains
    - Redistribution of grains from surplus regions to deficient regions
- **Evolution of PDS**
    - ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 1.png]]
- **Functioning**
    - PDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the CENTRAL and the STATE GOVERNMENTS.
        - The CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, through FOOD CORPORATION OF INDIA (FCI), has assumed the responsibility for procurement, storage, transportation and bulk allocation of food grains to the STATE GOVERNMENTS.
        - The operational responsibilities including allocation within the State, identification of eligible families, issue of Ration Cards and supervision of the functioning of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) etc., rest with the STATE GOVERNMENTS. There are ~5.4 lakh fair price shops.
    - ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 4.jpeg]]
    - Presently the commodities namely wheat, rice, sugar and kerosene are being allocated. Some States/UNION TERRITORIES also distribute additional items such as pulses, edible oils, iodized salt, spices, etc.
    - **Successes**: From 2004-05 to 2011-12, the number of Indian households reported buying food grains from fair price shops doubled; Food security.
- **Limitations of PDS wrt various levels**
    - **Procurement**:
        - Open ended procurement → shortage in the market → inflation
        - MSP has distorted crop diversity (❤ towards rice/wheat)
        - ECONOMIC SURVEY 2021 highlighted while CIP is same since 2013 but MSP have increased substantially → Fiscal burden (even the NFSA envisaged price revision after 3 yrs)
    - **Storage & transportation**:
        - Leakage and black marketing: Erstwhile Planning Commission found 36% leakage of PDS rice and wheat at the all-India level
        - Cover issues with FCI in document below
    - **Distribution of foodgrains**:
        - Over 10 crore people have been excluded from the PDS because outdated 2011 census data is being used to calculate NFSA coverage
        - Residential basis of issues of grains → Excluded migrants
        - Urban bias → remote area not given adequate importance
        - Lack of transparent process to port the names of migrated indv or adding news names (newly wed women along with children are thus unable to access their share of ration)
- **Measure taken**
    - Digitisation of 234 million ration card database across States/ UNION TERRITORIES (100% completed - NITI AAYOG Report)
    - BAPU MODEL (Biometrically Authenticated Physical Uptake); AADHAAR seeding of ration cards, thereby enabling BAPU (90% completed)
    - Automation of FPS and installation of electronic-POS machines (90% completed)
    - NFSA: Moved from welfare to a rights-based approach; Recognised women’s central role to food security by issuing cards in her name
    - **ONE NATION ONE RATION CARD**: Buy 50% food grains from any FPS across the country using existing card which is AADHAAR linked (major benefit to migrants)
        - **Challenges**: Technological issues (AADHAAR, E-POS linkages), No data on migration, Local food habits may be disincentivized (as migrants may not get home state local allocations)
    - Online grievance redressal systems, toll-free helplines, SMS based alerts during dispatch and arrival of TPDS commodities, JAM TRINITY
    - **State wise reforms**
        - Door step delivery of ration as started by Delhi, Andhra Pradesh
        - UNION TERRITORIES such as Chandigarh, Puducherry having shifted to DBT (rather than grain distribution)
        - GPS technology to track PDS trucks in Chattisgarh, Tamil Nadu
- ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 5.jpeg]]
- **Alternatives to TPDS**
- **Need for further Revamping**
    - Achieve 100% AADHAAR linkage and 100% E-POS devices to make ONE NATION, ONE RATION CARD a reality
    - A ‘give-up option’ on lines of cooking gas cylinder can be made available 
    - or link issue price to at least half of the procurement price and move gradually towards cash transfers
    - Barring the needy, other beneficiaries can be made subject to higher slab rates in PDS (rather than current system of flat rates for all)
    - Bio-fortified foods need to be distributed through the PDS
    - Private sector should be encouraged/leveraged (for eg: they can be used in storage of grains thus reducing pressure from FCI)
    - A transparent liquidation policy should automatically kick-in when FCI is faced with surplus stocks than buffer norms
    - FPS should be operated through Gram Panchayats, Cooperatives, Self Help Groups
    - SHANTA KUMAR COMMITTEE: Cash transfer to 1mn+ cities; Bring down coverage of NFSA from 67% to 40%
    - 💡 - JYOTI KAKWANI plugs pilferage in fair price shops by giving surprise gifts to those who demand weight receipts from the shopkeeper by conducting lucky draws (Odisha)

#### 2019: What are the reformative steps taken by the Government to make food grain distribution system more effective? Other reforms required?
- _Covered above_

## ISSUES OF BUFFER STOCKS
- The Buffer norms are the minimum food grains that Centre should have in the _Central pool_ at the beginning of each quarter to meet requirement of PDS and other govt. schemes/strategic reserves. FCI is the nodal agency for the same. It was introduced in 4th FYP. Other agencies which maintain buffer stock are NAFED (eg: for pulses), State agencies.
- **Objectives** of maintaining buffer stock: _Same as PDS_
- **Issues and challenges**:
    - (excess stock means excess procurement and slow distribution - therefore first 3 points highlight procurement prob and then disbursal and storage issues)
    - ‘Mountains of grain’: Open ended procurement → shortage in the market → inflation → Excess stock with FCI (July 2020: FCI will have “excess stocks” of at least 50 million mt)
        - 💡: With approx cost of 30,000/tonne, this amounts to Rs 1,50,000 crore unproductive locked-up capital
    - MSP has distorted crop diversity (❤ towards rice wheat)
    - ECONOMIC SURVEY 2021 highlighted while CIP is same since 2013 but MSP have increased substantially → Fiscal burden
    - No automatic liquidation rule: Ideally, FCI should sell all grains above buffer stocks in open markets. But there is no such rule and offtake happen only on the directive of the ministry
    - Cover issues with FCI here [[Issues in storage: GS-3 Agriculture](https://quip.com/pKd4AG5ebd0u#cNGACAwcfeQ)]
        - Maintained as outdoor stacks (‘Cover-and-Plinth’ system), which face high risk of rain damage and pilferage
    - Marginalization of private trade (De-facto nationalization of the grain market: With more than 75% of the marketable surplus procured by the government)
    - Lack of coordination between FCI and Consumer Ministry which decides buffer norms
- **Conclusion**
    - Buffer stocks being integral part of food security needs reforms to make it both practical and viable for government as well as beneficial to consumers and farmers. SHANTA KUMAR and ASHOK DALWAI COMMITTEE recommendations like FCI reforms, technological upgradation, using metal containers (reduce wastage) etc., needs to be implemented.

## FOOD SECURITY
- **Statistics** - as per STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD (SOFI) REPORT 2020 (by FAO + others)
    - India retains the dubious distinction of being the country with the largest population of food insecure people
    - Prevalence of food insecurity increased by 3.8% points in India between 2014 and 2019
- **4 Factors affecting FS are**: **Availability** (whether domestic or imported), **Access** (purchasing power, access to govt programs), **Utilization** (despite india being world’s largest producers of milk/pulses, its lacking on utilization) and **Vulnerability** (vulnerability to shocks and disasters)
    - _Note: The issues wrt FS can also be anlayses using these as sub-headings, apart from these cover issues wrt to Hunger topic from Social Justice_
- **Provision under Constitution**:
    - Right to food and other basic necessities part of ARTICLE 21 (_PEOPLE'S UNION FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES/PUCL VS UNION OF INDIA 2001_)
    - DPSP - Raising the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people ARTICLE 47
- Need to focus on qualitative FS (nutrition) rather than quantitative FS (six-fold increase in food grain production from 50 million tonnes in 1950- 51 to more than 292 million tonnes in 2019-20)
    - India has addressed the issue of food access to a large extent, however, undernourishment remains a challenge, **indicated by** the high prevalence of stunting and wasting amongst children under the age of five. Such undernourishment is on **account of complex interactions** of several factors like sanitation, genetics, environment and food intake
- **Scheme to ensure FS**
    - INTEGRATED CHILD DEVELOPMENT SCHEME: Basic needs for children upto 6 year, pregnant and lactating mothers; Take home rations, immunization, check ups
    - The ANGANWADI SERVICES scheme provides a package of six services including supplementary nutrition, pre-school non-formal education, nutrition and health education, immunization, health and referral services. These services operate through ~1.38 million ANGANWADI CENTRES, benefitting children under six years of age and pregnant women & lactating mothers
    - MID DAY MEAL SCHEME - twin pillars of improving nutrition and education related outcomes
    - NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY ACT, 2013, PDS related measures taken
    - POSHAN ABHIYAAN 2017 (NATIONAL NUTRITION MISSION): which is a multi-ministerial convergence mission aims to mount a concerted attack on stunting, under-nutrition, anaemia and low birth weight by 2, 2, 3 and 2 per cent per annum, respectively, over a three-year timeframe (NITI Vice-Chairman is the head of POSHAN ABHIYAAN’S NATIONAL COUNCIL)
- **Concern at WTO**
    - Under WTO’s AGREEMENT ON AGRICULTURE (AOA), Developed (1st world) and Developing (3rd world) countries are required to limit their food-subsidies to 5% and 10% respectively to the value of their agriculture production at 1986 level (general notion is that food subsidies are seen as trade distorting)
    - 2013: PEACE CLAUSE brought at Bali conference which allowed temporary immunity to India and other developing countries and protect their food procurement programmes against action from WTO members in case subsidy ceilings are breached (when 10% or greater)
        - During pandemic, India invoked peace clause (making it first country to take recourse to such regard)
    - 2017: BUENOS AIRES SUMMIT - talks remained inconclusive and in effect peace clause extended for infinite period
        - Stand of India: Wants a permanent solution to the issue; AoA uses 1986 level which is arbitrary and do not reflect current conditions
        - Stand of G-33 nations: Include food subsidy in green box
        - Stand of EU, USA, CANADA: Do not incl in green box as trade distorting
- **Conclusion**:
    - With climate change looming large on the horizon, a fundamental measure to sustain food security is climate-smart agriculture
    - SDG 2 - End hunger, achieve **food security**, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture

#### 2013: Food Security Bill? Apprehension in its implementation and concerns at WTO
- Food Security Bill has following provisions:
    - It entitles 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population (67% of the population i.e. 80 crore people) for subsidized grain under TPDS
    - Shift from welfare to right based approach; Legal right got established
    - Use DBT if State / UNION TERRITORY doesn’t want the administrative burden of providing grains in PDS shop
    - For women empowerment: The eldest woman in the household = head of household for ration card
    - Maternity benefits of min. ₹ 6,000, in instalments; "Take home ration" of 600 Calories
    - Approximate Budget allocation: >Rs. 1.5 lakh crore
- **Apprehensions in implementation**:
    - Cover limitation of PDS [[Limitations of PDS wrt various levels: GS-3 Agriculture](https://quip.com/pKd4AG5ebd0u#cNGACAixZZl)]
- **Issues at WTO**: _Covered above_

## ISSUES RELATED TO MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICES
- **MSP** is a **form of market intervention by the GOVERNMENT OF INDIA** to insure agricultural producers against any sharp fall in farm prices during bumper production years. The major objectives are to support the farmers from distress sales and to procure food grains for public distribution. (MSP system evolved in 1975-76)
- The MSPs are announced/approved by the UNION GOVERNMENT (CC of EA) at the beginning of the sowing season for certain crops on the basis of the recommendations of the COMMISSION FOR AGRICULTURAL COSTS AND PRICES (CACP).
- MSP announced for 23 crops [7 cereals, 7 oilseeds, 5 pulses, 4 commercial crops - cotton, jute, Sugarcane, copra]
- Procurement by FCI, NAFED- open ended- (sab le lenge, capital block krenge, then loss mein liquidate kr denge)
- **Need**- (NABARD)’s’ ALL INDIA RURAL FINANCIAL INCLUSION SURVEY 2016-17 found that the average monthly income of an agriculture household is less Rs.9,000/- from all sources combined (cultivation, wage labour, animal husbandry). Farmer rarely has has surplus savings/lack of credit/ for buying inputs for the next cropping season, MSP can help prevent this.
- **Importance**: (use basic 4 objectives of PDS)
    - **Fixed Remunerations**: The farmers are financially secured against the vagaries of price instability in the market. During depressed prices govt comes for rescue.
    - **Social Security**: The fixed prices for different crops saves farmers from distress selling. This in turn helps them to get out of the clutches of money lenders and middlemen.
    - **Diversification of crops**: The MSP announced by the Government of India for the first time in 1966-67 for wheat has been extended to around 23 crops at the present. This will encourage the farmers to grow these diverse crops to maximize their income.
    - Supports food security programme through PDS procurement by FCI.
    - Nudge farmers to sow particular crop in short supply by govt- gives direction to market (eg can be used for millets promotion).
    - Acts as an benchmark for agro-commodity market- While it doesn’t guarantee that market prices will also be higher than MSP, but atleast it ensures the market prices will not drastically lower than MSP.
- **Govt initatives**
    - MSP will be 1.5 times of A2+FL cost (A2- actual cost on inputs, FL- imputed cost of unpaid family labour), not SWAMINATHAN recomm of including C2 (imputed rent on land and imputed interest on capital)
    - PM AASHA
        - PSS- procurement of pulses and oilseeds
        - Price deficiency- diff of MSP and actual selling- reimburse by govt on lines of BHAVANTAR BHUGTAN YOJANA of Madhya Pradesh
        - Pvt procurement- hire pvt agencies for MSP procurement
- **Issues**
    - Procurement confined to rice and wheat- Deterrent to crop diversification, promoting water intensive crops (rice, sugarcane)
    - Economic Surveys have observed that MSP procurement is not uniform across all states, a significant portion of pulses & oilseeds were sold below the MSP
    - Implementation isssues- huge waiting at procurement centre- leads to distress sale
    - As per a report submitted by the government-appointed committee on restructuring food crop in India, only 6 percent of total farmers in the country can sell their crops at MSP
    - SHANTA KUMAR COMMITTEE report and the CACP reports had suggested **reducing** procurement and an **end to** open-ended procurement from states like Punjab to cut down costs of FCI
    - FCI-Buffer stock - shortage in rice/wheat market- promote inflation (high inflation reduces consumptive capacity of consumers)
    - Low quality issue in PDS
- **Way forward**
    - MSP tha, hai aur rahega so need reforms in MSP to plug PDS leakages while using it for promoting crop diversification
    - Reforming the MSP system is need of the hour to ensure farmers income are doubled by 2022
    - **Demand for legal backing**
        - It is feared that FCI itself may start procuring directly from the new trade area to cut down buying costs like market fees and arhtiya commission
        - The demand for legal backing to MSP also arises from the fact that the government has been announcing MSP for 23 crops, but procurement is limited to a few crops
        - SHANTA KUMAR COMMITTEE (2015) said only 6% of farm households sell wheat and rice to govt at MSP
        - Also, CACP in one of its reports in 2017-18 (kharif) suggested that “to instil confidence among farmers for procurement of their produce, a legislation conferring on farmers ‘the right to sell at MSP’ may be brought out.”
        - Similarly, in Maharashtra law was made to penalise traders who bought below MSP → when prices fell below MSP, the traders withdrew and farmers suffered
    - **Issues in legal backing**
        - Punjab’s amendments to farm Acts
            - Making MSP mandatory for wheat and paddy are ill-advised as this law will discourage private buyers from buying → this will lead to excess supply → Govt does not have resources to absorb everything → Market failure
            - Economic theory as well as experience indicate the price level that is not supported by demands and supply cannot be sustained through legal means (NITI AAYOG’s Paper) eg: Sugar sector, pvt mills need to buy canes at FRP but when supply is more, mill fail to make payments leading to accumulation of dues
            - By creating stringent rules (fine or imprisonment), the government may create a situation where farmers would not be able to sell at all
        - It is difficult to enforce such a law as private agricultural markets cannot be run through such diktats
        - Maharashtra attempted this legality in 2018 in its APMC Act but had to reverse it after protests by traders

#### 2018: MSP? Importance? Objectives? How will it rescue farmers from low income trap? Is legal status feasible?
- Covered above

## ISSUES RELATED TO DIRECT AND INDIRECT FARM SUBSIDIES
- **Subsidies**- form of **financial or in-kind support** extended to individual, institution or buisiness to promote economic growth along with socio-economic welfare
- **Types of Subsidies**
    - **Direct**- monetary benefit directly to beneficiary eg DBT, PM-KISAN scheme, Odisha KALIYA scheme
    - **Indirect**- subsidies in form of inputs, cheaper credit, investment in agri R&D etc (irrigation, power by state, fertilizer, food, fuel by union)
        - **Food subsidy** (NFSA 2013) or MSP support
            - **Issues**- ghost benefiaries, cereal centric, huge corruption, diversion for rice exports, neglect of pulses and oilseeds leading to huge import
            - **Solutions**- Realistic MSP’s, storage capacity, DBT-AADHAAR, promote crop diversification
        - **Fertilizer subsidy**
            - **Issues**-Heavy fiscal burden- 70,000 cr, Indiscriminate use- 8:3:1 instead of ideal 4:2:1, rich farmers taking most benefit, soil degradation, eutrophication, negelct organic farming, smuggled to neighbouring countries
            - Urea is regulated separately and other are separate (refer prelims notes if reqd)
            - **Solutions**- SHC, neam coated urea, ZBNF, Nutrient-based subsidy, Centre is **_working_** on a plan to cap the number of subsidised fertiliser bags that individual farmers can buy in any cropping season; World's first NANO UREA LIQUID by IFFCO; Extend NBS model to Urea as well so that its price; Work towards reduction in imports (become ATMA NIRBHAR in fertilizers); Alternate bio-fertilisers must be promoted
            - Mobile based Fertilizer management system (end to end info on F movement to control leakage- subsidy to co. only when bought from retailer)
        - **Fuel subsidy** (Kerosene subsidy (used for lighting homes, cooking, LPG Subsidy))
            - **Issues**
                - Kerosene- blackmarketing, diverted to other uses
                - LPG- benefits higher income groups
            - **Solutions**
                - Kerosene- restrict to only BPL, solar lights
                - LPG- PAHAL scheme, DBT, Give it up for rich
        - **Power subsidy, Irrigation subsidy**
            - **Issues**
                - Excessive ground water use for agri, pollution
                - Cultivation of water intesive crops at cost of others- neglect millets
            - **Solutions**
                - Sep agri feeder under DDUGJY- supply only for specified hours
                - Showed result in Gujarat
                - PANI BACHAO, PAISA KAMAO SCHEME by Punjab
- **Other kinds of indirect subsidies**- loan waivers, seed (HVY), credit subsidies (interest subventions, fasal bima, Loan waivers) infra (irrigation schemes, ELECTRONIC NEGOTIABLE WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS, etc)
- **Other issues with indirect subsidies**
    - Take money away from productive capital expenditure in agri (of the total public expenditure going to agriculture, higher portion is going to input subsidies and lower portion is going for GFCF in agriculture)
- **Way Fwd**
    - Need to incentivize farmers away from water-thirsty crops like rice and towards more **value-added crops**, fruits and vegetables (as they can be used for agro-processing)
    - Switch from farm subsidy to farm investment by increasing portion of capex in agriculture

#### 2017: How do subsidies affect the cropping pattern, crop diversity and economy of farmers? (what are the other distortions created by it) What is the significance of crop insurance, minimum support price and food processing for small and marginal farmers?
- There are various subsidies available to farmers in terms of cheap input credit, seeds and fertilizers, subsidized electricity and irrigation etc. Agriculture subsidies always have some impact on various activities of agriculture.
- **Cropping pattern**: Crop selection gets distorted in favour of those crops which have high share of subsidies or attract large volume of subsidies. For example cheap electricity and irrigation subsidies motivated Punjab farmers to go for water guzzling crops like rice, moreover there has been increase in cropping intensity.
- **Crop diversity**: Crop diversity gives way to the standard staple crops where there is assured market and cost of production is low due to subsidies. For example wheat and rice are the standard crops in present times for Rabi and Kharif season respectively.
- **Economy of farmers**: Various subsidies ensure income support to farmers and safe stock of food grains. But at the same time it leads to distorted production patterns, resulting in food inflation.
- **Significance of various factors on small and marginal farmers**
    - **Crop insurance**: It provides income security in case of crop failure due to natural and other reasons. It also gives them cushion against their investment in agricultural activities.
    - **Minimum Support Price**: Minimum prices ensure a minimum guaranteed income for the crops thereby hedging them from market fluctuations. Guarantee of a buyer while cultivation of crops gives a sense of financial security to the farmer.
        - Though high MSP for certain produces such as wheat and rice drives farmers to take the "safe side" and thus shifts to cereal production rather than fruits, vegetables etc.
    - **Food processing**: Through value addition it ensures not only better income but long shelf life for the agro products. For the country like India where the wastage is high and over 80% of farmers are small and marginal with limited capacity, their income base can be enhanced through food processing.

#### 2015: Replacement of price subsidy with DIRECT BENEFIT TRANSFER (DBT)? Pros and Cons
- Write about demerits of Indirect subsidies (all types) in brief
- Examples of govt using DBT already - scholarship, PM-KISAN, MGNREGA, LPG etc

## LAND REFORMS
- **What?**
    - LR is changing of laws, regulations, customs regarding land ownership to build an egalitarian social order
    - ARTICLE 39 DPSP- resource of the country should be ditributed to serve the common good
    - Acc to Nobel prize winner GUNNAR MYRDAL- land reforms should take precedence over technological reforms
- **Need/Objectives**
    - **Economic**
        - Absentee land ownership- lack of investement in land- underdevelped agri
            - LR will lead to agri growth
    - **Social**
        - Exploitation of tenants - high rents and insecurity of tenure by Z (called parasitic class)
        - Social inequlity- lower caste as tenant
            - LR will ensure socio-eco justice
        - Poverty eradication
    - **Political**
        - British collusion- got very powerful
            - LR - political equality
- **LR post indpendence**
- **Aspects of LR**- ZA, LC, TR, LC, LM
- **Zamindari Abolition** (first logical step of LR)
    - Z- intermediary between tiller and govt
    - 1st CAA,1951 - introduced **Ninth schedule** to save state laws abolishing zamindari (as land - state subject)
        - **Benefits**
            - Around 1700 lakh hectares- acquired
            - Many Z- started cultivation- improvement in agri through HVY etc
            - Bonded labour declined
        - **Limitations**
            - Absence of land record hampered Z abolition
            - Delay due to excessive court cases, use of loopholes -turned tenant themselves
            - New Zamindars formed- as tenant leased same land to other inferior tenant (one layer gone, new layer emerged)
- **Land Ceiling**
    - i.e capping the size of land that can be held by individual/family (recommeded in 1949, most states enacted ceiling laws by 1961)
    - surplus land can be distributed by states (diff ceilings) to tenants/coop farming
    - Most weakly implemented aspect of land reforms
        - **Benefits**
            - Reducef fallow land- more agri
            - By 1985- more than 40 lakh hectares land redistributed above ceiling
            - More employement
        - **Limitations**
            - Loopholes- register under family names- Benami property
            - Initially ceiling imposed on individuals and not family
            - Inaccesibilty of credit to tenant even after getting land
            - Promoted land fragmentation - threat to land consolidation
            - Couples divorced each other and transf property in name of spouse - yet lived together - to escape LC
- **Tenancy Reforms**
    - Measures through legislation to protect rights of tenants to prevent forceful eviction, fixing rents by govt
    - Insecurity of tenant- prevent him to invest in agri, soil improvememt
        - **Benefits**
            - Most states fixed rent 25-35% to given by tenant
            - Even most states provide for right to ownership on fulfillement of certain conditions like cultivating land for specified number of years (Later NITI land leasing policy- provision for protecting land- HAHA)
        - **Obstacles**
            - Rent as high as 50% have to be paid
            - Oral agreements, muscle power - harrasment of tenant
            - Only legally aware tenant benefited
            - Absence of land record
        - OPERATION BARGA by West Bengal to protect rights of bargardars (sharecroppers)
- **Land Consolidation**
    - i.e pooling and reallocating farmer land- farmer **gets new farm** equal to earlier farm
        - **Benefits**
            - Large farms- more modernisation, scientific farming, economies of scale, better credit, more bargaining power in case of contract farming (same benefits of cooperative farming)
        - **Obstacles**
            - Ancestral land- diff to depart with
            - Hesitance of small F- may get inferior-non fertile land
            - Great subjectivity in price determination
            - Inefficient revenue/village implementing officials
- **Voluntary initative for LR**
    - BHOODAN/GRAMDAN by VINOBA BHAVE- volutary appeal to give lands (one sixth)
        - GRAMDAN- village with no private owner-cooperative farming
        - Faded away in 1967
- **Other initiatives**
    - NATIONAL LAND RECORD MODERNISATION (later called DIGITAL INDIA LRM PROG)
        - Better handling/maintenance/registration for predictable and efficient land policies to suit need of admin, agri, industry
    - FOREST RIGHTS ACT 2006- Ind and community rights to tribals
    - DRAFT NATIONAL LR POLICY 2013
        - Creation of land pool of unused land and give to landless for agri
        - Protection of land belonging to SC/ST, give land in name of woman, power to gram sabha under PESA
        - Land protection fund- to prevent distress sale by weaker sections
        - Laws on lines of Bihar land disputes act 2009 for common and easy procedure fro dispute resolution
- **Current Status**:
    - After 1991 LPG, land reforms on backseat to promote industry
        - India is facing a problem of fragmented landholdings at present, with nearly 67% of Indian farmers possessing land holdings below 1 hectare. Appropriate reforms in this case would be cooperative farming to ensure viability, land banks etc.
        - Current issues with pvt sector in agri - new bills
        - Need for contract farming
        - Land leasing law by NITI AAYOG- promtes interests of land owner plus tenant, even for construction, industry growth
    - A parliamentary panel has recommended to set up an empowered committee of state and central ministers to discuss issues related to land acquisition and build a consensus on land reforms in consultation with stakeholders.

#### 2016: Discuss the role of land reforms in agricultural development. Identify the factors that were responsible for the success of land reforms in India.
- LR helped GREEN REVOLUTION by bringinf more land into agri - ensured food security through HYV, better irrigation, credit
- Write benefist of 4 elements of LR helping agriculture
- **Factors that led to success of land reforms**:
    1.  Political will to insert the 9th schedule in the constitution and abolish the right to property.
    2.  Land being a state subject, these land reforms were particularly successful in states of Kerala and West Bengal, which had communist governments for several decades.
    3.  Increasing literacy and awareness regarding land rights and constitutional provisions.
    4.  Advent of various NGOs and cooperatives that helped farmers reap the benefits of such laws.
    5.  High yield variety (HYV) seeds, inorganic fertilizers and subsidies on diesel and electricity that increased productivity manifold during GREEN REVOLUTION.
- Land reforms are an ongoing process, and the post-independence reforms helped several landless farmers get their fair share of landholdings. It is imperative that newer reforms such as proper crop rotation, organic farming and sustainable agriculture be promoted now, in view of the present scenario.

#### 2014: RFCTLARR ACT 2013: Key issues addressed by it? Implications on industrialization and agriculture?
- **Land Acquisition**
    - LA ACT 1894- British law replaced by RIGHT TO FAIR COMPENSATION AND TRANSPARENCY IN LAND ACQUISTION, REHABILITATION AND RESETTLEMENT ACT 2013
    - **Main features of act**:
        - Clearly defines various types of “public purpose” projects for which, Government can acquire private land.
        - Acquiring land: For private project, 80% affected families must agree. For PPP project, 70% affected families must agree.
        - Social impact assessment: Under SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (SIA) even need to obtain consent of the affected artisans, labourers, share-croppers, tenant farmers etc whose (sustainable) livelihood will be affected because of the given project.
        - Compensation: 4 times the market rate in rural area. 2 times in urban area. Affected artisans, small traders, fishermen etc. will be given one-time payment, even if they don’t own any land.
        - To ensure food security: Fertile, irrigated, multi-cropped farmland can be acquired only in last resort. If such fertile land is acquired, then Government will have to develop equal size of wasteland for agriculture purpose.
        - Private entities: If Government acquires the lands for private company- the said private company will be responsible for relief and rehabilitation of the affected people.
        - Safeguards: Establishment of LAND ACQUISITION, REHABILITATION AND RESETTLEMENT AUTHORITY for speedy disposal of disputes.
        - Accountability: If project doesn’t start in 5 years, land has to be returned to the original owner or the land bank.
        - Exceptions: Act provisions not apply to 16 legislations- eg NATIONAL HIGHWAY ACT, SEZ act, Atomic energy, Railway, LA (mines) etc.
- **Implication on Industrialisation and Agriculture** (cover +ves points as well)
    - **Industry**
        - Requirement of SIA - delay in imp of industrail projects, many stalled
        - Compensation price determination issue, too many people affected so chances of court cases even after payment- farmers not agreeing with compensation
    - **Agriculture**
        - LA of agri land at last resort
        - Cultivate other land by state in case of LA- protects food security
    - **Other criticism**- public purpose very wide
- The RIGHT TO FAIR COMPENSATION AND TRANSPARENCY IN LA, R AND R 2015 (central ordinace lapsed)- diff state diff LA while central law is 2013 one
    - Creates 5 special categories- defence, rural infra, affordable housing, industrial corridors, infra project including PPP- no consent required
    - Many states brought changes acc to this new law in their own act
- **Issues**:
    - States amended the act by way of ordinances to exempt broad categories of land projects from consent provisions, social impact assessment, objections by affected citizens and participation of local bodies. Projects exempted are linear category projects such as industrial corridors, expressways, highways etc.

#### 2013: Establish relationship between land reforms, agricultural productivity and elimination of poverty in the Indian economy. Discuss the difficulties in designing and implementation of agriculture – friendly land reforms in India?
- Write benefits of all 4 elements of LR and connect with agri and elimination of poverty of rural landless and other beneftting from it.
- **Difficulties in designing ion agri friendly reform**:
    - Write about challanges of all 4 elements
    - Other current issues- Too much LR- smaller land holdings (esp in Bengal)- need for L consolidation too
    - Diff states- diff success of LR
    - Need for modern mechanised agri-coopeartive farming, land pooling

#### Land Reforms: Issues, Failures, Success? Role of UNION GOVERNMENT? Types of measures taken? Reforms needed?
- (Land reform measures were initiated to achieve the twin objective of increasing agricultural production and attainment of social justice)

## FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES
### Syllabus: Food processing and related industries in India- scope and significance, location, upstream and downstream requirements, supply chain management
- **Introduction**:
    - Food processing is the transformation of raw agricultural produce into food through chemical and mechanical processes. FP is the link b/w agriculture and industry.
    - FPI is identified as ‘sunrise’ industry - Out of the country’s total agriculture and food produce, only 10 per cent is processed (compared to Indonesia, Malaysia 70-80%) → shows huge scope/potential.
    - 11.6% Share in total employment, 14% of GDP, 10.7% Share in India's exports.
- ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 6.jpeg]]
- **Scope of FPI**
- ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 7.jpeg]]
    - Major segments & components of FPI are (from _image above)_
        - Dairy --> Cheese, Milk powder, Flavoured milks
        - Cereals --> Flour, Cornflakes, Alcoholic beverages
        - Fruits & Vegetables --> Juices, Chips, Veg oils
        - Meat/Fisheries --> Frozen & canned
    - By 2025, India’s food processing sector is expected to be worth over half a trillion dollars (PMO data)
    - By 2024, the FPI will potentially attract $33 bn investments and generate employment for 9 million person days (CII estimates)
    - **Why FPI in India/Key Drivers?**
        - Different agro climate support variety of FPIs
        - Raw Material is ✔ (Ranked 1st in spice production, milk production, etc)
        - Cost of production in India is lower by about 40% over a comparable location in EU
        - Proximity to key export destinations, Proactive govt. policy & support
        - Increasing disposable income, Change in consumer taste and preference
- **Significance of FPI**
    - **Economic**:
        - Increase in farmers income → value addition for raw material
        - Inflow of foreign exchange through exports/investments
        - Food inflation can be controlled as the shelf life of the product is increased & year long availability is ensured
        - Employment generation in non-farm areas and reduce disguise unemployment
    - **Social**:
        - Reduce malnutrition and hunger by enabling food fortification and eliminating food wastage (as per UN 1/3rd of food is wasted)
        - Gender empowerment (as 70% of animal husbandry is under women)
        - Nearly 66% of nearly 25 lakh unorganized units are located in rural areas → Great potential for growth of the rural areas
    - **Environmental**:
        - Crop diversification is promoted by FPI leading to healthier environment
        - Food wastage at harvest, post-harvest, distribution and storage stages can be reduced
- **Location**
    - Cover using content given in Geography Topic
- **Upstream and downstream requirement**
    - **Upstream requirement**: operations in which the materials **flow into** the organization (aka backward linkage)
        - These include: Accessibility to raw materials; Modern extraction techniques; Storage & transport facilities for raw materials; Quality testing facilities; Workforce
        - Eg: Access to dairy for icecream unit or access to vegetables for edible oil unit
    - **Downstream requirement**: operations which in which the materials **flow away** from the organization; Actual processing forms part of this stage (aka forward linkage)
        - These include: Processing techniques; Machinery; Distribution; Retail stores; Logistic management; Marketing; Inventory Mgmt; Workforce
        - Processing can be of three stages: Primary (from wheat to flour), Secondary (from flour to multigrain flour), Tertiary (making biscuits/bakery products)
            - Eg: Icecream sent to retail stores via cold chain network; Edible oil products sent to grocery stores through distributors and agents
- **Supply Chain Management**:
    - A supply chain is the network of all the individuals, organizations, resources, activities and technology involved in the creation and sale of a product/service. It encompasses everything from the delivery of source materials from the supplier to the manufacturer through to its eventual delivery to the end user.
- ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 8.jpeg]]
- **Challenges faced by FPI (_analyse it using supply chain mgmt levels_)**
    - Out of the country’s total agriculture and food produce, only 10 per cent is processed (compared to Indonesia, Malayasia 70-80% → this shpws there are challenges faced which are acting as a hindrance to growth
    - **At Supplier level**:
        - Small and dispersed marketable surplus due to fragmented land holdings
        - Mismatch between the requirements of industry and supply of agri-produce by the farmers (need of the hour is adhering to the quality standards)
    - **At Production level**:
        - Informalization in FPI: almost 75% → lack of access to modern technology & equipment → Inefficient system
        - Industry is highly fragmented and is dominated by the unorganized sector
        - Small Scale: Low value addition by Indian FPI players makes the whole process unviable as it becomes difficult to market the processed product
    - **At Storage/Transport level**:
        - Lack of efficient supply chain infrastructure eg: gaps in cold chain capacity leading to wastages
    - **At Consumption Stage**:
        - Mindset issues that fresh is healthy and processed is not (an awareness campaign is reqd. which promotes that packaged food having FSSAI mark cannot be adulterated)
        - No confident about the quality of product
    - **Governance challenges**:
        - Legal & Bureaucratic hurdles: Multiple clearances are required such as ‘Change in land use’, environmental clearances, registration, etc. Laws such as ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES ACT, labour laws impeded growth of FPI
        - Cooperation challenges where some states are proactive while others are not
        - Lack of comprehensive policy to fulfill the needs of FPI sector
    - **Others**:
        - Inadequate training to entreprenuers and skill building for prospective employees
        - Weak infra for R&D
        - Lack of credit as FPIs are generally MSMEs (~98%)
- **Measures taken**
    - 100% FDI in FPI through automatic route; 100% FDI in food product e-commerce through automatic route
    - FPI is one of key thrust areas under the ‘MAKE IN INDIA’ Programme
    - **Finance**:
        - Special fund of ₹2000 crores in NABARD to provide affordable credit to FPIs
        - FPI and agro-warehousing come under PSL norms of RBI
        - 100% exemption of income tax on profit for new food processing units under INCOME TAX ACT
        - Tax rebates given under to units under AGRICULTURE EXPORT ZONES;
        - ELECTRONIC NEGOTIABLE WAREHOUSE RECEIPT (E-NWR by WDRA) System can be used to get loans, extend the sales period (to avoid distress sale), it can also be directly traded (reducing exchange costs)
    - FSSAI has launched 1) FOOD REGULATORY PORTAL (single interface for food businesses), 2) Vision of ONE NATION ONE FOOD LAW, 3) Replaced manual inspections with digital inspections, 4) strengthened food testing infrastructure, prescribed and updates quality standards
    - Institutions such as APEDA, INDIAN INSTITUTE OF FOOD PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY (IIFPT - to fulfill HRD needs)
    - AGRI EXPORT POLICY 2018: help exporters with SANITARY AND PHYTO-SANITARY (SPS) issues via APEDA, FSSAI, and other bodies
    - Legal: MODEL CONTRACT FARMING ACT 2018
    - **Marketing & SCM Schemes**:
        - E-NAM
        - KISAN RAILS, KRISHI UDAAN
        - PM-GRAM SADAK YOJANA, BHARATMALA, and SAGARMALA
    - **PM KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA**: Central **Sector** Scheme with Rs. 6000 crore allocation; Operated via following components:-
        - Mega Food Parks: 39 are funded of which 22 are operational; eg: ZORAM MEGA FOOD PARK set up in Mizoram
        - OPERATION GREENS: Aim is to enhance value realisation of TOP farmers; Price stabilisation; Increase FPIs; Setting up of a market intelligence network
            - Budget 2021-22: Expanded from TOP to 22 other persishable products
        - Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure: 298 Cold chain projects – 192 operationa as on 31st January 2020
        - Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages: financial assistance is provided for setting up of primary processing centers/ collection centers at farm gate and modern retail outlets at the front end
        - Human Resources and Institutions
        - Food Safety and Quality Assurance Infrastructure
    - Budget 2021-22: Proposed to introduce PRODUCTION LINKED INCENTIVE (PLI) scheme for FPI
    - **PM FORMALISATION OF MICRO FOOD PROCESSING ENTERPRISES SCHEME (PM FME SCHEME)**: Centrally **Sponsored** Scheme with total outlay of 10,000 crore over 5 years; Has following components:
        - ONE DISTRICT ONE PRODUCT (ODOP) Approach: Identification of product for each distt. keeping in mind its existing clusters and availability of raw material
        - SEED CAPITAL TO SHG: Seed capital @ Rs. 40,000/- per SHG member
        - Existing individual micro food processing units desirous of upgrading their units can avail credit-linked capital subsidy at 35% of the eligible project cost with a maximum ceiling of Rs.10 lakh per unit.
        - Capacity building and & training
        - Support to FPOs, SHGs, Producer Cooperatives
    - Dedicated Investors' Portal and mobile application called 'NIVESH BANDHU'
- **Way Forward**
    - According to CII estimates, food-processing sector has the potential of attracting US $33 billion of investment in 10 years and generate employment of 9 million person-days. The food processing sector in India is clearly an attractive sector for investment and offers significant growth potential to investors.
    - With the bourgeoning (expanding) urban and young population, demand for processed food items is set to increase in the coming years. The FPI in India needs to gear up to meet the demand by investing in necessary infrastructure. The industry requires a steady flow of raw materials from the producers/farmers meeting specific quality standards and at stable prices.

- _Notice how Second part of the question is repeated & is similar to second part asked in 2020_

## CROPS & CROPPING PATTERNS
- **Basics**:
    - **Cropping pattern** is the proportion of area under different crops at a point of time. A change in cropping pattern implies change in proportion of area under different crops. It indicates the temporal and/or spatial arrangement of crops in a particular area.
- ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 10.jpeg]]
- **Factors affecting cropping pattern**:
- ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 11.jpeg]]
    - **Agronomical**
        - Resource related factor (irrgation, soil)
            - eg: Black soil → Cotton
            - Climate of the region: Juar, bajra in summar where as wheat in summers
            - Food habits of people leading to more rice in southern states
            - Irrigation availability → rice in Punjab/Haryana whereas coarse grains in Bundelkhand
            - Availability of labour affects growth of plantation areas
        - Technology related (fertilizer, seeds)
    - **Economic**
        - Price related
        - International market
        - Transport (Vegetables near city)
        - Industrial proximity (eg sugarcane quickly loses its sucrose)
    - **Institutional**
        - Govt policies (MSP, GR etc)
- **Green Revolution**
    - **Pre GR**:
        - Low yeid varities of wheat and rice- food insecurity
        - Millets dominant (before the GREEN REVOLUTION of the 1960s, millets made up around 40% of all cultivated grains, contributing more than wheat and rice. The production of rice has doubled and wheat tripled since then, while that of millets has declined)
    - **Post GR**:
        - **Impact on crop variety**
            - Food security- but dominance of wheat and rice- millets, pulses, oilseeds, barley on margins- increased intersrop diversities
            - Imports of pulses and oilseeds increased drastically
        - **Public health**
            - Cereal reduced hunger - use in PDS
            - But not addresed micronutrient malnutrition- More than a third of india lives on alarmingly low levels of protein
            - Like AMR- pesticide getting resistant to pesticies- inc chemicals in food production
        - **Ecological**
            - Degradation of soil- due to intensive cropping, lack of crop diversification
            - Overuse of water- more soil salinity in irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana
            - Flow of water with fertilizers- eutrophication in seas
            - Pesticides, insecticides in food chain- bio-accumulation
        - **Regional and Interstate disparities**
            - Bullock capitalist in Punjab, Haryana vs small and marginal farmer elsewhere
        - Bringing GREEN REVOLUTION in Eastern India (2011)- inc rice and wheat for food security in Assam, Bihar, Orissa and make them self-sufficient
            - Reduce pressure on Punjab, Haryana- minimise negative impact
            - Transport cost saving
    - **Need for Sustainable GR/Way forward for Agri**
        - Need technology for arid/semi arid regions
        - Climate change resillient agri
        - Inc prod of pulses, oilseeds, fisheries, animal husnadry- i.e rainbow revolution not just green
        - Soil management, testing, right micro-nutrients
        - Biofortified varieties- like GOLDEN RICE (vit A enriched), use of Bio-tech extensively
        - Food processing linkages- small scale plants
        - Institutional- better micro/macro credit, storage, transport eith pvt sector help
        - Env- ZBNF, Organic, bio-fert, bio-pesticides, indigeneous knowledge
- **Evident changes in cropping pattern**:
    - Gradually for better price realization farmers are shifting from food to non crops (evident from food crops having 80% of the gross cropped area at independence to 72% today)
    - Horticulture crop production (305.4 MT in 2017-18) has recently overtaken the total foodgrain (279.5 MT in 2017-18) production in India
    - Medicinal plants, oil seeds are getting special attention (so that oil imports could be reduced)
    - Under food crops, about 82% of the area has been put to cultivation of cereals such rice and wheat
    - The area under millets to the total area under cereal crops has declined significantly from 48 per cent in 1950-51 to about 25 per cent in 2016
- **Conservation Agriculture**: Based on three pillars:
    - **Crop Diversification**: practised through crop rotation, intercropping
        - +ves: Breaks the life cycle of pests; Optimum usage of nutrients and evenly distribute;
    - Minimal soil movement: practised through zero tillage farming
    - Soil coverage: practised through covering the soil with residue of previous crop
    - **Constraints**: Crop residues being used for fodder; Need for seeders to plant w/o tillage which are expensive; Above excercise is knowledge intensive
- **Zero Budget Natural Farming**
    - Zero budget as farming is done without using any credits or spending any money
    - Natural Farming as without use of chemicals
    - It has 4 pillars: Bijamitra (seed treatment); Jiwamitra (no fertilizers/pesticides); Mulching (keeping soil covered even when in use); Waaphasa (soil moisture)
    - In June 2018, Andhra Pradesh rolled out an ambitious plan to become India’s first State to practise 100% natural farming by 2024
    - NITI AAYOG has been among the foremost promoters of Mr. PALEKAR and the ZBNF method.
    - However, more research & understanding is needed before this is taken at larger scale
    - ICAR has also constituted a committee to look into viability and further scaling up of ZBNF
- **Issues in agriculture today**:
    - Cultivation of water intensive crops despite low ground water levels
    - Use of excess quantities of fertilizers/pesticides without considering the existing soil quality resulting in water pollution and reduction in soil fertility
- **New Strategies**:
    - **Relay Croppping**: Cropping different crops one after the other Wheat → Onion → Lady finger (promotes better distribution of labour, less insects)
    - **Strip Cropping**: Planting wheat and say corn/soyabean in alternate strips (used in USA, can be used where we have large lands)

#### 2019: How far is INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEM (IFS) helpful in sustaining agricultural production?
- **Integrated Farming System**
    - Integration of farm enterprises such as cropping system, animal husbandry, fisheries, forestry for opt utilisation of resources and bringing prosperity to farmer.
    - Help sustaianable agri-minimise intensive farming which affects land
    - Eg- same farm having dairy production, crops, forestry etc
    - **Benefits**:
        - **Ecological**
            - Ingredients for organic farming- cattle dung for manure- use of ther recyclable material in other activity
            - Multiple uses of water
            - Agro forestry- reduce deforestation in forest areas
            - Organic waste can help generate biogas- less dependence on fossils
        - **Economic**
            - Small size farmer benefit-poverty reductiom
            - Steady income in all seasons due to diversification of activity as well as crop diversification
            - Risk coverage in event of crop failures
            - More emp to tackle disguised employment
    - However it is not the panacea of all problems related to agriculture and other measures such as _{quote various factors}_ are needed to sustain agriculture

#### 2018: Emphasis on certain crops brought about changes in cropping patterns in recent past? Elaborate the emphasis on millets production and consumption?
- **Emphasis on certain crops**
    - Pushing only rice and wheat in the public distribution system, rendering the cultivation of millets economically unviable
    - MSP of 22 crops but physical procurement only of rice and wheat for PDS- Production of rice and wheat grew at expense of pulses, oilseeds, millets etc
    - The gain in the wheat production has come at the cost of millets and sorghum as wheat has been considered superior over them
    - Cover other points from above notes
- **Significance of Millets** (coarse grain- Ragi, Bajar, Jowar)
    - Nutritionally superior: Rich in dietary fibres (eg Ragi in calcium, bajra in iron), resistant starches, vitamins and essential amino acids. Eminent agriculture scientist M. S. SWAMINATHAN has said India needs a nutrition revolution (overcome malnutrition issues)
    - Aid in enhancing soil organic content by adding nutrients into the soil
    - Slower release of glucose- reduces risk of diabetes & other lifestyle related diseases
    - Called miracle grains and ‘crops of the future“ as can grow under harsh/arid conditions- climate change factor
    - Dual purpose crop- food as well as fodder- supplements animal husbandry
    - Nearly 40 percent of the food produced in India is wasted every year. Millets do not get destroyed easily, and some of the millets are good for consumption even after 10-12 years of growing
    - Gluten free food- help counter celiac disease, youth fad with gluten free food (solution for lifestyle problems)
    - Economically better as they have shorter cultivation cycles, lower investment, etc
- **Millets production revival**
    - The area under millets to the total area under cereal crops has declined significantly from 48 per cent in 1950-51 to about 25 per cent in 2016
    - **Why declined?**- change in consumption pattern, unavailibility, rice-wheat dominance
    - Govt- NATIONAL YEAR OF MILLETS-2018, UN Agreed to celebrate INT YEAR OF MILLETS in 2023
    - Increase in MSP support by the govt. and inclusion in MID-DAY MEAL as well as PDS by various states
    - Millet mission under NFSA- Makka and Jau, Sub mission on Nutri-cereals- Jowar, Bajra, Ragi
    - Orissa- announced to spend 100cr on Millet mission in 2018
    - Calling millets ‘orphan crops,’ SWAMINATHAN has called for greater investment in millet research to add variety to India’s food basket
    - #LETSMILLET CAMPAIGN in Bengaluru to induce behavioral change
    - Overall there is a need to change the narrative towards coarse grains and need to rebrand them as super foods

#### 2016: Reasons for declining rice and wheat yield in the cropping system? How crop diversification is helpful to stabilize the yield of the crop in the system?
- Initially during GR, R-W yield increased 3 to 5 times due to HYV, chemical fertilizers, pesticides etc- but gain of that time becoming pain as dec in yield.
- **Reasons for declining rice and wheat yield**
    - Less yeild due to soil health worsening from excessive fertilizer use- inc in input cost for farmer
    - Declining water table- less GW- affects yield
    - Earlier farmers ignored crop rotation and use of pulses- impacted nitrogen fixation
    - Research on improving rice and wheat variteis also now lagging due to emphasis on other climate resiillient crops
    - Small landholding also affects yeild
    - In canal irrigated areas, under a waterlogged condition, rice crop is grown as it is not possible to grow any other crop → this monocropping is leading to reduction in yields
    - Rice as compared to other cereals and pulses is a high GHG emitting crop; over the years CC had led to reduced yields
- **C.D imp for stabilising yeild**
    - **Crop diversification** refers to a shift from the regional dominance of one crop to production of a number of crops.. CROP DIVERSIFICATION PROGRAMME (CDP), a sub scheme of RASHTRIYAKRISHIVIKASYojana (RKVY)
- **Benefits of crop diversification**
    - **Address env issues**:
        - Providing time for soil to regenerate minerals; Nitrogen fixation through growing legumes
        - Agro-forestry (eg: fruits based on the edges) can act as windbreak thus protecting current yield
    - **Address socio-eco issues**:
        - Has ability to correct skewed cropping pattern in regions like Marathwada, Bundelkhand and other rainfed regions- grew water intesive crops like rice and sugarcane but led to crop failures. C.D can help in chosing the right crop for the region
        - Stability in income as prices of single crop can reduce during bumper harvest
        - Crop rotation with pulses will stabilise the yeild of pulses along with other crops like rice, wheat etc
        - No complete dependence on single cropping
        - Reduction in inputs costs
        - boosting resistance to pests and diseases
        - Capturing new market opportunities
- **Way Fwd**: Studies, and even the NITI AAYOG, have indicated that districts with better market infrastructure, like network of roads and storage, help in crop diversification. Thus need to focus on them too.

#### 2020: What are the major factors responsible for making rice-wheat system a success? In spite of this success how has this system become bane in India?
- **Factor made R-W system success**
    - GREEN REVOLUTION- HYV varieties of R-W for food security
    - Favourable temperature in southern india (they are high enough) to grow tropical crops such as rice more than three times in a year
    - Lack of market and storage facilities for horticultural products leading to greater focus on cereals
    - Traditionally, the Minimum Support Prices for wheat and rice have been maintained reasonably high (in comparison to millets such as Jowar and Bajra). This has helped the farmers to increase their production
    - Technology has made it highly remmunerative
    - Increase in incomes have led to change in consumption patterns as coarse cereals being considered inferior goods
- **How rice what system bane** (covered in GR impacts)

#### 2009: Elaborate the steps taken by the Government for regionally differentiated approach to increase crop production and diversification in the country (use it as framework while making notes)
- List down govt schemes for various crops and show its impact on regions good and bad for them
    - Bringing GR to East 2010-11
    - Punjab-Haryana-
    - INTEGRATED SCHEME OF OILSEEDS, PULSES, OIL PALM AND MAIZE (ISOPOM) have been designed to give flexibility to the states as per their agro climatic and socio-economic conditions, to utilize funds for the choice of crops
    - NATIONAL MISSIONS ON BAMBOO AND COCONUT had been deployed for crop diversification and by-product utilization to enrich the returns of farmers as per the regional needs
    - Millets scheme- favour rainfed areas like Marathwada
    - NATIONAL SAFFRON MISSION 2010- Kashmir
    - NATIONAL PROG FOR ORGAIN PRODUCTION (NPOP)- Organic farming benefit - areas of intesive cultivation like punjab harayana
    - Tea board, coffe board, rubber board- plantation areas in darjeeling, kerela etc
    - Animal husbandry- IFS [In 2020 ANIMAL HUSBANDRY INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT FUND (AHIDF) was announced with outlay of 15k crore - where projects would be eligible for a loan upto 90% along with interest subvention]

## IRRIGATION AND FARM MECHANIZATION
- **Basic Stats**:
    - **Irrigation** is the artificial supply of water to crops for the purpose of agricultural production.
    - Irrigated area accounts for nearly 48.8% of agricultural land in India. The remaining 51.2 per cent is rainfed. (ICAR data)
    - About 80 per cent of the current water use is drawn by agriculture (while remaining by indus then domestic sector)
- **Need for Irrigation**: Ensures food security; Newer HYV seeds req more water;
    - **Concept of Cropping Intensity**: Due to inability to expand net sown area further on one hand and rising needs of population on the other hand - increasing Cropping Intensity (GCA/NSA) becomes inevitable. Irrigation is one of the measures to raise Cropping Intensity (other being Fertilisers, Crop Rotation, Mixed Cropping, Relay Cropping, etc)
    - _KAUTILYA in ARTHASHASTRA said Agriculture cannot be made solely dependent on rains as it amounts to gambling with the nature..._
    - Mean productivity (agri produce per hectare) of irrigated land is more than rain-fed land
- **Types based on source**:
    - ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 12.jpeg]]
    - **Overall**: (no need to refer image use these %s)
        - GW (tubewells/wells) = 64%
        - Canals = 23%
        - Tanks = 02%
        - Other sources = 11%
    - **Tube Wells**: Highest area covered but impacts groundwater
    - **Canals**: 2nd most important source (eg INDIRA GANDHI CANAL PROJECT)
        - Inundation canals- supply water from rivers during river overflow, seasonal
        - Perennial canals- supply from artificial reservoirs, all through the year
    - **Tank Irrigation**- especially in South India- as rivers are not pernnial, and it diff to dig wells in deccan rocks
    - **Multipurpose River valley projects**- DAMODAR VALLEY (in West Bengal), SARDAR SOROVAR (Narmada)
    - **River Interlinking projects**
    - **New irrigation model**: Sub-surface porous vessels (SSPV) for irrigation in desert villages
- **-ve impacts**: (talk abt each type of irrigation one by one)
    - High dependence on tube wells requires supply of cheap fuel and electricity
    - Capillary action brings up the salt in water inundated fields which are fed by canals eg: Reh soils
    - Reduction of river flow results in reduced discharge of water into the sea. This may cause coastal erosion and salt water intrusion in the nearby fields. Too much reliance on canal/dams disturbs the ecological flow of river & thus impacting acquatic species
    - Skewed balance of input and output: India’s agricultural sector accounts for ~80 percent of groundwater extraction for irrigation purposes, but contributes only 15 percent to the country’s GDP
    - Diplated infrastructure of canal leads to loss of precious water in transit eg: Canals from JAYAKWADI DAM on Godavari are worn out & leading to 35-40% water leakage in transit before reaching Marathwada
    - Limited success of tank irrrigation - as tanks dry during dry seasons, lifting of water and carrying it to fields is a strenuous and costly exercise
    - Climate change and environment
    - According to the country’s minor irrigation census 2013-14, 87.86% of groundwater wells are owned by marginal, small and semi-medium farmers having landholding up to four hectares (thus regulation of tube wells becomes a catch 22 situation)
- **Measures Taken**:
    - River Interlinking
    - Budget 2017- Dedicated irrigation fund in NABARD
    - Asked CWC to complete pending projects under ACCELERATED IRRIGATION BENEFIT PROGRAM (AIBP)
    - Solar Irrigation- solar pumps
    - NATIONAL WATERSHED PROJECTS
    - INDIRA-GANDHI CANAL
    - Multipurpose river valley projects- SARDAR SAROVAR
    - **PRADHAN MANTRI KRISHI SINCHAYEE YOJANA (PMKSY)**
        - It provides a sound framework for the expansion as well as effective use of water in irrigation.
        - It focuses on four broad areas — ACCELERATED IRRIGATION BENEFITS PROGRAMME (AIBP), HAR KHET KO PANI, PER DROP MORE CROP and WATERSHED DEVELOPMENT
        - Decentralised state level planning through drawing up a DISTRICT IRRIGATION PLAN (DIP) and a STATE IRRIGATION PLAN (SIP)
    - **KUSUM SCHEME**
        - Farmers are encouraged to install Solar pump tube wells for irrigation → less diesel consumption in pumpsets
        - Farmers, panchayats, cooperatives can install upto 2 MW renewable power plants in their barren / cultivable lands
        - Above people can sell the excess electricity to the DISCOMS. Its price will be decided by the respective STATE ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS (SERC)
        - ₹ ₹ Funding? Union 30%+ State 30%+ Bank Loan 30% +10% by the farmer himself
        - Benefit? consumption of Diesel & Thermal electricity will decline → 27 million CO2 emission reduced / per year
- ECONOMIC SURVEY 2018-19 suggests a **transition from land productivity to irrigation water productivity**, which emphasizes on more crops per drop, improving total nutrition per drop and total food crops per drop. This is due to various factors such as: Climate change

#### 2019: Elaborate the impact of NATIONAL WATERSHED PROJECT in increasing agricultural production from water-stressed areas
- NATIONAL WATERSHED PROJECT - WB assisted imp by Ministry of Rural dev to achieve objectives of PMKSY
    - Help PMKSY in hydrology and water management, agricultural irrigation, capacity building of locals to manage water, monitoring
    - NWP supports INTEGRATED WATERSHED MGMT PROGRAM through technical assistance
    - Primary focus will be paid to the nine States facing higher level of water scarcity viz. Andhra Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan and Telangana.
    - It’ll create watershed assets for the PRADHAN MANTRI KRISHI SINCHAYI YOJANA
    - Watershed “plus” approach= local participation, skilling, employment opportunities. Strategies ensure that watershed is not discontinued after funding stops.
    - When completed, NWP will convert 12% of wasteland into arable land
- **How benefits agri**
    - Ensures Har khet ko paani, per drop more crop in agri
    - Restoration of ecological balance in the degraded and fragile water-stressed areas by increasing vegetative cover and decrease soil erosion through afforestation and crop plantation
    - Transformation of dry patches of land to fertile farms- better crop production
    - Improved Ground water storage
    - Reduced surface runoff- thereby reducing soil erosion and land degradation
    - Construction and maintanance of Canals- help sow crops in dry lands
    - Water harvesting of rain water- store in ponds, tanks
    - Emp for constructing water structures under MGNREGA- non farm income
    - For example, a watershed project in BANGARU, Telangana has increased crop yields and cropping intensity significantly. This is also accompanied by a shift towards higher-value crops especially horticultural crops.
    - Even in the areas where large size dams and irrigation canals are not available, the availability of water will increase.
- **General Info on Watershed and Watershed Management**
    - ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 13.jpeg]]
    - A **watershed** is the geographic area through which water flows across the land and drains into a common body of water - stream, river, lake, or ocean. The watershed boundary follows the highest ridgeline around the stream channels which separates the water flow which may be basically rainwater, groundwater, water from melting snow etc. and meet at the bottom or lowest point of the land where water flows out of the watershed. Watershed can be as small as few hectares as in case of a pond or may be as large as hundreds of square kms as in case of rivers.
    - **Watershed management**
        - Watershed management refers to efficient management and conservation of surface and groundwater resources.
        - It involves prevention of runoff and storage and recharge of groundwater through various methods like percolation tanks, recharge wells.
        - However, in broad sense watershed management includes conservation, regeneration and judicious use of all resources – natural (like land, water, plants and animals) and human within a watershed. It brings about the balance between natural resources on the one hand and society on the other through community participation.
    - **Significance of watershed management in water resource management in India**:
        - Rain-fed agriculture accounts for 51% of India's cropped area. With huge tract of land falling under arid and semi-arid region, Watershed Management is the most viable option in the rain fed areas of the country.
        - Watershed management mitigates both droughts and floods, ensures groundwater recharge, checks water scarcity and ensures food security.
        - Watershed management can help to control the pollution of water resources as runoff from rainwater and snowmelt can contribute significant amounts of pollution into the lake or river.
        - As watershed boundary do not coincide with political boundary, its management will directly help mitigation water resource crisis in its downstream regions.
    - **Success Stories and Initiatives**
        - The success of watershed management in RALEGAN SIDDHI village, Maharashtra has been remarkable. Through watershed management, the village which was perennially drought hit was made water surplus. It boosted the economic activities and made the village and villagers self-reliant bringing about a significant environmental and social change.
        - The JAL KRANTI ABHIYAN launched by the Government of India in 2015–16 has Watershed Management as a key component in ensuring water security through per capita availability of water in the country.
        - ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 2.png]]
        - Content from NCERT: HARYALI is a watershed development project sponsored by the Central Government which aims at enabling the rural population to conserve water. NEERU-MEERU (Water and You) programme (in Andhra Pradesh) and ARVARY PANI SANSAD (in Alwar, Rajasthan) have taken up constructions of various water-harvesting structures such as percolation tanks, dug out ponds (Johad), check dams, etc. through people’s participation. Tamil Nadu has made water harvesting structures in the houses compulsory.
    - **Issues**:
        - Lack of holistic approach: Most of the watershed management programmes in India do not consider the groundwater in the planning and the sole focus is placed on the surface water
        - Lack of community participation
        - Multiple organizations: At present in India, there are a number of national, international and nongovernment organizations working on watershed development related projects creating both overlaps and gaps
        - Top down approach: Programmes are undertaken on a highly regulatory, centralized and target driven approach and are controlled and regulated from top to bottom
    - **Way Fwd**:
        - Watershed mapping for all India planning to include all the watersheds as each one affects the other. E.g. ALL INDIA SOIL AND LAND USE SURVEY ORGANISATION has released a MICRO WATERSHED ATLAS OF INDIA in 2019
        - Creating local ownership: Some examples such as NAIGAON and JALGAON watershed management project where the community participation with “Pani Panchayats” created a sense of ownership among the people
        - Involving NGOs to mobilize and build the capacities of the villagers and also bring the requisite technical and managerial expertise. E.g. SUJALA (for Karnataka Watershed Development) and GRAMYA (Uttarakhand watershed development) projects
    - ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 14.jpeg]]
    - Other benefits of Watershed management

#### 2016: What is water-use efficiency? Describe the role of micro-irrigation in increasing the water-use efficiency
- **Water Use Efficiency**: the ratio between effective water use and actual water withdrawal. It characterizes, in a specific process, how effective is the use of water.
    - India accommodates more than 17% of the world population and only 4% of fresh water resources, out of which around 80% is used in agriculture alone. This calls for efficient irrigation technologies to increase water-use efficiency.
    - Case Study: NABARD 2018 study highlighted - While Punjab and Haryana report the highest land productivity for rice (4 tonnes per hectare), the irrigation water productivity (IWP) for these states is relatively low at 0.22 kg/m3. Rainfed Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, in contrast, display higher levels of IWP at 0.68 kg/m3 and 0.75 kg/m3 (ignore the figures just remember that water used in PJ is 3 times more than JH/CG)
    - Israel one of the driest country in world- making agri revoultion through micro-irrigation
    - With changing climate it has become all the more important to efficiently utilize the scarce water resources.
- **Micro-irrigation** can be defined as the **application of water at low volume and frequent interval** under low pressure to plant root zone. Types of MI are Drip Irrigation, Sprinkler Irrigation, Subsurface Irrigation, Porous pipes, etc.
- **Significance of micro-irrigation for India**:
    - Water use efficiency: It helps in significant reduction of water loss due to runoff, evaporation etc. It further aids soil health management and prevents water logging. There is an intersectoral competition for water
        - Eco survey- Flood irrigation efficiency in irrigation is 30%, Micro-irrigation is 65%
    - Energy efficiency: Irrigation cost saving as energy costs are saved
    - Infrastructure setup is quicker to install compared to large structures such as dams, canals
    - Improves productivity
    - Fertilizer use efficiency: Can help deliever fertilizers with precision
- **Govt schemes**-
    - PRADHAN MANTRI KRISHI SINCHAYEE YOJANA - Sub program = “Per drop more crop”- Inc water use efficiency through mircro irrigation (this program has subsumed all the previous initiatives for micro-irrigation into it)
- **Challenges faced** (coverage of micro irrigation is low currently <15% of potential area)
    - High initial costs
    - Repair cost is generally not covered in insurance schemes
    - Requires continuity in power supply
    - Policy issues: High GST 12%; Delay in disbursal of subsidy
    - Destroyed by man-animal conflicts on field (broken by elephants)
    - Technical support is needed to tackle day to day challenges such as rodent attack on pipes
- Recently NABARD Report (2018) pointed out the need to shift from land productivity to IWP implying that there is a need to realign the focus from maximizing productivity per unit of land area to per unit of water, thus achieving ‘more crop per drop’. The report suggested shifting the major chunk of rice production to India’s central and eastern states like Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, while encouraging wheat cultivation through sustainable irrigation in the rice-growing regions of Punjab and Haryana.

#### 2016: What is allelopathy? Discuss its role in major cropping systems of irrigated agriculture
- **Allelopathy** refers to a biochemical phenomena where one plant/animal influences the germination, growth, survival and reproduction of another plant using biochemicals secretion by one of the plants.
- The impact can be beneficial (positive allelopathy) or detrimental (negative alleolopathy). It is observed and studied in plant-plant, plant-microbes and plant–animal interactions. Allelochemicals are found in flowers, stem, leaves, which can be used to aid beneficially in agriculture.
- **Role in major cropping systems of irrigated agriculture**:
    - Sustainable weed management: Phytotoxins and allelopathic tendencies of crops from social forestry can be used to reduce and inhibit the growth of weeds.
    - Straw mulching: Chemicals released by it reduce the incidence of weeds and pests. It can improve soil fertility and moisture retention by increasing organic content.
    - Intercropping and crop Rotation: Knowledge about the alleopathic relations between plants can be used effectively in intercropping to improve yield. It has been observed that intercropping of sorghum, sesame produced better output than cotton alone.
    - Effective application of allelopathy can decrease usage of insecticide, pesticide, and herbicide.
    - Bio pesticides obtained from allelopathic chemicals can be also used for environment friendly agriculture. eg: Planting marigolds (गेंदे का फू ल) in between your crops will help protect them against roundworm attacks.
- Allelopathy is a novel application to improve crop yield to meet the demands of an ever increasing population. However, inadequate research data has resulted in ineffective implementation. It can provide agricultural sustainability, environmental protection, food security, resource conservation and economic viability.

#### 2020: Suggest measures to improve water storage and irrigation system to make its judicious use under depleting scenario
#### Describe the different modes of irrigation practices in India and bring out the relative importance in the field of recent development in irrigation.

### Farm Mechanisation
- **Statistic**: The overall farm mechanization in India has been lower at 40-45 per cent compared to other countries such as USA (95 per cent), Brazil (75 per cent) and China (57 per cent).
- Rapidly growing demand for food has brought forward the need of efficient agriculture. Thus, it becomes imperative to focus on improving intensity of farm mechanisation in country.
- **Advantages of farm mechanisation**
    1.  It lowers cost of cultivation, as it saves human labour and cattle.
    2.  Farmers renting equipment have reported yields rising by around 20%.
    3.  Reduction of risk of weather and non-availability of labour thus minimising post harvest wastage.
    4.  Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) which rent out machinery to small farmers, service centres etc., for employment of rural youth.
    5.  Improved working conditions and enhanced safety for farmers.
    6.  Conversion of uncultivable land to agricultural land through advanced tilling technologies.
- **Difficulties in farm mechanisation**
    1.  Indian agriculture is highly diverse in terms of farm size and soil types. So farms need customised farm machinery and equipment for different regions of the country.
    2.  Majority of small cultivators are poor who are not in a position to purchase the costly machinery like tractors, combine harvesters etc., coupled with poor knowledge of farmers.
    3.  Due to land fragmentation, the farm size is less. As a result of this, farm machinery generally remains under-utilised.
    4.  Skewed and seasonal usage due to crop growth in rainy season. There is lack of sufficient irrigation to use it round the year. As still 65% of lands in India are not irrigated.
    5.  Increased mechanisation results in surplus draught cattle and their upkeep is a concern for the farmers.
    6.  The lack of repair and replacement facilities especially in the remote rural areas is another hindrance.
- **Recommendations**
    1.  Formation of cooperative for ownership of farm machinery at village level. Supporting the finance of second hand tractors for small farmers.
    2.  Encourage land consolidation and development of land lease market.
    3.  Need to focus research efforts towards design and development of farm machinery suitable for different types of soils, farm sizes and diverse crops.
    4.  Focus on standardisation and quality control especially for farm equipment so as to protect the interest of farmer and increase usage.
    5.  Strengthening the agriculture extension services such as in-field demonstration by the experts.
    6.  Develop a legislative and structural framework that encourages custom hiring (renting) services.
- Though mechanisation has improved the state of agriculture in certain parts of the country, it is still in nascent stage and it will remain so unless concrete measures are taken to propel farmers towards adoption of efficient farm mechanisation practices.

#### Social Forestry
- **Social forestry** refers to the protection and management forests **and** afforestation on barren lands thereby assisting environmental, social and rural development. The NATIONAL COMMISSION ON AGRICULTURE has classified social forestry into three categories:
    - **Urban forestry**: It relates to the raising and management of trees on public and private lands in and around urban centres such as parks, roadside avenues etc.
    - **Rural forestry**: It emphasizes on the promotion of agroforestry and community-forestry.
        - **Agro-forestry** - It is the raising of trees along with agriculture crops on the same agricultural land including waste patches (role of both crops & trees)
        - **Community forestry** - It involves the raising of trees on public or community land such as the village pasture, roadside, strips along railway lines, and schools etc. (land is not personal but at community level)
    - **Farm Forestry**: It refers to raising of trees for commercial and non-commercial purposes by farmers on their farm lands (no role of crops)
- ITC SOCIAL FORESTRY INITIATIVE allowed tribal & marginal farmers of Andhra Pradesh to harvest crops annually and eucalyptus trees every 4 years (these trees sequester CO2 & are used in paper making factory) - This project allows ITC to remain carbon positive for more 10 years in a row

## ECONOMICS OF ANIMAL REARING
- **Basics**
    - **Animal Husbandry**- study of various breeds of animal and their mgmt for better production and use of animals resources, derives from husband- one who takes care
    - Importance- DPSP ARTICLE 48- organise A.H on modern and scientific lines
- **Significance**:
    - Employment: agriculture being seasonal in nature could provide employment for a maximum of 180 days in a year
    - Income supplemented (mainly small farmers- poverty alleviation)
    - Social security & religious importance
    - Used for ploughing, carting and transport
    - Mainly woman led activity- promote women emp
- **Challenges**:
    - Lack of Access to credit: Allied activities (livestock, forestry, and fisheries) receive only 10% of the total agricultural credit while they contribute 40% of the agricultural output
    - Insufficient veterinary services and diseases control
    - Comparative preferences for highly productive exotic breeds
    - Safety and quality parameters at the collection centres is almost non-existent
    - Agri and livestock accounts for 18% of gross national emission of India (85% of which are from cattle production system, rice cultivation and ruminant meat)
- **Status**
    - Contributes to 4% of GDP and 25% of agri GDP, 10% of agri labour force
    - In India, livestock wealth is much more equitably distributed than wealth associated with land. About 70 per cent of the livestock market in India is owned by 67 per cent of the small and marginal farmers and by the landless. Thus, growth of the livestock sector would reduce poverty more than growth of the crops sector.
    - Distribution patterns of income and employment show that rural poverty is less in states where livestock accounts for a sizeable share of agricultural income as well as employment
    - Animals are natural capital, which can be easily reproduced to act as a living bank with offspring as interest, and an insurance against income shocks of crop failure, natural calamities and climate change
    - Animal husbandry promotes gender equity as more than 3/4th of the labour demand in livestock production is met by women across the India
- **Dairy**
    - India largest producer of milk, 20% of world production
    - **Govt schemes**
        - WHITE REVOLUTION-by NATIONAL DAIRY DEVELOPMENT BOARD-Chariman VERGHESE KURIEN (2021 will be 100th birth anniversary) - Dairy co-operatives
        - NAKUL SWASTHYA PATRA- Animal Health Card
        - RASHTRIYA GOKUL MISSION- conserve and inc indigenous eg Gir, Sahilwal, Rathi
        - Budget 2019- RASHTRIYA KAMDHENU AAYOG- for genetic upgradation of cows, R&D
        - ANIMAL HUSBANDRY INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT FUND (ATMA NIRBHAR BHARAT stimulus) - 15,000 crore, will incentivise infrastructure investments in dairy, meat processing and animal feed plants; FPOs/MSMEs/Indv farmer contributre 10% and gets 90% as loan
        - NATIONWIDE ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION PROGRAMME (N.A.I.P): 600 chosen districts (incl Aspirational Distt) - aim of the program is to inseminate over 1 crore bovines in 6 months
        - RCEP pullout
        - E-PASHUDHAN HAAT PORTAL: Online portal to connect farmers with breeders
        - Separate Ministry of Fisheries, Animal husbandry and Dairying
    - **Successes**
        - Increases incomes: AMUL Dairy released list of 10 women dairy farmers who became millionaires by seeking milk to the company
        - Removes international asymmetry: marginal and small farmers have only 50-70% of the resources that large and medium farmers have. this gap can be bridged through cooperatives
    - **Challenges**
        - India has the largest bovine population in the world but its milk production per animal is the significantly low
        - Indian dairy exports form less than 1% of total agri exports - despite India’s milk production costs are one of the lowest in the world - the main reason domestic consumption is high, and 70% milk production is by small farmers who lack skill in handling milk commercially
        - Apathy to assistive reproductive tech
        - Lack of veterinary care, small dairy herd (size with each farmer)
        - Preference for exotic breeds and neglect of indigenous breeds
        - Diversion of feed for industrial use eg: biofuels
        - Lack of phytosanitary standards, food safety hygiene for export
        - Non-availability of grazing lands, fodder
        - General: credit issues, lack of space, disease outbreak, small herd size
    - **Way forward**
        - Need 2nd white revolution, Hub and spoke model like food processing plants
        - Dairy farmers need to be given stable and remunerative prices through proper market linkage (Maharashtra farmers spill milk to protest prices during pandemic)
        - Need to fulfil demand of growing population & urbanisation
        - Ensure fodder supply- bring High yielding fodder varieties
- **Fisheries/Blue Revolution**
    - India 2nd largest fish producer in world (exports ~47k cr). BLUE REVOLUTION was launched in India during the 7th FYP during which the government sponsored the FISH FARMERS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (FFDA).
    - The fisheries and aquaculture production **contribute around 1% to India’s GDP** and over 5% to the agricultural GDP, Marine exports constitute about 5% of the total exports, **Coastline 7500 km and EEZ of** 2.3 million sq. Km.
    - Types- Marine (36%) Inland/aquaculture (64%)
    - Imp- source of protein (reduce hunger and malnutrition), inc income (as export potential)
    - SGs manage the sector upto 12 nm, for waters bw 12 nm and upto EEZ the CG is responsible
    - **Significance of Blue Economy**: Fisheries, Renewable Energy (Tidal- Pilot at Vizhinjam coast), Deep sea mining, Coastal and Marine tourism (blue flag certification), Marine agriculture (seaweed), Marine transportation
    - **Challenges**
        - **Catchment Issues**:
            - Lack of resource-specific fishing vessels and reliable resource and updated data
            - Shortage of quality and healthy fish seeds and other critical inputs
            - Use of obsolete technology along with low capital infusion
        - **Processing Issues**:
            - Absence of standardization and branding of fish products
            - Inadequate awareness about nutritional and economic benefits of fish
            - Inadequate infrastructure especially fishing harbours, cold chain and distribution systems, poor processing and value addition
            - Inadequate extension staff for fisheries and training for fishers and fisheries personnel, thus this impact skill development process
        - **Environmental**:
            - Unsustainable fishing vs growing human population: Sri Lanka issue, bottom trawling
            - Discharge of harmful substances like plastic and other wastes deteriorates the aquatic ecosystem
            - Many fisheries management bodies do not heed scientific advice on fish quotas and set catch limits above the recommended maximum amount
        - India is able to exploit only a fraction of the aquaculture potential available to it. India uses only about 40% of the available ponds, tanks and other water bodies for freshwater aquaculture and 15% of total potential of brackish water resources
    - **Achievements in the Fisheries sector under BLUE REVOLUTION 1.0**
        - Enhancement of fish production from 10.26 mn mt (2014-15) to 13.75 mn mt (2018-19)
        - Productivity increased from 2.3 tons per hectare to 3.3 per tons per hectare
    - **Govt schemes**
        - BLUE REVOLUTION 2.0 - develop fisheries in a sustainable manner, Triple the production by 2020, Triple export earnings by 2020, food security
        - NAVIC messaging system - advance forecasts of fishing sites, extreme weather warnings
        - NATIONAL FISHERIES DEV BOARD- inc production, exports, apply modern-tech
        - Impetus to blue revolution (sea weed cultivation) along with 5 new harbours given in latest budget
        - PM MATSAYA SAMPADA YOJANA- KCC for fisherman, forward backward linkages, quality fish fodder
            - Targets: Increasing fish production to 22 million metric tons by 2024-25, Enhancing aquaculture productivity to 5 tons per hectare (from 3 ton), Generating 55 lakh direct and indirect employment opportunities, Doubling the incomes of fishers and fish farmers
        - Separate Ministry of Fisheries, Animal husbandry and Dairying
        - MGNREGA has started to develop the farm ponds, where pisciculture is taking place
        - FISH CRYOBANKS: will facilitate availability of desired fish sperms to farmers (done no where in the world - one of a kind initiative)
        - FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT FUND (FIDF) - which provides loans to SG, UTs, state entities, coop, indv for taking up of the identified investment activities of fisheries development
    - **Way forward**
        - Draft policy on Mariculture- cultivation of marine fishes upto 12 nautical miles
        - MEENA KUMARI COMMITTEE recommended optimum utilization of EEZ
        - Need for improvements in breeding technology, disease control, feeds and nutrition
        - Leveraging the latest information technology; Formulation of public and private policies to provide financial support, enhance skill and make farmers aware and capable to practice sustainable pisciculture
        - Innovative practices developed by the CENTRAL MARINE FISHERIES RESEARCH INSTITUTE (CMFRI) among others need to be popularised, customised and adopted
        - Need for sustainability: FAO points out that nearly 90% of the global marine fish stocks have either been fully exploited, overexploited or depleted (due to too much fishery subsidies)
            - Avoid dumping of harmful waste in marine bodies, enforcing fishing bans during peak breeding seasons, monitoring the use and disposal of fishing gear
            - SDG-14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
- **Meat & Poultry Sector**
    - PINK REVOLUTION- modernisation of meat production processes
    - Imp- source of protein
    - According to a 2016 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE review, India - world's largest beef exporter, accounting for 20% of world's beef trade based on its large water buffalo meat processing industry
    - **Challenges**
        - Maize availability and its cost
        - Unhygienic conditions, Diseases- Bird flu- impacts domestic and exports
        - Lack of marketing, value addition, less target population-culture of veganism
        - Technological threats from lab meats
        - Cattle smuggling across international borders (eg: Bangladesh)
    - **Way forward**
        - Modernisation of abattoirs
        - Educate farmers on livestock diseases
        - Food safety standards
        - India’s long coastline has the potential of becoming the strength of the economy particularly through the exploitation of the BLUE REVOLUTION

#### 2015: Livestock rearing has a big potential for providing non-farm employment and income in rural areas. Discuss suggesting suitable examples
- Covered above

#### 2018: NATIONAL HORTICULTURE MISSION? Success in increasing income of farmers?
- **Horticulture** is the production, including fruits and vegetables, in 2016-17 outstripped food grain output **for the fifth year in a row**.
- Horticulture now accounts for 30% of the agriculture sector’s GDP from nearly 13% cropped area and supports nearly 20% of agricultural workforce.
- **Potential of Horticulture sector**
    1.  India is second largest producer of Vegetables and Fruits.
    2.  Many horticulture crops are short duration crops, and grown in small plots of land, hence small and marginal farmers now prefer to grow them. These crops ensure a quicker cash flow.
    3.  Horticulture is highly labour intensive and availability of cheap labour and less capital input requirements are suitable for poor farmers. Even it is less susceptible to bad monsoon.
    4.  Better incomes, urbanisation, changing consumption and lifestyle patterns have driven demand of fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, medicinal plants and flowers which is addressed by small farms near cities (truck farming).
    5.  India’s import of fruits is rising by 20 per cent per year. All these indicators suggest that demand side prospects for fruits and vegetables are very bright.
- **Challenges in realisation of full potential**
    1.  Lack of market support and paucity of post-harvest produce management chain from farm to fork. Distress sales and mass destruction due to improper post-harvest handling like cold storage and want of processing facilities, lack of refrigerated vehicles to transport.
    2.  The wastage for horticulture crops is between 5 to 15 percent due to high perishability in the case of fruits and vegetables.
    3.  The lack of availability of quality planting material, specially processable and exportable varieties, has been another area of concern.
    4.  Lack of institutional finance. Lack of private investment due to problem of no land leasing and lack of contract farming, cooperative farming. Absence of micro-irrigation infrastructure, research in horticulture crops for higher shelf life.
    5.  Poor enactment of APMC Acts in states, open-ended MSP regime encouraging farmers to grow food grains even though the climate may favour horticulture.
- **Govt initiatives**
    1.  CENTRALLY SPONSORED MISSION FOR INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT OF HORTICULTURE (MIDH) to reduce wastage. Under MIDH, financial assistance is provided for setting up and modernisation of nurseries, seed processing infrastructure.
    2.  MERCHANDISE EXPORTS FROM INDIA (MEIS) under FOREIGN TRADE POLICY 2015-20, incentivises exports of farm products including fruits/vegetables.
    3.  APMCs have been reformed in many states in line with model APMC Act to exclude horticulture crops from it.-benefits supermarket.
    4.  NATIONAL HORTICULTURE MISSION (10th five year plan in 2005-06)
        1.  Centrally spon scheme, envisages inc production and productivity improvement, creation of Post harvest mgmt infrastructure, centre for excellence.
        2.  Role in promoting Horticulture
            1.  Led to one third share, leader in several crops such mango, banana.
            2.  Better income, emp through govt subsidies help.
- **Way forward**
    1.  Vegetable and fruit producers cooperatives, formed on the lines of the milk cooperatives, can be incentivised to bridge the gap between producers and consumers.
    2.  Modern Value Chains: Post-harvest processing and value-addition, which is rather low at present, needs to be stepped up substantially.
    3.  Also needed is an extensive network of refrigerated warehouses to store horticultural products and minimise wastage.
    4.  Government has envisioned to double farm income by 2022 to bring economic prosperity as agriculture sector employs half of the population in country. To realise it, the horticulture sector holds significant importance.

#### 2017: Various types of revolutions? Impact on poverty alleviation and food security?
- GREEN REVOLUTION- bringing GR to N-E
- WHITE REVOLUTION – OPERATION FLOOD (1970), an initiative of NDDB has led to revolution in milk production in India. Transformed India from a milk deficient nation to world’s largest milk producer.
- Yellow rev- oilseeds import
- PINK REVOLUTION
- BLUE REVOLUTION
- SWEET REVOLUTION for honey
- WF- Rainbow revolution- Integrated Farming system
- **Benefits**:
    - These steps have provided avenues for income diversification for farmers.
    - India has become self sufficient in food grain production with the help of green revolution (6 six fold growth in food grain production)

#### 2013: Critical evaluation of Pink Revolution (wrt ensuring better nutrition and health)
- Write challenges & Way Fwd points as discussed above

#### 2006: Blue Revolution (environmental impacts)?
#### White Revolution? Dairy Industry? Role of Village Cooperative Movements?

## STORAGE, TRANSPORT, MARKETING, AGRICULTURAL CREDIT - ISSUES AND RELATED CONSTRAINTS
### Finance
- **Basics**
    - As per NABDARD, about 52 percent of the agricultural households in the country were estimated to be indebted. At all India level, about 60 percent of the outstanding loans were taken from institutional sources which included Government (2.1 percent), Co-operative society (14.8 percent) and Banks (42.9 percent).
    - Reliance on non-institutional sources is due to: (i) lack of collateral security with landless labourers, tenant farmers, and sharecroppers, (ii) poor credit rating, and (ii) involvement in unviable subsistence agriculture.
- **Issues**
    - ECONOMIC SURVEY 2016 found an inverse relation between size of landholding vs. Indebtedness ie. small/marginal farmers are more indebted than big farmers- shows lesser attention to poor farmers.
    - INTERNAL WORKING GROUP of RBI noted possibility of diversion of credit to non-agri purposes (evident from some states having credit disbursal > than their agri GDP of the state)
        - Eg: In Kerala and Tamil Nadu, agricultural credit was almost 180% more than the average agriculture GDP of the state in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 (other states in Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana)
        - Leakage to large businesses (due to loose definition of agri credit)
        - Diversion of agri loan by farmers for other purposes- marriage etc.
    - Imbalance in credit distribution: Though small and marginal farmers constituted 86.2 per cent of total operated holdings and have 47.3 per cent share in the operated area, only 40.9 per cent of them were covered by scheduled commercial banks (bulk loan of SCBs cornered by big land holders).
    - Absence of a proper land leasing framework and lack of records → Difficulty to get institutional agricultural credit.
    - Internal disparity: Allied activities (livestock, forestry, and fisheries) receive only 10% of the total agricultural credit while they contribute 40% of the agricultural output.
    - Red tapism- too many formalities force farmers to depend on non-institutional sources.
- **Measure taken**
    - RBI’s PSL Norms - 8% to agriculture + 10% to Marginal/Small Farmer (PSL share inc by 2% for marginal/small farmers)
    - KISAN CREDIT CARD scheme & interest subvention scheme
    - Financing through ELECTRONIC NEGOTIABLE WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS
    - JOINT LIABILITY GROUPS (JLGs) have been promoted by banks to bring small landless farmer into the fold of formal credit
    - Amendment of the ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES ACT which will instil confidence in the private sector for building large scale storage
    - Encouragement to SHGs, Loan waivers
- **Issues faced by Fin. Insts**
    - Poor recovery, Frequent loan waiver- affect capital of PSU, dual control of RBI and govt, multiple loans on same land.
    - **Issues of Loan Waivers**
        - Moral Hazard- no incentive to be disclipined
        - Undermine honest credit culture- URJIT PATEL
        - Squeeze the fiscal space available for productive investment in agriculture (actual issues is lack of marketable surplus, unremmunerative prices, lack of financial planning)
        - No real debt relied as 40% still non institutional sources (NABARD)
        - WB after 2008 mega waiver- no real inc in pvt consumtion
        - Crowding out of corporate borrowers
        - Create pressure for other states, parties- populism
- **Way Foward**
    - Encourage cooperatives/FPO’s for responsible finance by and to farmers
    - Procedural simplification by banks for credit delivery through rationalisation of its working pattern
    - Loan waiver not solution- focus on enhacing loan repayment culture, also waiver if req should be on case to case basic rather than one size fits all
        - There is a need for more efficient and targetted ways to help farmers
    - Use technology- biometric, data bases- to prevent double loans as well as credit denial
    - The Working Group of RBI recommended that for building a consensus with state govts., the central government should set up a federal institution, on the lines of the GST COUNCIL, to suggest and implement reforms in agriculture.

### Insurance
- **Basics**
- **Need for Insurance**

### Storage
- **Basics**: Storage involves holding and preserving goods from the time they are produced until they are needed for consumption. Similarly storage of inputs (seeds, fertilizers) is also necessary.
    - Need: Ensure round-the-year quality food supply; Improper storage can lead to losses; Food wastage if eliminated could feed one-third of world poor population; Price stabilization; Emergency situation.
    - WH receipts can be used to meet financial needs.
    - Institutions involved: CWC, SWC, FCI, WDRA (objective is to implement NEGOTIABLE WAREHOUSE RECEIPT SYSTEM).
- **Issues in storage**
    - **Farmer**
        - Lack of on farm decentralised storage- leads to distressed selling
        - No cold chain induced transport in case of perishable commodities
        - India’s annual food-grain production is expected to cross 300 million tonnes, the present storage capacity is around a mere 100 million tonnes
    - **FCI**
        - Imbalances in storage facility- 64% was located in the large procurement states like Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh & Chhattisgarh
        - Non adherance to First in First out principle (i.e liquidate the earliest stock) - CAG 2013 report revealed that food grains pertaining to crop years 2008-09 to 2010-11 were lying in the central pool even in March 2012 (disease causing mycotoxins are found in mouldy grain/foods)
        - Open/CAP Storage (Cover and Plinth) of FCI
        - Open ended procurement- excess stock overflow- chances of wastage, stealing
        - Inability to liquidate buffer stock as lack of standard policy- liquidation only on adhoc basis
    - **Cold Storage**
        - Estimated annual production of fruits and vegetables accounts for 18% of our agricultural output- no commensurate cold storage, selective cold storage (of fruits, single vegetable) affects capacity utilisation, per capita availability of F&V is quite low despite being 2nd largest producers.
        - Availability of proper cold storages are important for preserving perishable commodities like milk, meat, eggs, vegetables, fruits (post harvest losses account for ~25% to 30% of production of F&V).
    - **Processer/Miller/Wholesaler**
        - EC Act prevented investment in storage due to adhoc policies on stock limits
    - **General (apply to all)**
        - Hygenic issues, pests spoliage, water destorys due to open silos
- **Measures Taken**
    - RKVY-RAFTAAR, NABARD Agri Infra fund
        - Subsidy for on farm storage
    - PM KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA: Storage infra, finance facilities, food processing
    - NATIONAL HORTICULTURE MISSION- perishable storage infra finance and handholding
    - APEDA- export driven storage along with help in phyto-sanitary measures
    - NATIONAL POLICY ON HANDLING, STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION OF FOODGRAINS in June 2000
        - Declaration of food grains storage as infrastructure
        - Encouragement of mechanical harvesting, cleaning and drying at farm and market level
        - Transportation of grains from farm to silos by specially designed trucks
    - INTEGRATED COLD CHAIN AVAILABILITY PLATFORM - national database that enables active linkage between multiple cold-chain assets across owners, processers, govt agencies (FCI, APEDA), FPOs
        - See CC availability and plan for storage for effective output
    - MEGA FOOD PARK scheme provides infra for storage & processing
    - AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE FUND (central sector scheme which provides debt through interest subvention)
    - Income Tax deductions on capital expenditure allowed at the rate of 150% for setting up and operating cold chain or warehouse for storage of agriculture produce
- **Way Forward**
    - Promote development of small storage structures such as HAPUR TEKKA, PUSA BIN (leads to on-farm storage)
    - SHANTA KUMAR COMMITTEE (2014) for FCI Storage issues
        - Let states do the major procurement, FCI focus on increasing capability of states lagging behind
        - Outsource to CWC, SWC and other private sector co. of storage sector
        - Liquidate buffer stocks in OMSS and export markets for better price realisation
        - Act as an ‘_agency for innovations in Food Management System’_ from procurement to stocking to movement and finally distribution in TPDS, so that overall costs of the system are substantially reduced, leakages plugged
- **Points to remember**
    - Warehouses play an important role in all three situations ie. storage, transport and marketing
    - Logistics like storage, transportation, credit, and market information are crucial for transforming subsistence-agriculture into sustainable, profitable agriculture

### Transport
- **Basics**
    - Transport is regarded as a crucial factor in improving agricultural productivity. It facilitates interaction among geographical and economic regions leading to better price realisation for farmer.
    - Indian farmers incur approx Rs 92k crore per year in post-harvest losses, the primary causes of which are poor storage and transportation facilities.
    - Ironically, according to DALWAI COMMITTEE report, an investment of Rs 89,375 crore—a figure marginally lower —is all it takes to improve the state of storage and transportation facilities for food crops.
- **Issues & Constraints**
    - **Farmer**
        - Dependence on animals to transport grains eg: using bullocks (as small number of villages are joined by railways)
        - Inadequate weather forecast info- impact of rain on produce in transit
        - Kutcha roads- becomes useless in rainy season
        - Long distance to procurement centre- distressed selling
        - Large chain of middlemen (Kutcha/Pakka Adhtiyas, Brokers, Wholesalers, Retailers) - reduce the share of cultivator
        - Non-availability of cold chain induced transport- affects perishables
    - **FCI**
        - Need to move grains from surplus to deficient states
        - Centralised procurement involves extra transportation unlike decentralised
    - **Processer/Wholesalers**
        - Truck traffic jams, state border challenges and harrasment
- **Steps taken**
    - KISAN RAIL: Flagged off 100th rail in 2020
    - KRISHI UDAAN
    - TRANSPORT AND MARKETING ASSISTANCE (TMA) scheme: government would reimburse a certain portion of freight charges and provide assistance for marketing of agricultural produce. (Even fort export)
    - PRADHAN MANTRI GRAM SADAK YOJANA: to provide good all-weather road connectivity to unconnected villages
    - FASTAG- Fast movement of trucks
- **Way Forward**
    - Transport is a burning component of **post-harvest crop management**.
    - **FCI**
        - ASHOK DALWAI COMMITTEE- focus on decentralised procurement by states instead of centralised procuremnet (i.e FCI procuring and then giving to states) - Rather FCI should procure only only the surplus after reducing the state’s need under NFSA.
    - DALWAI COMMITTEE advocates more transporation of horticulture crops by rail for faster movement by goods only trains (as majority of horticulture is by non-train routes as of now).
    - **Farmer**- Need agri consultancy before transport- weather forecast, distance viability, kind of transport for his produce, costs involved
        - Need farm gate procurement
        - FPO’s pooling of produce- more viable for small farmer
    - Railways needs to upgrade its logistics to facilitate the transport of fresh produce directly to export hubs.

### Marketing
- **Agricultural marketing** refers to all the activities, agencies and policies involved in the procurement of farm inputs by the farmers and the movement of agricultural produce from the farms to the consumers.
- **Need**
    - Acts as source of price info, highlight infra weakness, promote value addition, ensure fair price for farmer and consumer, minimise role of middlemen (moneylenders in villages).
- **Types**
    - Tradional- selling by farmer with many intermediary involved
    - E-NAM, E-GRAM
    - Contract Farmimg
    - FPO’s, Co-ops
    - Agri-Future Markets (risk can be hedged)

### Agricultural Produce Market Committee
- **APMC** is a statutory market committee (by state law) constituted by a State Government in respect of trade in certain notified agricultural or horticultural or livestock products.
- Was instituted for first sale to prevent exploitation by local moneylender.
- **Functions of APMC**
    - ensuring transparency in pricing system and transactions taking place in market area;
    - providing market-led extension services to farmers;
    - ensuring payment for agricultural produce sold by farmers on the same day;
    - promoting agricultural processing including activities for value addition in agricultural produce;
    - Publicizing data on arrivals and rates of agricultural produce brought into the market area for sale; and
- **Issues**
    - **To farmer**
        - Lack of storage, transport, market info- distressed sale
        - Rural Primary Markets mainly the periodical markets (haats, fairs) are used to sell directly to consumers or to small rural retailers (less value is gained, these are generally less regulated thus prone to false weights)
        - Absence of standardised grading, substandard weights
    - **General marketing issues**
        - Exporter/Processor cant get desired quality, cannot buy directly
        - Hinders private investemnt in marketing- due to association of traders, commission agents who resist new person
        - Adulteration in cash crops and food-crops
    - **APMC bottlenecks**
        - APMCs play dual role of regulator and Market. Role as regulator is undermined by vested interest in lucrative trade. Generally, member and chairman are nominated/elected out of the agents operating in that market.
        - Monopolistic and restricive markets- prevent direct selling, leads to monopsony (a market situation where there is only one buyer who then exercises control over the price at which he buys) situation.
        - Infra Inadequate at APMC- when higher moisture -no space for drying- less price to farmer, Fragmented markets, multiple levy of license fees, limited licenses, lacks managerial skill for integration with FPI’s.
        - Area served by APMC very low in Punjab but gigantic in Assam.
        - Inaccesible to farmers due to long travel required.
    - **Other Infra issues**
        - Cold storage less, loading unloading facilities, weighing equipment.
        - Govt- Public expenditure on agricultural marketing sub-sector ranges 4-5 % of the total public expenses on agriculture, while expenditure on marketing infrastructure development has been less than 1 %.
- **Govt Efforts**:
    - APMCs
    - NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE MARKETING FEDERATION OF INDIA LTD (NAFED) - is the apex organization of marketing cooperatives - eg: OPERATION GREENS
    - AGMARKNET - agricultural marketing related information from a single window
    - E-NAM
- **Way Forward**:
    - Agri as an entreprise- ASHOK DALWAI COMMITTEE on doubling farmers income
    - NITI AAYOG strategy @75 - create “agri”prenaurs
    - Adopt “Fork to Farm approach” instead of ‘farm to fork’- understand needs consumers and then produce
    - Large investments are essential for the development of post-harvest and cold-chain infrastructure nearer to the farmers’ field
    - Private sector contribution is needed in this type of investment for which an appropriate regulatory and policy environment is necessary
    - Another important reform is establishing rural godowns to prevent distress sale by the planters, particularly the small and marginal farmers, due to prevailing low prices

### 3 New Farm Laws
- **The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 _[related to APMC]_**
    - **Key features of the Act**
        - Trade of farmers’ produce: The Act allows intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers’ produce outside APMC.
        - Electronic trading: of scheduled farmers’ produce through electronic trading platform (like amazon for agri).
        - Market fee abolished: The Act prohibits state governments from levying any market fee, cess or levy on farmers, traders, and electronic trading platforms for trade of farmers’ produce conducted in an ‘outside trade area’.
    - **Intended benefits of the Act**
        - Reduced role of intermediaries: ending the monopoly exercised by traders and other intermediaries. For example, a turmeric farmer now could sell her produce to BIGBASKET in Delhi, without any mandi tax or trader commission, at a mutually agreed upon price.
        - Integrated Market: Barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade enable farm surplus to move freely from surplus to deficit regions- advance the idea of ‘one Nation, one Agri-market’.
            - Currently, the agricultural markets are very fragmented. For instance, the monthly average price of rice in 2019 ranged from ₹2,042 per quintal in Agra (Uttar Pradesh) to ₹5,102 in Gangtok (Sikkim).
        - Encouraging APMC reforms: Private markets could put pressure on APMC markets (the Act does not repeal the APMC laws) to infuse more transparency and efficiency in their functioning.
            - The State governments have a significant role in reforming the APMC system: depoliticize the committees, compete with pvt market, the cess levied on market transactions can be waived.
    - **Issues with act**
        - Issues with sudden changes in market mechanisms - in 2006, Bihar repealed its APMC Act with an objective to attract private investment - however resulted in
            - Erosion of the existing infrastructure over time due to poor upkeep, farmers facing issues such as high transaction charges and lack of information on prices.
        - The Act creates an artificial distinction between “market areas” (regulated by the mandi system under state governments) and “trade areas” (now under the central Acts), thus risking a problem of dual regulatory market.
            - ‘trade area’ will have no oversight and the government will have no information or intelligence about who the players are, who is transacting with who for what quantities and at what prices.
            - ‘trade areas’ would have a clear regulatory advantage over ‘market areas’ vis-à-vis the mandi tax. This could potentially lead to a collapse of the APMC system and initiatives like e-NAM which are riding on top of physical mandi structure in the country.
        - Federal issues- Leaves a critical institutional space- how state-specific implementation investments, crucial for running efficient markets, will be negotiated and managed, if APMC are bypassed.
            - State Governments will lose mandi tax, which is a major source of revenue for States like Punjab and Haryana.
    - **Counter Arguments**: (by ASHOK GULATI - former chairman CACP)
        - 90% of the produce is sold through private sector, its only wheat rice where MSP has meaning.
        - Case Study: Milk sector (growing 3 times faster than cereals) - Private players like NESTLE, HATSUN, AMUL Co-op; Similarly poultry sector being handled by pvt sector is growing at fast pace.
        - The NSSO’s SITUATION ASSESSMENT SURVEY (70th round) revealed that in 2012-13, only 6 per cent of farmers sold their produce at MSP (still the level is same as per estimates).
        - MSP and APMC system primarily helps those who have large surpluses, mainly the large farmers. So, if one really wants to help the small and marginal farmers, the right approach is through FPOs at the village level and not in APMC mandis [86 per cent of Indian farmers are small and marginal (less than 2 ha), operating roughly 47 per cent of the total operated area in the country].
        - Issues at Bihar is not due to APMCs but lack of governance (25 out of 28 sugar mills are closed due to governance issues).
        - What government needs to do? Price needs to be stabilized during sharp fall in prices (through forming a fund), Need to reduce wheat/rice by giving incentives to other crops where there is deficit.
- **The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 _[related to contract farming]_**
    - **Contract farming** is based on a pre-harvest agreement between buyers (food processors) and producers (indv, farmer groups); Provisions of the Act:
        - Farming agreement between a farmer and a buyer has to be formed prior to the production or rearing of any farm produce.
        - Pricing of farming produce: The price of farming produce should be mentioned in the agreement. A clear reference for any additional information if price subject to variation. Also the process of price determination must also be mentioned in the agreement.
        - Dispute Settlement: Conciliation Board → Sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM) → Appellate Authority (DM/collector/additional collector).
        - Penalty can be imposed but in no case farmer's land be confiscated/attached for recovery.
    - **Intended benefits of the Act**
        - Transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor. Due to prior price determination, farmers will be shielded from the rise and fall of market prices.
        - Provide farmer access to high quality seeds, better technology, fertilizers and pesticides along with impetus to research and new technology.
        - Catalyst to attract private sector & foreign investment for building supply chains.
        - Reduced cost of marketing for farmers: as farmer will not have to seek out traders.
        - Structured framework to CF; Protection to land ownership of farmers.
        - Impetus for research & modern tech in agri sector.
    - **Potential Issues from the Act**
        - Apprehension that Acts would pave the way for dismantling of the MSP system and leave farmers at the "mercy" of big corporates. However, the Government has clarified that these Acts would not have any impact on the MSP mechanism which will continue.
        - The Act, while offering protection to farmers against price exploitation, does not prescribe the mechanism for price fixation or a methodology for regulatory oversight (farmers will be in pressure & will not be able to determine prices).
        - According to the Act, companies are not required to have a written contract with the farmer, making it difficult for farmers to prove terms.
        - District Administration may not be well equipped to settle disputes’ In case of disputes big cos might be at advantage.
- **The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020**
    - **Background**: ECA 1955 discourages traders from investing in warehousing and storage facilities; Did not distinguish b/w greedy hoarders and genuine large firms.
        - ECONOMIC SURVEY 2020 has criticised ECA which is used as a tool to conduct raids being misused for bribes; Stock limits have proved ineffective to still control inflation.
    - ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 Agriculture 15.jpeg]]
    - **Benefits**:
        - Attract private investment in Cold Storage, warehouses and processing.
        - Provide exemption to food processing cos.
        - Remove the vagueness present in ECA 1955.
    - **Issues**:
        - Only Union govt. can impose stock limits (seen as encroachment on cooperative federalism).
        - Fear that the Act would effectively legalize hoarding.
- **Other issues**
    - Violating the federal spirit of the Constitution: since Agriculture is a State subject laws undermines India’s federal consensus.
    - Interfering in state subjects is administratively unwise: Agriculture markets in state list due to the very localized nature of farm production - issues of mandi tax revenue, state unable to nudge agri policies through AMPC act.
    - Not inclusive of farm organizations: No consultations were held with major farm organizations.
- **Overall Way Fwd**
    - Farm laws can be watershed moment for agriculture similar to NEP 1991 reforms. However, just like NEP these will take time to show their result and require the govt to be proactive to step in when needed, as mere changing laws is half the job done. The steps taken by govt. towards 10,000 FPOs and 1 lakh crore Agri Infra Fund are step in the right direction.

#### 2018: Examine the role of supermarkets in supply chain management of fruits, vegetables and food items. How do they eliminate number of intermediaries?
- Define supermarket- self service retail markets conducting farm to fork procurement and selling. Eg RELIANCE FRESH.
    - Fruits and vegetables imp component of them apart from branded food items.
- **Role of Supermarkets in supply chain** (talk wrt various elements of SCM)
    - Increases efficiency by elim of interm and faster logistics.
    - Address demand of perishable products marketing.
    - Direct selling by manufacturer/farmer (horticulture products), eliminate wholsaler- cost efficient for consumers.
    - Role played in transportation of perishable items - they have better resources.
    - Role played in storage/inventory of above items - Increase shelf life of the products.
    - Role played in marketing of produce through branding and grading.
- **Elimination of intermediaries**:
    - Normal Chain: Farmer → Aggregator/Transporter → APMC Mandi → Graders, Brokers, Agents → Wholesaler → Retailer → Consumer
    - Supermarket: Farmer/Agrregators → Supermarket → Consumer
    - procurement from farm gate near urban areas- save from intermediary, tie up with aggregator (like FPO’s) for far away areas.
    - Requires some middlemen though like weighman, graders but most eliminated.

#### 2014: Have APMCs impeded development of agriculture and caused food inflation? Critically examine
- **Food Inflation Trend**: Avg 6.14% b/w 2012-20 (with highest ~14% in 2013 and lowest (-)2.6% in 2018)
- **Reasons why above statement is true**:
    - Linkage b/w APMC trustees and politicians.
    - Wastage of food leading to ⬇ supply and leads to ⬆ inflation.
    - Selling only at APMC leads to higher taxes, higher feees leading to ⬆ inflation.
    - Too many intermediary from farm to fork - share of everyone- inflation.
- **However other reasons are also leading to food inflation/impeding dev of agriculture**
    - Storage, transport issues: Write 1-2 here.
    - MSP has been increased by successive govt. to serve political interests through pre election bonuses.
    - MSP of cereals (rice, wheat) vis a vis non cereal food items- price gap- discouraged production of non-C- inflation.
        - Leads to focus on cereals and cash crops and ignoring pulses, TOP vegetables, etc. (which have less supply, and inflated prices).
- **Positive role played by APMC**
    - Covered above in notes.
    - Also rephrase issues of new farmer law to praise APMC.

#### 2015: Should contract farming and land leasing be promoted in agriculture? Pros and Cons
- **Contract Farming**: Refer for basics and pros → act above
    - **Cons**:
        - Often biased towards the large firms/ large farmers; Unequal bargaining power between farmers and buyers.
        - Informal nature of the contracts may lead to exploitation of farmers.
        - Lead to litigations such as PEPSI-LAYS case.
        - May lead to monopsony.
        - May promotes monoculture → Environmental impacts.
    - **Why MODEL CONTRACT FARMING ACT, 2018?**
        - Before this CF was allowed under MODEL APMC ACT, 2003; APMC play a role in registraion, dispute resolution.
        - NITI AAYOG observed that market fees and other levies are paid to the APMC for contract framing when no services such as market facilities and infrastructure are rendered by them.
- **MODEL LAND LEASING ACT, 2016** - suggested by NITI AAYOG
    - The MODEL LAND LEASING ACT, 2016 seeks to permit and facilitate leasing of agricultural land to improve access to land by the landless and marginal farmers.
    - **Main features of the act**:
        - Legalise land leasing to promote agricultural efficiency.
        - Through this act, the landlord can legally lease the land with mutual consent for agriculture and allied activities.
        - A Leaseholder (tenant) may receive institutional loan, insurance and disaster relief so that he may invest more and more in agriculture.
        - In order to resolve the dispute between the landlord and leaseholder, the provision of “Special Land Tribunal” has been made in the Civil Court.
    - **Pros of Land Leasing**:
        - Lead to farm mechanisation as land will be pooled.
        - Farmer’s income can increase as they can focus on other activities.
        - Enable Land consolidation.
        - Can supplement contract farming.
- **Challenges Associated with the MODEL LAND LEASING ACT, 2016**
    - Absence of tamper-proof land records: Lack of tamper-proof land records with the revenue department - landowners fear leasing out their farms.
    - Lack of Uniformity: Since agriculture is a state subject, the disparity and abundance of laws create confusion- may prevent the formation of a healthy leasing ecosystem.
    - Exploitation of small and marginal farmers: The model Land Leasing Act doesn’t specify the rent on leased land and the period of lease and has rightly left it to the concerned parties in the land lease market which could lead to exploitation of small and marginal farmers.
- **Way forward**:
    - **Measures to land owner**- Ensure no adhoc capturing of land by tenant.
    - **Measures to be taken to protect the interest of small and marginal farmers**
        - 36% of India’s tenant farmers were completely landless, around 86% (of remaining) owned less than two hectare and 56% owned less than one hectare of land. Therefore the small and marginal farmers deserve special attention.
        - The strict restrictions must be removed from the Act so that small and marginal farmers are able to lease land easily without hesitation.
        - Proper awareness and education among the farmers about the benefits that land leasing can bring to their household income and life.
            - They must be taught about the benefits of land leasing and also about the rules and regulations so that they are not fooled by industrialists and large landowners.
        - Farmer activists have strongly advocated that agricultural land must not be used for industrial purposes.
            - Moreover, agricultural land should not be given to corporate houses in the name of poor farmers, should be given to landless, agriculture labourers or unemployed youths at the household level.

#### 2016: Given the vulnerability of Indian agriculture to vagaries of nature, discuss the need for crop insurance and bring out the salient features of the PRADHAN MANTRI FASAL BIMA YOJANA (PMFBY)
- Every year, in one part of India or the other food crops are affected by natural calamities (like flood, drought and plant diseases). The farmers have to be assured that they will be compensated for such loss in crops. Otherwise, they cannot be drawn into the campaign to increase productivity of land under their plough.
- **The need for crop insurance arises for the following reasons**
    - In our country nature has always been moody. Crop insurance provides protection to farmers against losses caused by crop failure and thereby ensures stability in farm income.
    - It also reduces, to some extent, government expenditure incurred on relief measures extended to meet the havoc caused by natural calamities such as droughts and floods, locusts, plant diseases.
    - It also strengthens the position of co-operatives and other institutions that finance, agriculture to the extent it enables the farmer members to repay their loans in years of crop failure.
    - By protecting the economic interest of the farmers against possible risk or loss, it accelerates adoption of new agricultural practices.
    - It may act as anti-inflationary measure, by locking up part of the resources in rural areas.
- The government launched a new crop insurance scheme, PM’s FASAL BIMA YOJANA (PMFBY) with a view to de-risk agriculture from the vagaries of nature.
- **Salient features of PMFBY are following**:
    - Uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all Kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops.
    - In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%.
    - There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. Even if balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the Government.
    - **Revamped clauses of scheme**:
        - Not longer mandatory to buy insurance if taking loans.
        - Burden of states have been increased.
        - Penalise states if there is no pendency in release of funds.
    - **Challenges**
        - Only ~50% applications are settled as per PMFBY portal.
        - The number of farmers’ crop insurance claims that were rejected by insurance companies under PMFBY multiplied 10 times over two year period in FY19-20 (this is due to difference in assessment, delay in filling, denial of claims to non-insured farmers, etc.).
    - **Success**: The scheme has completed four years and has been implemented in 27 states and UNION TERRITORIES. The sum insured has almost doubled under this scheme from Rs 22,000 per hectare to Rs 39,000 per hectare.

### MSP Issues:
- led to import dep for pulses/oil seeds; WTO subsidy tussle (amber **box) due to Trade-distorting**; **WF:** Check on open procurement, **BHAVANTAR BHUGTAN (PDPS laao - NITI),** PM AASHA; MSP based on agro-climatic zones; **SWAMINATHAN COMMITTEE is must in MSP**.

### MSP legalisation:
- **-ve**: Problems like small farms, disguised unemployment, lack of investments and infrastructure are main reasons for agrarian **distress**. MSP doesn’t address these issues; It may result in **evaporation of private sector purchases**; **Inflation due to high procurement cost**; **Increased litigation** and judicial burden.
- **Role of M. S. SWAMINATHAN:**
    - BHARAT RATNA - GREEN REVOLUTION-Genetic research for HYV of crop seeds; **Rice varieties like PUSA BASMATI**; **EVERGREEN REVOLUTION**; Call for 50% above cost for MSP; **Role in PPVFRA 2001 ACT (deals with IPR in** agri); Food fortification; Modern farming methods promoted; Local breeding promoted among farmers.
- **Broad categorisation is needed:** Question is **farm policies** have led to certain undesirable **consequences** → Then analyse on Environmental level, Economy level (subsidy burden, populism, impact on agri-exports), Social (health, micro-nut def, Change in food habits).

#### PACS
- are the grassroot level arms of co-operative credit structure; funded by NABARD via DCCBs/SCBs; 65k+ functional PACS, eg: Provide credit to small farmers via KCC; Used for world’s largest **decentralised grain storage** facilities at PACS level + PACS can **avail interest subvention for constructing** agri-infra.
- There are around **98,995 PACS** with a member base of **13 crore**.

#### Millets
- **Key Points:** **SRI-ANNA**, INT YEAR OF MILLETS, MAHARISHI (G20).
- **Map: RJ 40% prod, UP 20%, HY (~~not MP~~) 12%** (top 3 producers).
- **+ve:** Low glycemic index, **Anti-oxidants**, **Low water footprint**, **Sequester carbon/N2**, nutricereal; **Wondergrain** of the world (by FAO); **Drought/Pest resistant**, **Better income (short cycle, low inv**, mixed farming/dual purpose as fodder).
- **Issues**: Policy to focus on R/W; Social fact (inc PCI, taste pref, poor man’s food); **Lack of processing machinery; Quality seeds**, Limited commercialisation.
- **Wf**: Odisha Millet Mission (best P), Focus on economy of millets (all stages of production, scientific high yield variety); **Beh change (millet mela/fairs); Primary processing facilities**; Inclusion in PDS/MPS/PM-POSHAN (**millet laddoo in Uttrakhand); Create diverse seed banks**.
- Q.16) A link between unorganized farming community and formal industrial sector, Food Processing Industries (FPI) can play a key role in advancing the rural economy. Evaluate.
    - Approach: Introduce the answer by defining food processing **(Food processing is a sunrise sector that engages in value addition to the agricultural products)**. In the body of the answer, discuss the role of FPI in advancing rural economy **(FPI is labour intensive,** 9mn ppl by 2024 ASSOCHAM**; Farmgate infra-grading/sorting; Augmenting income by** **value add-organic jam,** branding/marketing). In the next part, discuss the reasons for underperformance of the food processing sector. Lastly, briefly discuss ways to promote FPIs (you missed these two angles). Conclude _the answer by impressing on how different steps taken by the government can reenergize the FPIs_.

#### Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture
- **Changing Weather Patterns**: Unpredictable weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters, affect crop yields. For example, **prolonged droughts in sub-Saharan Africa reduce agricultural productivity**.
- **Pests and Diseases**: Climate change fosters the spread of pests and diseases, further threatening crops. **Warmer temperatures** can **expand the range of pests like locusts**.
- **Soil Degradation**: Increased carbon dioxide levels and changing rainfall patterns contribute to soil degradation, reducing fertility and agricultural output.
- **Solutions: Agro-ecology techniques** (**crop rotation**, polyculture, **Precision agriculture, and agroforestry**); **Technology** (Drones, sensors, and AI-driven tools); Water mgmt.
- **Conclusion:** Ensuring food security while preserving environmental health is a **complex but achievable goal**, demanding coordinated efforts at local, national, and global levels.

#### Miscellaneous Points:
- **Agriculture & Environment**
    - **Regenerative Agriculture** describes farming and grazing practices that reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter and restoring degraded soil biodiversity. RA not only “does no harm” to the land but actually improves it.
        - The following farming, ranching and land use practices are used to create regenerative food systems and healthy natural ecosystems:
            - **Biochar**: Biochar is charcoal that is produced by pyrolysis of biomass, yet in the absence of oxygen, and is used as a soil ameliorant for both carbon sequestration and soil health benefits. Biochar is a stable solid that is rich in carbon and can endure in soil for thousands of years.
            - **No-till**: No-till farming is a popular practice to improve soil quality and reduce soil erosion. Instead of using a plow to disturb soil before planning, it employs a drill or alternative equipment to grow crops without breaking the ground.
            - **Perennial Crops**: Perennial plants develop longer, more stabilizing roots than annual crops, but they’ve also been shown to be key to sequestering carbon in the soil. Eg: Perennial sunflower - a perennial oil and seedcrop developed through backcrossing genes with wild sunflower; (Perennial rice - currently in the development stage).
            - **Silvopasture**: It is the intentional combination of trees, forage plants and livestock together as an integrated, intensively-managed system.
    - **Permaculture** is an ethical and positive design science, which helps in putting together various elements (plants, animals, technologies, social structures, economics etc) in a thoughtful manner. The aim is to provide for the needs of human beings while working with nature.
        - The monoculture landscape cannot handle variables in conditions, and quickly collapses into a problem rather than being a solution. On the contrary, a permaculturally-designed farm has enough diverse elements that produce very well in general and exceptionally well under variations. Thus, a permaculture farm is more sustainable in the face of climate change.
        - Currently, about 1.4 acres of land is required to sustain one person per year using current systems in India (**Source: FAO**). Using permaculture, this can be vastly reduced, and in many cases, an entire family of four can be sustained on just 1.5 acres.
    - With climate change looming large on the horizon, a fundamental measure to sustain food security is climate-smart agriculture. Challenges remain for wider adoption of climate-adaptive sustainable agriculture practices, new technology and development plans involving large swathes of land cultivated by small and marginal farmers, who constitute about 85 per cent of all farmers, but often lack necessary assets and resources.
        - eg: Impact of locusts that bred in Africa and middle east.
    - **Suggest this as way fwd**: Agriculture needs to tap positive aspects of allelopathy.
    - **Best Practice: Floating Gardens** - Climate smart agriculture production system in Bangladesh.
        - In agriculture, **cover crops** are plants that are planted to cover the soil rather than for the purpose of being harvested. Cover crops manage soil erosion, soil fertility, soil quality, water rentenion, pests, etc; Example --
            - **Red clover** provides many benefits such as fixing nitrogen, protecting soil from erosion, improving soil tilth, competing with weeds, as well as supplying forage needs.
            - **Buckwheat** (kuttu) is the speedy short-season cover crop which suppresses weeds and attracts beneficial insects and pollinators with its abundant blossoms.
    - **GREEN-AG PROJECT** is introducted to reduce emissions from agriculture. It aims to bring at least 104,070 ha of farms under sustainable land and water management and **ensure 49 million Carbon dioxides equivalent sequestered** or reduced (GEF funded).
    - Rather than relying on artificial fertilizer, promoting microbial ways (fungus, bacterias) to improve quality and quantity of crops.
    - Excessinve nutrient run off from agriculture causes eutrophication in marine ecosystem (thus we need to be careful with fertilizers).
- **Other general issues facing agriculture**:
    - Sale of counterfeit seeds which is harmful for env, farmers, tax revenue (eg: sale of illegal HTBT doubled in 2021).
    - ICAR Research shows depleting density of essential nutrients in wheat/rice cultivated today compared to 50 years earlier (thus impacting our fight towards malnutrition).
    - Emissions of CH4 and NO2 are highest from agriculture sources (as per GLOBAL CARBON PROJECT REPORTS).
    - GM contaminated rice sold to EU will hurt overall export prospects.
- **Strength of agriculture**
    - Only sector to show +ve GVA in FY21.
