### Learnings
- **Don’t list multiple examples in one point** - rather use sub-points eg: multiple temple of CHOLAS - divide into Grandeur, Sculptures, etc (same goes for literature) - **more sub = points more marks**
- Points me hi likho (rather than arrows). I,II,III for better presentation
- **Micro-diagrams aane do** (GUPTA- mein NAGARA temple, Coins; ASHOKA mein pillars, stupa)
- **Vocabulary rich rakho terms ki** - MEDHI, ANDA, **Motifs**, scriptures, **inscriptions**, pillars, **Panchayatan** style, **Calligraphy**, Iconography, Cultural integration

10. 2021: Q9. Examine the uniqueness of tribal knowledge system when compared with mainstream knowledge and cultural systems. (Answer in 150 words) 10
    1. Tribal knowledge systems represent **inter-generational wisdom in band societies** passed on to the present times through **centuries of experience and learnings.** While similar characteristics can be seen in evolution of mainstream knowledge and culture, **tribal knowledge systems are unique due to following reasons:**
        1. Tribal societies have **contemporary knowledge of nature** due to continued closeness to forests, flora and fauna. **Mainstream societies** have moved on to **agricultural** basis of society, and their cultural knowledge represents **impressions of their tribal past, which no longer exists.**
        2. While **mainstream knowledge systems** are based on **rigorous refining and questioning** of ideas through discussions and scientific verification, **tribal methods** are based on **conservation of knowledge**. For example, the awareness among **TRIBALS OF ANDAMAN & NICOBAR** about a wall of sea helped them against **TSUNAMI IN 2004.**
        3. Tribal knowledge systems are stored in **songs and stories,** while mainstream knowledge is preserved in **books and recordings.**
        4. Tribal knowledge systems promote **integrated learning** for the community. **In mainstream** society, knowledge and traditions have bifurcated, with **traditions becoming a subject of study instead of mode of studying.**
        5. Tribal knowledge systems are **non-exclusionary** and **marked by equity.** Mainstreams knowledge systems are mired in barriers like **cost of education, patent protections, social exclusion etc.**
    2. Tribal and mainstream societies are **not mutually exclusive systems**. Constant interaction and mutual dependence have enriched both. The way forward should be based on mixture of **mutual learning and preservation** through **salad bowl model instead of assimilation.** Recent initiatives like India’s **TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE DIGITAL LIBRARY** initiative or the NEHRUVIAN model of **TRIBAL PANCHSHEEL** are some other approaches.

## Timeline

## Art and Architecture

### Early Civilisation
- Pre-history- no written records but remains such as pottery,stone tools etc
- Paleolithic (old stone), Mesolithic (Middle stone), Neolithic (New Stone), Metal age (Chalcolithic-copper then iron age)
- Paleolithic- before 10,000 BC, sites near water surface, hunter-gatherer lifestyle, stone tool for hunting, few old stone paintings at **BHIMBETKA**
    - **BHIMBETKA, BELAN VALLEY, GUFKRAL (J&K), SOHAN VALLEY (PJ)**
- Mesolithic- 10,000-6000 BC, rock painting give idea about socio-eco life, **microliths** (small tools found), start settling for long periods in area, **domestication of animals**
    - **ADAMGARH, BAGOHR** (first times domestication of animals)
- Neolithic- 6000-4000 BC, practice of **agri** started (wheat rice barley etc), polishing of stone, pottery making started, mud bricks house instead of grass huts, wool rearing too
    - **MEHARGARH** (first times agriculture)
- Metal age- started with use of copper, bronze around 2000 BC, smelting metal ore, metal crafts (eg INDUS VALLEY -chalcolithic culture)
    - Iron age- megalithic burials- iron weapons found, iron mentioned in VEDAS
- 2015: MESOLITHIC rock cut architecture of India not only reflects the cultural life of the times but also a fine aesthetic sense comparable to modern painting. Critically evaluate this comment. **NCERT**
    1. Cultural life
        1. Shows hunting scenes, with weapon details such as spears, bows, arrows
        2. Depiction of community dances, musical instruments, pregnant women, child rearing by other women, drinking men
    2. Paintings
        1. Use of different colours- handprints, geometric patterns, layers of paitings (comparable to abstract art), stick figures compared to current tribal culture art such as WARLI, basic day to day life also depicted in paintings of city life-market etc, sexual scenes in MESOLTHIC paitings -seen in todays erotic paitings
        2. However modern painting - elevated stuff- great emphasis on minute details, use of uncoventional materials, can covey lot of thoughts at once made as portraits- significant diff from MESOLITHIC
            1. Eg paitings of BHARAT MATA (by **ABANINDRANATH TAGORE)**, MF HUSSAIN, **Lady with a lamp** by RAJA RAVI VERMA
            2. Less focus on nature in modern abstract- compared to past
            3. Classical art depicts what man saw, modern art what man thinks
- 2015: The ancient civilization in Indian sub-continent differed from those of EGYPT, MESOPOTAMIA and GREECE in that its culture and traditions have been preserved without breakdown to the present day. Comment.
    1. While other seen breakdown of past - EGYPT- largely follows ISLAM instead of polythiestic beliefs in past, MESOPOTAMIA- multiple empires- after nation state- scattered etc
    2. While in India lot of continuity
        1. Religious- MOTHER GODDESS, PASHUPATI SHIVA, fire altars, tree worship seen even today, secular nature of IVC- india secular country, **ritual bathing in GANGA similar to GREAT BATH**
        2. Pottery, chesse, game of dice, bangles, jewellery by both men and women- today too
        3. Drainage, weights and measures, GRANARY (use other IVC points given below)
        4. **VARNA SYSTEM**, patriarchy- of later VEDIC seen today
        5. Hunter gather lifestlye coming back in form of bagpacker nomad culture
        6. Wide respect to kings even seen today in post independent india
        7. Traditions were linked to economic activities eg: Harvest festivals - this led to continuity of traditions when these eco activities contd.
        8. Counter also: that modernisation, globalisation leading to changes
- 🧨2020: The rock-cut architecture represents one of the most important sources of our knowledge of early Indian art and history. Discuss.
    - Rock-cut architecture is the **practice of creating a structure**, by carving out of the **solid natural rock** unlike structural architecture
    - The significance of Rock Cut architecture (understand what all to include here): (includes caves, temples, chaityas/viharas, Rock edicts of ASHOKA)
        1. **Society**: The earliest caves employed by humans were **natural caves used by local inhabitant** for a variety of purposes, such as shrines and shelters. MESOLITHIC period (6,000 BCE). The **rock-shelters of BHIMBETKA**, a World Heritage Site
        2. **Religious**: They depict religious values BUDDHIST: **CHAITYA AND VIHARAS**, **AJANTA** caves; HINDU: KAILASANATH TEMPLE at ELLORA, **SHORE TEMPLES & RATHS** at MAHABALIPURAM; **JAINISM: UDAYGIRI AND KHANDAVGIRI** caves; All: ELLORA caves; **AJIVIKA: BARABARA CAVES**
        ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 3.png]]
        3. Art and cultural significance: A period of intense building activities at AJANTA site occurred under the **VAKATAKA KING HARISENA** between 460-478 CE (Caves other than 9, 10, 12 and 13), variety of decorative sculpture, intricately carved columns, and carved reliefs are found
            - #diagram
            ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 6.jpeg]]
            - A rock-cut temple is carved from a large rock-cut to imitate a wooden or masonry temple, with wall decorations, and works of art. Finest example- **KAILASHANĀTH TEMPLE AT ELLORA** (famous as excavated top down)
        - Pillars: **SARNATH PILLAR** (of ASHOKA), **ROCK EDICTS PILLAR 13 OF KALINGA**
        1. **Political History: Caves** were patronized by kings across country **BARBARA CAVES by ASHOKA**, ELLORA , ELEPHANTA CAVES by RASHTRAKUTAS ,**BADAMI by CHALUKYAS**
            1. **International Relation:** Paintings at AJANTA show **reception given to a PERSIAN embassy** by **PULAKESIN II**
        2. Education center: **KANHERI CAVES** were biggest education center in Western India ⭐ (While **KANHERI CAVES** were a significant Buddhist center, calling them the "biggest education center in Western India" might be an overstatement without specific historical backing.)
        3. **BUDDHIST CAVES** on trade routes also used as **centres of economic trade** by traders ⭐ (While Buddhist monasteries often facilitated trade, stating they were "centres of economic trade" might oversimplify their primary religious function.)
        - Thus rock cut architecture across India providing **information about life and times of ancient**Indian people and help us **understand their society through** their lens.

### Indus Valley Civilisation
- 2600-1800 BC (400 yrs after 3KBC ending of Neolithic)
- Origin- Pre HARAPPAN (**MEHRAGARH** in Pak, settled agri life), Early HARAPPAN (large villages and urban culture started- **KOT DIJI**), Mature HARAPPAN (great cities like **MOHENJODARO, KALIBANGAN**), extensive trade Late HARAPPAN (decline of INDUS culture)
![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 7.jpeg]]
- Grid system: Roads were well cut dividing the town into large rectangular blocks. Lamp posts at intervals indicate the existence of street lightning. The citadel of HARAPPAN provides ingredients to the modern day social structure
    - #diagram
    ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 8.jpeg]]
- **Burnt bricks**: Elsewhere in contemporary world, mud-bricks were used. Houses were monotonous - a square courtyard, around which were a number of rooms were built
- **Standardized Brick Size: 4:2:1,** Zoning of residential, commercial, and administrative areas
- Drainage system: The drains connecting from all the houses are connected to a near by central drain. It shows developed sense of health and sanitation.
- **Agriculture: First to produce cotton**. Domesticated sheep, goat, dogs and cats.
- Commerce: Barter system. Weights and measures, **Bead making existed in CHANHADURO**. The **trade of lapis lazuli, cotton** and other **export and import commodities with MESOPOTAMIA**, **SUMERIAN** is origin of modern day commerce. Their **usage of seals** and **stamps** on traded objects to protect them from tampering also shows **present day’s encryption technique** (seals for **trade and education**)
- Arts and crafts: Potter's wheel. **Seal engravings**, especially those with animals. Bronze image of **famous dancing girl, Terracota sculpture**, painted pottery
    - Jewellery by both men and women
- Religious life: No temples are found. Idolatry practised. **PASHUPATI SHIVA, MOTHER GODDESSES** and **PRIEST KING**. PHALLUS (lingam) and YONI worship. **GREAT BATH AT MOHENJODARO**. Trees, stones and animals were worshipped. Overall a secular way of life. Amulets used to shun evil
- Evidence of authority: Uniformity in artefacts -- seals, weights and bricks, Settlements in strategic locations. "**PRIEST KING**" figure, Presence of citadel
- **Importance of water**: The strong belief of **sanctity of water** by HARAPPAN’S **resembles to the belief of south Indians who keep water tank** in temples - cultural input to modern day civilisation
- Use of Carpentry, **pottery**: similarity to modern day use of decoration, amulet, etc - **Red & Black Ware Pottery**
- Burials: Recently discovered **Brick-lined burials** (as opposed to plain pits) in **RAKHIGARHI** were among the most elaborately constructed graves, and possibly implied a high social or ritual status.

#### Content on Dholavira
- **Intro**: IVC time period (2600-1800), Draw map of GJ (mark at KUTCH area), UNESCO World Heritage site
- **Key Features: Town planning** (citadel on hill-diagram, Three parts of town, military garrison; draw comparison with LOTHAL which is 2 layered); **Water conservation system** (dams, reservoirs, 2 seasonal rivers bordering the town), **Stone construction instead of burnt bricks** (fortification, 2 polished stone pillars), **Cementry** (large cementry, stone slabs, 3 types of burials used)
- Conclusion: **DHOLAVIRA** is a model town displaying India’s proto-historic achievements in town planning and engineering
- Conclusion: **LE CORBUSIER** built **CHANDIGARH** - UNESCO Heritage site taking inspiration from IVC or current state of Urbanisation
- Contemporary Indian City Planning: Grid layout, Drainage & sanitation, Zoning, Std Bldg codes, Public utilities (common sanitation facilities)

### Rig-vedic society
1. Family: Foundation of social life was family. Eldest member known as **GRIHAPATI** exercised full authority.
2. Women: **No purdah, No child marriage**, Freedom in choosing their husbands, Re-marraige, family was patriarchal but women were not discriminated.
3. **VARNA SYSTEM**: Divided into four VARNAS. But discriminatory caste system did not exist.
4. Economic life: Pastoralists. **Agriculture was secondary** (later VEDIC had agri as primary; **Here war booty was primary)** occupation, Barter system, **NISHKA COINS**, Anybody can choose any profession.
5. Political life: ARYANS lived in Tribes called **JANA**. **Kingship was not hereditary. King was elected by the members of JANA. Women were part of SABHA**. SABHAS worked on democratic lines. No regular taxation system. Voluntary tributes.
6. Religious life: **NATURAL GODS, INDRA** most popular, no temple, no idol worship

### Later-Vedic society
1. Society: All power is **concentrated in the hands of KSHATRIYAS**. The **centre of gravity was king** not priest
2. Women: Slowly lost their equal position. Not allowed to take part in political life. Excluded from inheriting property. **Practises like SATI, CHILD MARRIAGE, PURDAH SYSTEM** crept into society.
3. **VARNA**: More rigid. More or less hereditary.
4. Economic life: Agriculture became the chief occupation. **Barley, wheat, rice** and few grains and beans began to be cultivated. Trade was practised. Guild system. The **cow as a unit of value was gradually replaced**. Many cities sprung up.
5. Political life: Vast empires and Royal power. **Monarchy and hereditary. Elaborate bureaucracy. Regular army**.
6. Religious life: Rituals became prominent. **Cult of sacrifice**. Towards the end of the period, there was strong resistance against the sacrificial practises and rituals. Many **sects like AJIVIKAS, BUDDHISM, JAINISM, etc arose**.

### Sixth century BCE
1. **MAHAJANAPADAS**: Evolution of **MAHAJANAPADAS** comparable to present day cities was a welcome change given the fact that cities declined with the end of HARAPPAN civilisation. **Cities like MAGADHA, KOSALA were a major centre of trade, arts, craft etc.**
2. Religious ideas: **JAINISM** and **BUDDHISM** evolved as an opposition to the HINDUISM which created a social division in the society. People found a new vent to get out of the clutches of caste oppression.
3. Agricultural developments: Prominent use of **iron ploughs** and implements brought about a overhaul by increasing agricultural production. Construction of **lakes, canals** for irrigation purposes also **increased agricultural productivity.**
4. Literary development: India got its share of rich literature with the **compilation of MAHABHARATA, RAMAYANA, JATAKAS, VEDAS, UPANISHADS**, etc.
5. Currency: Enhancement of trade was ushered in by minting coins made of gold and silver.
6. Specialised craft: The existence of different crafts shows the **specialisation of craft headed by GUILD**. For example, **BUDDHIST** work refers to 18 GUILDS in **RAJAGRIHA** like needle making, gold smithery, carpentry, Ivory etc.
7. Cultural dominance: **GANGETIC VALLEY** originates as a region of cultural dominance in this era.
8. The roots of many common practices that we follow religiously is also the gift of 6th Century India.

### Magadha
1. Of all the kingdoms of north India, **MAGADHA** emerged powerful and prosperous. It became the nerve centre of political activity in north India. **MAGADHA** was endowed by nature with certain geographical and strategic advantages which made her to rise to imperial greatness.
2. These were its strategic position, GANGA and its tributaries provided a means of cheap transport, **MAGADHA** region had a fertile soil, so agriculture was productive, The iron ore in the hills near RAJGIR and copper and iron depositsnear GAYA provided resources for tools and weapons.
3. RAJGIR was surrounded by a group of five hills, and so it was rendered impregnable in those days when there were no easy means of storming citadels such as cannons.
4. Large tracts of forests where Elephants, an important component of the army, were found.
5. Also **MAGADHA** had ruthless and ambitious kings of whom **BIMBISARA, AJATASATRU** and **MAHAPADMA NANDA** are the best known. During the reign of **BIMBISARA** and **AJATASATRU**, the prosperity of **MAGADHA** reached its zenith.

### Jainism and Buddhism
- 2016: Early BUDDHIST STUPA-ART, while depicting folk motifs and narratives successfully expounds BUDDHIST ideals. Elucidate
    - The **MAHAPARINIRVANA SUTRA** claims that after the **BUDDHA** passed away, his followers divided his cremated remains into eight portions. Each of the eight kingdoms in which the **BUDDHA** had lived received one portion of the relics, and a STUPA was erected in each kingdom (Examples **AK-PVR - ALAKAPPA, KAPILVASTU, KUSHINAGAR, PAVA, VAISHALI, RAJGRIHA**, etc)
    - In the next stage, relics of BUDDHAS disciples and companions were similarly enshrined. During 200 BCE to 300 CE, STUPAS- with or without relics became important part of BUDDHIST monasteries.
    - The STUPA represented many things in the BUDDHIST tradition:
        - It stood for the **AXIS MUNDI** (the centre of the universe),believed to be the living presence of the **BUDDHA**, a depository of his protective powers and living energy.
    - The STUPA art expounding BUDDHIST ideals by using folk motifs and narratives:
        - The narrative art of **BHARHUT** and **SANCHI STUPA**, depicting **JATAKAS** of **BUDDHA'S** previous birth in sculptures
        - **Sculputure -** Depicted **BUDDHA** as **empty seat, MANUSHI BUDDHA**, **DHARMA CHAKRA** for sermon
        - The scene of the birth of **BUDDHA** in some STUPAS shows Mother MAYA flanked by two elephants (**GAJA-LAKSHMI MOTIF**)
        - **ANDA**: symbol of latent creative power representing the cycle of death and rebirth. **ANDA** relates to the universe in sometimes called the GARBHA or 'womb'.
        - **HARMIKA**: located at the summit of the **ANDA**, symbolized the zenith beyond life and death (**NIRVANA**)
        - **YASTI**: Rising from the **HARMIKA** was the **YASTI** or pole (that was imagined to run through the **ANDA** into the ground) which represented the **AXIS-MUNDI** (world axis or centre of universe) that connected heaven and earth.
        - **CHATTRAS**: Above the **ANDA**, the **YASTI** serves as a support for **CHATTRAS** (umbrellas) that signify the supremacy of the whole structure. Symbolised the **TRI-RATNA OF BUDDHISM** (in diagram below)
        - **VEDIKA**: Keeping with the ancient tradition of enclosing a sacred tree with a fence, the **CHATTRA** was enclosed by a **RAILING** or **VEDIKA**. The lowest _VEDIKA_ had four entrance gateways or **TORANAS**. The orientation of the **TORANAS** (east, south, west and north) corresponded with the direction of the sun's course: to sunrise, zenith, sunset and nadir.
        - **AYAKA PILLARS**: Five **AYAKA PILLARS** symbolically represents the five main events in **BUDDHA'S** life viz., the birth, the great renunciation, the enlightenment, the first sermon and the final extinction.
        ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 9.jpeg]]#diagram
    - Hence, the early BUDDHIST STUPA art and architecture, though religious in character assimilated the secular folk motifs and narratives for expounding the BUDDHIST ideals.

#### Reasons why Buddhism/Jainism came
1. The **VEDIC RITUALS** were expensive, sacrifices - complicated and meaningless. It confused the people
2. The rigid caste system prevalent in India generated tensions in the society. (**KSHATRIYAS** had resented the domination of the priestly class. **Both BUDDHA and MAHAVIRA belonged to KSHATRIYA caste**)
- The teachings of **UPANISHADS**- highly philosophical- not understood by all
1. The growth of trade - **improvement in the economic conditions of the VAISHYAS**- wanted to enhance their social status but the orthodox **VARNA SYSTEM** did not allow this- began to extend support to **BUDDHISM** and **JAINISM**

#### Causes for the decline of Buddhism
1. The BUDDHISTS **began to adopt SANSKRIT**, the language of the elite. So masses moved away
2. After the birth of **MAHAYANA BUDDHISM**, the **practice of idol worship** and making offerings led to the **deterioration of moral standards**
3. The revival of **BRAHMANISM** and the **rise of BHAGAVATISM**. In **8TH CENTURY AD, ADI SANKARA** greatly cleaned up HINDUISM and brought a very forward outlook. His efforts were assisted by other south Indian gems like **RAMANUJACHARYA, MADHVACHARYA**, etc.
4. **RAJPUT RULERS** were warlike and could not follow the policy of **AHIMSA**. Besides, the Kings of the **GUPTA PERIOD** patronised temples in honour of HINDU gods and goddesses. Thus, the **lack of royal patronage**brought about the decline of **BUDDHISM**.
5. Moreover, the **attack of the HUNS** in 5th and 6th centuries and the Turkish invaders in 12th century **destroyed** the **monasteries**.
6. **BUDDHISM was mainly an urban religion** with the rural India always HINDU. When **ISLAM** came to India, it impacted the urban regions first and thus **BUDDHISM** became the first victim.

#### Contribution of Buddhism
1. The **concept of AHIMSA was its chief contribution**. Later, it became one of the cherished values of our nation.
2. It had also promoted the spread of Indian culture to other parts of Asia.
3. **Religious revolution**- **Simplicity of his teaching** of truth connected with masses Explanation of sufferings through **4 SIMPLE NOBLE TRUTHS (v/s THREE JEWELS in JAINISM)** and the the wheel of DHAMMA was **understandable by ordinary people unlike the scriptures** interpreted by priests only.
    1. Focus was on ethical living rather than rituals, animal sacrifices, etc. Authority of VEDAS was challenged. Faith was given rational basis.
    2. It preached atheism that is, there is no God that will help us in MOKSHA but we ourselves are the makers of our destiny.
    3. **BUDDHISM does not focus on gods or deities** - While some BUDDHIST traditions incorporate deities, they are not central to achieving liberation
4. **Social revolution**- It **opposed CASTE and VARNA SYSTEM**, any form of hierarchy and discrimination
    1. Women were given equal status as men which was against the SHASTRAS like **MANUSMRITI** (social code).
    2. Use of **PALI LANGUAGE** as opposed to SANSKRIT which could be read only by Priests, **broke the monopoly over knowledge**.
    3. Emphasis on **AHIMSA**, avoidance of extremes led to establishment of peaceful society.
    4. Tried to **narrow gap** between rich and poor by advocating its followers **not to accumulate wealth**.
5. Its **contribution to the art and architecture** of India.- The **STUPAS** at **SANCHI, BHARHUT** and **GAYA**, CHAITYAS and VIHARAS in different parts of India.
6. It promoted **education through residential universities** like those at **TAXILA, NALANDA** and **VIKRAMASILA**.
7. Economic- VEDIC practice of killing cattle indiscriminately in sacrifices stood in progress of new agriculture.
    ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 10.jpeg]]**DHARMASUTRAS forbade money lending** on interest which was widely practised by **VAISHYAS**

#### Ashoka’s Contribution in spread of Buddhism
1. Cultural Contribution: **ASHOKA** sent **MAHENDRA**, BUDDHIST monks and missionaries on expedition to countries like **SRI LANKA, LAOS, CAMBODIA, MYANMAR, CHINA, JAPAN** etc. Along with teachings of **BUDDHA**, they have made critical contribution to unfurl BUDDHIST festivals, cuisine, societal values etc. and specifically concept of **NIRVANA**.
2. Architectural contribution: **ASHOKA** built STUPAS (best ex- SANCHI and 9 STUPAS-**AKPVR**), VIHARAS, CHAITYAS, pillars, capitals and also expand the process of inscription writing on rock edicts. eg: **BODH GAYA TEMPLE** was started by **ASHOKA**
    - **ALAKAPPA, KAPILVASTU, KUSHINAGAR, PAVA, VAISHALI, RAJGRIHA**, etc
3. Musical Contribution: Musical chanting most often in SANSKRIT and TIBET (now INTNAGIBLE HERITAGE) are integral part of BUDDHISM. BUDDHIST music prominently includes HONKYOKU, BUDDHIST chant.
4. **ASHOKA** **used local languages** and scripts (**PALI**) on inscriptions to make them easily understandable for common man and for cultural contact.
5. Helped to develop **MAHAVIHARAS** such as **TAXILA**.
- **DHAMMA GOSH** rather than **BERI GHOSA**

#### Others contributors to Buddhism
1. Post MAURYAN- **MENANDER (MILINDA)**- BACTRIAN GREEK who invaded India- patronised BUDDHISM, dialogue with **NAGASENA**
2. **KUSHANS**- **KANISHKA**- embraced BUDDHISM- **MAHAYANA BUDDHISM** came during his time (during 4th council by him), patronised **ASHVAGHOSA** (author of **BUDDHACHARITA**), **GANDHARA 3 MATHURA** imp cities of art during his time
3. **GUPTA**- **KUMARAGUPTA**- founder of **NALANDA UNIVERSITY** + **BAGH BUDDHIST PAINTINGS**
4. **HARSHA**- erected STUPAS and MONASTRIES (one at NALANDA) all over his kingdom, **KANUAJ ASSEMBLY** to honour **HUIEN TSANG**, **patronised NALANDA** uni by donation- int reputation during his reign
5. Foreign rulers- **SAILENDRA RULERS** of INDONESIA- **BOROBUDR MONUMENT AT JAVA**- most wonderful B STUPA in world

### Mauryan art and architecture (Caves, Pillars, Rock Edicts, Stupas)
1. Before **ASHOKA** the tradition largely consisted of working in wood and clay. India has the brick ruins of **MOHENJODARO**. Buildings of VEDIC and BUDDHIST era were of wood. Before **ASHOKA** wooden pillars were regularly erected.
2. **ASHOKA** is known to have built 84,000 STUPAS to commemorate various events of **BUDDHA’S** life. **SANCHI STUPA** best example. According to **MEGASTHENES, PATALIPUTRA’S** grandeur matched that of the cities of PERSIA
3. **ASHOKAN** edicts were **inscribed on stone pillars** that were made of single columns of polished **sandstone** and **had capitals on their top**. The best preserved of all **ASHOKAN** edicts stands at **CHAMPARAN BIHAR**. The most famous capital is the one at **SARNATH, which shows four lions** and the **DHARMACHAKRA; RAMPURVA** had **BULL**
4. Besides pillars- **YAKSHI FROM DIDARGANJ**. The beauty of these figures lies in the exactness of their workmanship
5. Rock cut caves: The **LOMAS RISHI AND THE SUDAMA CAVES** - These caves cut from solid rock were provided **by ASHOKA for AJIVIKA SECT**. These caves **marked the beginning of the rock cut architecture** which was patronised by later rulers too.
6. His stone and **rock cut edicts** (14 major and other minor, **NO.13- WAR WITH KALINGA)** inscribed in **PALI, PRAKRIT** and in **KHAROSHTI** and **BRAHMI SCRIPT**. eg: **SOHAGURA COPPER INSCRIPTION, STONE POTRAIT AT KANAGANAHALLI.**

#### Emperor Ashoka, who ruled the Mauryan Empire from 268 to 232 BCE
#### Changes after Kalinga War
1. Referred to as **PIYADASI**
2. Admin side: Decentralisation and local governance promoted; **DHAMMA PILLARS & EDICTS** made; Promotion of public welfare - roads, rest houses, hospitals, and wells
3. Military Strength: Reduced aggression; Reorganised military (military exp to dev of infra); **Strategic defensive posture (for defence from external threats); Disciplined army (**tribals were disciplined, **war for DHAMMA);**

#### Economic and social conditions during Mauryan period
- **Royal incentives for industries**. Industrial arts and crafts proliferated as a result of swift communication through a network of goods and long roads.
- **Employment of slaves** in agricultural operations.
- **Formation of SHRENIS AND GUILDS**. They provided training, raw materials, and distributed product to merchants. They were provided with high autonomy because of their high importance in urban economy.

#### Achaemenid (Persia) rule and influence
- Administrative structure of the MAURYAN empire was influenced in some measure by that of the **ACHAEMENID (PERSIA)** rulers of PERSIA. The cultural effects of the contacts with the PERSIANS were also significant. The PERSIAN influence may also be traced in the preamble of **ASHOKAN** edicts.
- The PERSIAN scribes brought into India a new style of writing called **KHAROSTHI**. It was derived from the ARAMAIC script, which was written from right to left. Many of **ASHOKA’S** inscriptions found in north western India are written in **KHAROSTHI**.
- The MAURYAN art and architecture were also greatly influenced by the PERSIAN art. The monolithic pillar edicts of **ASOKA** are somewhat like the victory pillars of the **ACHAEMENID** empire.

#### Archimedean (aka Persia) vs Asokhan pillars
1. The shaft of **ASOKAN** pillars is monolithic whereas the **ARCHIMEDEAN** pillars have joints.
2. **ASOKAN** pillars are erected without any support base whereas **ARCHIMEDEAN** pillars have a support base.
3. The **bell shaped part of ASOKAN pillars is at top** while that in **ARCHIMEDEAN pillars is at bottom**. However bell shaped part of **ASOKAN** pillars is an inverted lotus.
    - #diagram
    ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 11.jpeg]]
4. The **ASOKAN** pillars were not a part of any other structure. The purpose behind their construction was to engrave instructions. But **ARCHIMIDEAN** pillars were part of the **PALACE** and their job was to **support** the roof.
5. The **ASOKAN** pillars have capitals which have sculptures of lions, elephants and bulls. But the **ARCHIMIDEAN** pillars have no capitals and only images of humans are engraved on their shafts.

#### Alexander(Macedonian/Greek) and his influence - **INDO-GREEK ART & ARCHITECTURE HAS ITS ORIGIN IN ALEXANDER INVASION**
1. **ACHAEMENID** empire was finally destroyed by the GREEKS under **ALEXANDER**. **ALEXANDER** came to North west India and did not come beyond it because his soldiers feared armies of **NANDA’S** of **MAGADHA**. Though the contact between the MACEDONIANS (GREEK) and ancient Indians was for a brief period, its impact was fairly wide in range.
2. **ALEXANDER’S** invasion brought EUROPE in close contact with India, as sea and land routes were opened between India and the West. A close commercial relation was also established. The traders and craftsmen used to follow these routes.
3. **ALEXANDER’S** invasion paved the way for political unification of north western India by conquering the warring tribes of this region.
4. The influence of GREEK art is found in the **GANDHARA SCHOOL OF ART**.
- Indians also learnt the art of making gold and silver coins from the GREEKS.
1. Many ideas and notions of Indian philosophy and religion which filtered into the ROMAN empire flowed through the channel opened by **ALEXANDER**.
2. Much valuable information about the social and economic condition of north western India can be known from GREEK accounts left by **MEGASTHENES**. Ex: Crafts were developed, trade with outside world.

### Caves

#### Evolution of Buddhist Cave Architecture
1. Phase-1: It **began with the construction of LOMAS RISHI AND SUDAMA CAVES in BARABAR HILLS by ASHOKA**. These were simple caves.
2. Phase-2: The **second stage (100 BC) showed up at KONDIVITE**- contained a STUPA and a circumambulatory path around it (**QUADRANGULAR FLAT ROOF**)
3. Phase-3: The next stage was when **rows of pillars were built parallel to the walls** creating a circumbulatory passage right after entering eg: **KALRA, AJANTA, BHAJA, PITALKHORA**
4. Phase-4: **During the SATAVAHANA time, caves got royal patronage** and became more elaborate and ornamented. Multi-storied caves came up- **TRIPLE STORIED VIHARA AT ELLORA**. Other examples are **NASIK CAVES, KANHERI CAVES**.
    - #diagram
    ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 12.jpeg]]

#### Jaina Caves vs Buddhist Caves
1. **JAINA** caves were cut in sandstone which is easy to cut but not good for sculpting. But **BUDDHIST** caves were cut into hard rocks and were better for sculpting.
2. The **JAINA** caves had no congregation halls or rock cut shrines. The **BUDDHIST** caves on the other hand had clear halls and the shrine area.
3. The **JAINA** caves were simple and reflected the asceticism of **JAINA** monks. The **BUDDHIST** caves on the other hand were an elaborate and **spacious affair.**
4. In terms of similarities, the sculptures use similar motifs like animals, plants. Examples of **JAIN** caves are **KHANDGIRI AND UDAIGIRI** in ORISSA, **MANGI TUNGI CAVES OF MH**

#### Types of Jain Architecture
1. **Caves** (covered above): **ELLORA, SITTANAVASAL CAVE**
2. **Statues: BAHUBALI STATUE**- **SHRAVANABELAGOLA**, **STATUE OF AHIMSA (RISHABNATHA)- MANGI-TUNGI HILLS**
3. **JIANALAYA (Temple): DILWARA** Temple- **MOUNT ABU, RAJASTHAN**; **GIRNAR TEMPLE**- **GUJARAT**; **GHANTAI TEMPLE OF KHAJURAO**
- **JAINA STUPA** is also found in **MATHURA** which is called **DEVANIRMIT STUPA**.
- The ascetic nature of these religions inclined their followers to live in natural caves and grottos in the hillsides, away from the cities.

### Shunga Dynasty
- Began from circa 185–73 BCE
- Decline of the MAURYAN EMPIRE led to the rise of regional powers, including the **SHUNGA DYNASTY**
- Revival of **BRAHMANISM**; HINDU Iconography (deities and motifs); Influence of BUDDHISM remained (elaborated STUPAS with **BUDDHA’S** narrative reliefs); Architecture (**SHUNGA STUPAS** eg: **SANCHI** had carved **TORANAS**, built prayer halls CHAITYAS and dwellings VIHARAS); **Used location material and techniques** for diversity (**See how generic content is written**)

### Stupas
1. The STUPA originated as a simple semi circular mound of earth, later called **ANDA**. Gradually, it evolved into a more complex structure, balancing round and square shapes.
2. Above the **ANDA** was the **HARMIKA**, a balcony like structure that represented the abode of the gods. Arising from the **HARMIKA** was a mast called the **YASHTI**, often surmounted by a **CHHATRI** or umbrella. Around the mound was a railing, separating the sacred space from the secular world.
3. The **early STUPAS at SANCHI and BHARHUT were plain except for the stone railings, gateways**-which were richly carved and installed at the four cardinal points; **YASTI** had 3 rings
4. The **new STUPAS had a 2 circumambulatory path** with stone railing, **two staircases leading** up to it, **TORAN DWARS** on all four sides. Sculpture decoration was found on the railings and the gateways. Examples are the STUPAS at **SANCHI-II, NAGARJUNKONDA, AMRAVATI**, etc.; **YASTI** had 5/7 rings
    - #diagram
    ![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 13.jpeg]]
5. **DHARMACHAKRA** at centre of STUPA resembles **BUDDHA’S** first sermon
6. In AP STUPAS- 5 free standing pillars were erected. These represent the 5 important events in **BUDDHA’S** life birth, renunciation, enlightenment, first sermon, death
    1. Why did **SANCHI** survive while **AMARAVATI** did not- **AMARAVATI** was discovered before scholars understood the value of the finds. In British times- practice of collecting ancient sculptures ex-situ by removing them from archaeological sites like **AMARAVATI**. Request of Europeans to take away the eastern Gateway of **SANCHI** was refused by **SHAH-JEHAN BEGUM**. She even provided money for preservation. No such ruler existed for **AMARAVATI**.
7. The **AJANTA CAVES IN MAHARASHTRA, a World Heritage Site**, are **30 rock- cut cave BUDDHIST temples** carved into the sheer vertical side of a gorge near a waterfall fed pool located in the hills of the SAHYADRI mountains. Like all the locations of BUDDHIST caves, this one is located near main trade routes and spans six centuries beginning in the 2nd or 1st century BC.

### Satavahanas
1. They were successors of the MAURYAS in DECCAN and the CENTRAL INDIA.Most important king was **GAUTAMIPUTRA SATAKARNI** (AD 106-130) who raised the power and prestige of **SATAVAHANAS** to great heights.
- Issued lead coins.

#### Social conditions during Satavahana time
1. The **SATAVAHANA** society was divided into four classes. This division was based on economic activity and status. **Women were honoured**. They were given higher education and they took part in religious functions. Some of the rulers even **added their mother’s name** to their own name, such as **GAUTAMIPUTRA SATAKARNI**
2. The **SATAVAHANAS** were **BRAHMANAS**. Therefore, **BRAHMANISM** made rapid strides under their rule. The **BRAHMANAS** were accorded the highest place. Effort was also made to revive the **VARNA SYSTEM**.
- However they also constructed BUDDHIST **CHAITYA** and **VIHARAS** eg: **SANCHI II** + **AMRAVATI** is other type - where only panel sculpture - by **SATVAHANAS & IKSHVAKU**
1. Inter marriages among the HINDUS and foreign tribes of the **SAKAS**, the **PARTHIANS** and the **GREEKS** were freely consummated so that these foreigners were absorbed forever in the HINDU social order.

### Gandhara school of Art
- Around PESHAVAR during 1st-2nd C AD
- It is between the 2nd and 5th century CE that **GANDHARA ART** and the Art of **MATHURA** came into existence as their separate identity. While the early BUDDHIST artists used symbols to represent the presence of the **BUDDHA**, **beginning with the KUSHANA rule, the BUDDHA was represented in human form**. Both **GANDHARA** and **MATHURA ART** schools reached their peak during **KANISHKA**
- **Originated during INDO-GREEK (BACTRIAN) RULERS but real patron were KUSHANAS (**MATHURA** and **GANDHARA** **both** by **KUSHANA**) esp **KANISHKA**
- Blend of Indian and GRECO-ROMAN elements
- **KANISHKA** made STUPAS in GRECO-ROMAN architectural style- many ruins **found in PESHAWAR, RAWALPINDI**
- Features of **GANDHARA ART**: Spiritual **BUDDHA** Sad **BUDDHA** Bearded **BUDDHA** Less ornamentation Great detailing **BUDDHA** in YOGI postures GREEK factors like wavy hair, large forehead, long ears; Grey sandstone
    - Moulding human body in realstic manner with minute attention to physical features like Moustache,muscles, curly hair
    - Thick drapery with large and bold lines
    - less carving, less ornamentation and symbolic expressions.
    - Played major role in evolution of **BUDDHA** image in **MAHAYANA BUDDHISM**
- 2019: Highlight the Central Asian and GRECO-BACTRIAN elements in GANDARA art; 2014- GANDHARA sculpture owed as much to ROMANS as to the GREEKS. Explain
    - **GANDHARA** called **GRECO-BUDDHIST ART**- in areas of AFG, NW- closely associated with **MAHAYANA B**
    - Map: BACTRIAN, INDO GREEK in NW India; Then became GRECO-BACTRIAN → How it came to India? Invasion of **ALEXANDER** during **NANDAS**
    - **Region on crossroads** many cultural influnces as in the vicinity of ancient **SILK ROUTE**
    - Patronised by **KUSHANA** ruler
    - Central asian elements
        - **Disc shaped halo** around **BUDDHA** similar to PERSIAN culture of reverence of sun
        - **KHAROSTI SCRIPT** on BUDDHIST inscriptions
        - Long overcoats, Sword & scabbard (not in ROMAN)
        - Figures with **conical and pointed caps** on their heads resemble the SCYTHIAN caps of similar design
        - The regular depiction of fire worship in the **GANDHARA ART**, a trait which was probably derived from IRANIAN sources
    - GRECO-BACTRIAN elements
        - **Wavy hair, moustche**, **third eye/dot** btw eyebrows, symbolic expression such as of calmness
        - Grace and sharp physical attributes were inspired from GREEK gods such as **APOLLO, ZEUS**
        - Muscular formation of body on lines of **HERCULES** and **ATLAS**
    - ROMAN elements (majorly influeced by GREEK but ROMAN impact on GANDHARA quite noticiable)
        - Large forehead, large earlobe, broad chest & shoulders similar to GLADIATORS, Tall sculptures
        - Standing **BUDDHA** similar to ROMAN emperor statues
        - The **GANDHARA** school drew upon the anthropomorphic traditions of ROMAN religion and represented the **BUDDHA** with a youthful APOLLO-like face, dressed in garments resembling those seen on ROMAN imperial statues. Its significance lies in the fact that until then **BUDDHA** was not represented in a human-like figure.
            - History- (GREECE ruled under ROMAN EMPIRE)

### Mathura school of art
1. **MATHURA** (imp city under **KANISHKA**) School of art (1st C AD) developed during post MAURYA period and reached its peak during the **GUPTAS** It is known for its assimilative and indigenous character and is known for earliest Indian representations of the **BUDDHA**.
2. In its **early phase, BUDDHA was depicted as symbol of either two footprints or wheel. Later**, **BUDDHA** images represented in human form.
3. In **MATHURA, more stress** is given to the inner beauty and **facial emotions** rather than bodily gesture or realistic human body representation. The **halo around the head of BUDDHA was profusely decorated** unlike the **GANDHARA ART** form.
    1. **Cheat code:** **GANDHARA ART** has **spiritual image** (wavy hair, unshaven face, half closed eyes, veins & muscles visible) whereas **MATHURA ART** **has delighted image** (extensive clothes, round body, ornamentation; red sandstone)
    - **Halo** is used in **GANDHARA** unlike **MATHURA** (from IRANIAN Influence); Depicted here as god/divine vs more as a king in **MATHURA**
4. Also, since the development of **MATHURA** art took place indigenously, wherein it used locally available spotted red sandstone and **BUDDHA** images were modelled on the lines of earlier **YAKSHA IMAGES, Also images of SHIVLINGAS, PARVATI, VISHNU WITH AYUDH, YAKSHINIS, JAIN TIRTHANKARS were made (so not just BUDDHIST)**
5. **MATHURA** during the **KUSHANA** rule, came under the influence of **GANDHARA SCHOOL**. With the increased demand of **GANDHARA BUDDHA**, some **MATHURA** sculptures too incorporated many HELLENISTIC (relating to GREEK history) elements Ex: **SARVATOBHADRIKA IMAGE OF 4 JAINA’S** standing back to back, **STANDING BUDDHAS OF THE SARNATH** and **KAUSAMBHI**.
    1. The first **MATHURA** image makers never intended to sculpt an anatomically correct human **BUDDHA**. Later, the human **BUDDHA** images evolved
6. Thus, **MATHURA** and **GANDHARA** art cross fertilised, and the bulky **MATHURA BUDDHA** gradually gave way to the slender elegance of the **GANDHARA** image. The result of this synthesis refined and purified the **BUDDHA** image that appeared in the **GUPTA PERIOD**, which later became the model for Southeast Asian **BUDDHA** images

### Mathura vs Sarnath vs Amravati School of art
1. In north India, **MATHURA**, remained the main art production site whereas **SARNATH** and **KOSAMBI** also emerged as important centres of art production.
2. **AMRAVATI** is other type - where **only panel sculpture** - by **SATVAHANAS & IKSHVAKU**
3. **BUDDHA** images in **SARNATH** have-transparent drapery covering both shoulders, and the halo around the head has very little ornamentation whereas the **MATHURA** images continue to depict folds of the drapery in the **BUDDHA** images and the halo around the head is profusely decorated
    1. Below is **SARNATH STYLE - Mixture of AMRAVATI and MATHURA style** - Pink colour buff stone

### Gupta Age
The **GUPTA PERIOD** witnessed a tremendous progress in the field of art, science and literature and on account of this it has been **called a GOLDEN AGE**. A few scholars even call this period a period of **RENAISSANCE**. The cultural progress witnessed during the **GUPTA PERIOD** may be called the culmination of Indian intellectual activities. Following were the areas of achievements: **SF:** LAMP - SSC

#### Literature
- The SANSKRIT language became prominent during the **GUPTA PERIOD**. Poetry and drama flourished at the court of **CG II**, at his new capital of **UJJAIN** who kept the **NINE GEMS**, at his court
    - Love stories: **MEGHDOOTAM, ABHIGYANA SHAKUNTALAM, VIKRAMORVASHI** were by **KALIDASA. MRICCHAKATIKA** (sattire on society; Love affair) by **SHUDRAKA**
    - Erotic literature: **KAMASUTRA** by **VATSYAYANA**
    - Inspiring literature: **PANCHATANTRA KATHAS** by **VISHNU SHARMA**
    - **Religious** literature: **PURANAS, THE MAHABHARATA** and the **MANUSMRITI** were recast in their present form in the **GUPTA PERIOD**. Other books such as **RAGHUVAMSAM, KIRITARJUNIYAM**
    - **Buddhism**: In addition to these the important BUDDHIST books **DIPAVAMSA** and **MAHAVAMSA** were also compiled in the **GUPTA AGE**; **BUDDHIST LEXICON** named **AMARAKOSA** was compiled by **AMARSIMHA**
    - Development of **KAVYA STYLE**. SANSKRIT now as a secular literature.
    - SANSKRIT grammar based on **PANINI (wrote ASHTADHYAYI)** and **PATANJALI** (wrote **MAHABHASYA**) was developed

#### Architecture
- **Both the NAGARA and DRAVIDIAN STYLES** of art evolved during this period. eg: **TEMPLE AT DEOGARH JHANSI, VISHNU** reclining on the serpent **SHESHA (ANANTA), DASHAVATARA TEMPLE** 5th century, **NALANDA UNIVERSITY**,
- **Initial sculputures of SHIVA at ELEPHANTA CAVES** (Climax of cave making) - **Main linkage to RASHTRAKUTAS**

#### Metallurgy
- Craftsmen were efficient in the art of casting metal statues and pillars. Eg: **DELHI IRON PILLAR**, Copper stautes of **BUDDHA** found at **SULTANGANJ**

#### Paintings
- **PADMAPANI PAINTINGS** at **AJANTA** paintings and **PAINTINGS AT BAGH** belong to this time. They illustrate the life of the **BUDDHA** as depicted in the **JATAKA** stories. The paintings at **SIGIRIYA** in **SRI LANKA** were highly influenced by the **AJANTHA** style

#### Sculpture
- **GUPTA** art is an outcome of the earlier arts of **AMRAVATI, MATHURA** and **BHAHRUT**, although completely different in its own way. The **focus now moved to the female figure**, making **human as a pivot of GUPTA SCULPTURE**. Eg: **relief of GODDESS GANGA** from **BESANAGAR**, seated **BUDDHA** from **SARNATH**, standing statue of **SAKYAMUNI** (another name for **BUDDHA**)

#### Science & Tech
- **GUPTA PERIOD** witnessed a brilliant activity in the sphere of **MATHEMATICS (DECIMAL PLACE VALUE SYSTEM by ARYABHATTA**; while **BRAHMAGUPTA** gave rules for **ZERO**); **ASTRONOMY (VARAHA MIHIR & ARYABHATTA** explained earth as sphere, occurence of eclipses, HELIOCENTRICISM), **ASTROLOGY** and **MEDICINE** (transplantation of internal organs was known as per book **SUSHRUTA (SURGEON) SAMHITA** which was sponsored by **CG II**)

#### Coinage
- **SAMUDRAGUPTA** issued eight types of gold coins. The figures inscribed on them are illustrative of the skill and greatness of **GUPTA NUMISMATIC ART**. **SAMUDRAGUPTA** is represented on his coins playing the lute (**VEENA**). **SILVER COINS** was called '**RUPAYAKA**' (**RUPIAH** by **SHER SHAH SURI**)

#### Social conditions
- **BRAHMANISM SUPREMACY** continued and caste system became rigid. Religious functionaries were granted land called **AGRAHARA**, free of taxes for ever.
- **Though women were idolised (ie. concept of TRI-DEVI** came up) in literature, **MOTHER GODDESS** were worshipped, **they were accorded lower position**. **GUPTA ERA** saw **CHILD-MARRAIGES, DENIAL OF EDUCATION, PRACTICE OF SATI (evidence from ERAN IN MP)**, proliferation of **PROSTITUTION**, objectification of women
- According to **FAHIEN**, Religion was **BRAHMAISM** in GANGETIC VALLEY while BUDDHISM in north west areas. **BUDDHIST** feelings were accommodated eg: **SAMUDRAGUPTA** patronised and **allowed SRI LANKAN KING MEGHAVARMAN** to build monastery at **BODH GAYA**
- Number of untouchables (**NIRVASITA SHUDRAS**) and out-castes increased.
- Plight of **CHANDALA** is highlighted by **FA-HIEN**

#### Gupta administration
- **GUPTA** kings adopted pompous titles such as '**PARAMESHWAR**', '**MAHARAJADHIRAJA**', which signify they ruled over lesser kings in their empire. Element of divinity in kingship was present.
- Council of ministers existed. The empire was divided into '**BHUKTI**' (province) placed under the charge of an '**UPARIKA**' (viceroy), **BHUKTIS** were divided into districts, placed under the charge of '**VISHYAPATI**'. The sub-districts were called '**PETH**' and the village was under '**GRAMIKA**'.
- **GUPTAS** did not maintain vast bureaucracy like that of MAURYAS. **KUMARAMATYAS** were most important officers in Provinces.
- A large part of the empire was administered by feudatories (**aka SAMANTAS**) Fiscal and administrative concessions to priests and administrators.
- Civil and criminal laws were clearly demarcated. Road were safe for all
- Land revenue was fixed at 1/6th rate but was relaxed during famines and increased during wars
- **BRAHMAN** supremacy continued. Religious functionaries were granted land called **AGRAHARA**, free of taxes for ever. They were authorised to collect taxes in those lands
- 2014: **TAXILA UNIVERSITY** was one of the oldest universities of the world with which were associated a number of renowned learned personalities of different disciplines. Its strategic location caused its fame to flourish, but unlike **NALANDA**, it is not considered as a university in the modern sense. Discuss.
    - **BIHAR-NALANDA**- est by **KUMARGUPTA** but prominence under **HARSHA** and **PALA** kings, famous scholars- **ARYABHATTA**, **HUAN TSANG** and **I-TSING** spend time here, major centre for **MAHAYANA** but other schools taught too
    - **NW-TAXILA UNIVERSITY** had been associated with renowned scholars belonging to different disciplines like **CHANAKYA** (wrote – **ARTHASHASTRA** in **TAXILA** itself), **PANINI** (Book: **ASTADHYAYI**; language & grammar), **CHARVAKA** (AYURVEDA, herbal meds) etc, its strategic location at the crossroads of major trade routes i.e, **UTTARAPATH** (connected **GANDHARA** in the west to **MAGADHA** in the East); The **SINDH ROUTE** from KASHMIR to CENTRAL ASIA caused its fame to flourish.
    - However, despite of the above **NALANDA UNIVERSITY** is regarded as a university in the modern sense due to following reasons
        - Subjects /Curriculum – **TAXILA** primarily an imp centre of HINDU and BUDDHIST learning with focusing on teaching of VEDIC literature and art skills like archery and hunting . Whereas **NALANDA UNIVERSITY** taught more secular subjects like Economics, Politics Astronomy, Mathematics, Science, etc.
        - Students – **NALANDA UNIVERSITY** strong BUDDHIST curriculum attracted large no. of students from outside India like KOREA, TURKEY, MONGOLIA, TIBET, JAPAN ,etc enabling cross-cultural intellectual discourse . Whereas, **TAXILA UNIVERSITY** had mostly students from Indian JANPADAS and adjoining areas.
        - Infrastructure – **NALANDA**- multiple classrooms, extensive library , accomodation for students and teachers, etc Whereas, **TAXILA** – most of the learning was given by teachers at their houses privately.
        - System of Education - **NALANDA** – formal and centralised system of education. Teachers at **TAXILA** taught according to their perspective and in the process forming their own schools of learning. **NALANDA** had formal degrees at the end of the course in unlike **TAXILA**.
        - Both **TAXILA** and **NALANDA** were great centres of learning of their times which had a profound impact on Indian culture and knowledge. Also, recently **NALANDA UNIVERSITY** has opened up after 800 years is testimony to the fact that its importance in education and culture is immense.

## Temple Architecture (with other dynasties)
1. The **temple building architecture reflects a synthesis of arts, ideals of DHARMA, beliefs**, values and the way of life cherished under HINDUISM.
2. **NAGARA, DRAVIDA, VESARA**, etc., are different styles of temple architecture. **PALLAVAS** (7th century-9th century) and **CHOLAS** (9th century-11th century) were the major kingdoms which epitomized the **DRAVIDIAN** architecture. **CHALUKYAS** (7th century-11th century) followed **VESARA** style of architecture in the KARNATAKA region. **CHALUKYA** art was followed by **HOYSALA** art (13th century).

### Nagara Style
- North Indian temples. The **NAGARA STYLE HAS ITS ORIGIN** in the structural temples of the **GUPTA PERIOD**, especially the **DASHAVTARA TEMPLE OF DEOGARH**.The **LINGARAJ TEMPLE**, dating from the 11th century, is one of the **grandest and is regarded as a gem of NAGARA** architectural style.
- The plan is square, exhibits a curving **SHIKHARA**. Earliest temples had only one **SHIKHARA**, but in the later periods multiple **SHIKHARAS** came.
- The entire temple is built on a stone platform (named **JAGATI**) with steps leading up to it.
- The **GARBHAGRIHA** is located directly **under the tallest tower**.

### Dravidian Style
1. **DRAVIDA** architectural features go back to **GUPTA PERIOD**
2. Unlike the **NAGARA** temple, the **DRAVIDA** temple is enclosed within a compound wall
3. The front wall has an entrance Gateway in its centre, which is known as **GOPURAM**
4. The main temple tower is known as **VIMANA.** The **VIMANA** is like a **stepped pyramid** that rise up geometrically rather than the curving **SHIKHARA** of north India
5. A large water reservoir or a temple tank enclosed in the complex is general in south Indian temples

### 🧨🧨Mughal Art and Architechture

#### Architecture
1. INDO-ISLAMIC PERSIAN style is the chief characteristic feature of MUGHAL Architecture (amalgam of PERSIAN, TURKISH and INDIAN architecture)
    1. eg: in GJ - Mixture of HINDU and MUSLIM characteristics can be seen during **AKBAR**
2. Initial rulers had less time, focus on consolidation - Built some mosques at PANIPAT, LAHORE
3. During **AKBAR’S** reign, MUGHAL architecture had **regional influence** (GUJARATI, BENGALI and RAJPUT tradition), while **JEHANGIR** and **SHAHJAHAN** included **PERSIAN elements** predominantly
4. Large scale construction **under AKBAR- AGRA FORT** in red sandstone, other forts at LAHORE, ALLAHABAD, bulit FATEHPUR SIKRI- has **JAMA MASJID, BULAND DARWAZA, JODHA BAI’S PALACE, PANCH MAHAL, HUMANYUN’S TOMB IN DELHI**, use of balconies predomininant
5. There was **fusion of HINDU-ISLAMIC** architecture specially under **AKBAR**. One such influence is the **KALASH** placed on top of domes, hanging balcony
6. From the time of **JAHANGIR use of marble** very prominent- **TOMB OF ITMAD-UD-DAULA** by **NURJAHAN**
7. Fond of laying gardens with running water- eg **NISHAT BAGH IN KASHMIR, SHALIMAR BAGH AT LAHORE**
8. **SHAHJAHAN**- **climax** of fort building reached- **RED FORT DELHI** with its RANG MAHAL, **TAJ MAHAL**- architectural marvel, **JAMA MASJID DELHI**
9. Architecture declined by the **AURANGZEB’S** time (**BIBI KA MAKBARA**) due to his personal indifference and economic condition. Whatever monuments are there show traditional style only and lack of creativity. Instead the **monuments of the regional principalities** began to grow in their attraction. This shows the decline of the empire

#### Miscellaneous Points
1. **DIN-I-ILAHI** (Religion of God) in 1582. **DIN-I-ILAHI** was not a formal religion but rather a spiritual code that combined elements from various faiths, including ISLAM, HINDUISM, ZOROASTRIANISM, and CHRISTIANITY

### Sher-Shah Suri (can be used in Mughal era architecture)

- 1985: What are the differences between MUGHAL style of painting and RAJPUT style of painting?
    - **RAJASTHANI** and **PAHARI** are offshoots of MUGHAL miniature
    - MUGHAL miniature is secular (Hunting campaigns, portraits or scenes from DURBAR), while **RAJASTHANI** and **PAHARI** have religious touch. They included more religious themes as from life of RADHA KRISHNA, **GITA GOVINDA** and RAJPUT lifestyle.
    - MUGHAL art was largely a royal art, while RAJPUT style was practiced by folks as well
    - MUGHAL school features muted colours, giving it a shadow and depth, the **RAJASTHAN** school uses bold primary colours which give the painting an abstract look
    - MUGHAL style is evolved from PERSIAN MINIATURE painting style, so had marked influence of PERSIAN style which was mixed with local styles. **RAJASTHANI SCHOOL** has a considerable local influence on the other hand.
    - While MUGHAL school has focused on the splendour of the emperor and court, **PAHADI** and **RAJPUT** school expresses the emotions, nature, religious sentiments etc. Thus, **PAHADI** school could focus on life outside the royal sphere as well.

## Classical Dances

## Indian music
Indian music forms the very important aspect of Indian art and culture which finds it origin in the writings the of **BHARAT MUNI**. The first work that clarified and elaborated on the subject of musicology was **BHARATA’S NATYASHASTRA**

### Carnatic vs Hindustani Music
1. Region: HINDUSTANI classical developed in north India and **CARNATIC** in south Indian.
2. Influence: HINDUSTANI music has ARAB, PERSIAN and AFGHAN influences while **CARNATIC** is completely indigenous.
3. **Improvisation**: Artists given freedom to improvise hence variations observed in HINDUSTANI (such as **DHRUPAD, KHAYAL, TAPPA**, etc) while **CARNATIC MUSIC** has no such freedom.
4. Sub styles: Various sub-styles, called **GHARANAS**, are present in HINDUSTANI while **CARNATIC MUSIC** has only one prescribed style of singing
5. Instruments: Instruments have an **equally important role** in HINDUSTANI style while there is **more emphasis on vocal music in CARNATIC MUSIC**. **TABLA, SITAR** and **SANTOOR** are essential to HINDUSTANI classical while **VEENA, MRIDANGAM** and **MANDOLIN** to **CARNATIC** and **FLUTE** and **VIOLIN** are common to both.
6. Type: HINDUSTANI has emotional music while **CARNATIC** is intellectual and spiritual. 7. **SARANGI** vs **VIOLIN**; 8. RAGA based KRITI based 8. Examples: **M. S. SUBBULAKSHMI, THYAGARAJA, TRINITY**
    1. RAGA

#### Similarities
- Both religious tones; RAGAS borrowed from each others; Authority of musical treatises like **NATYASHASTRA** and **SANGEET RATNA-KARA** is recognised by both the streams of music

    - **Early Phase** believed that **universe owes its origin only to the nature**. this atheistic tradition inspired BUDDHISM & JAINISM
    - Later phase switched to the **belief of DUALISM/DVAITVADA** which says Universe is created by both nature (**PRAKRATI**) and divinve agency (**PURUSHA**)

## Bhakti and Sufi Movement

- 2014: SUFIS and medieval saints failed to modify either the religious ideas and practices or the outward structure of HINDU/ MUSLIM societies to any appreciable extent. Comment. (Answered below as limitations)
- 2018: The **BHAKTI MOVEMENT** received a remarkable re-orientation with the advent of **SRI CHAITANYA MAHAPRABHU (SCM)**.
    - Born in **MAYAPUR, BENGAL**
    - **JATRA** traditional theatre - musical & dance based relation
    - His SAMPRADAYA is called **GAUDIYA**
    - **ISKCON** was the follower of **SCM** (thus world’s largest religious structure is being built in **MAYAPUR** to honour **SCM**)
    - Philosophy of **ACHINTYA BHEDA ABHEDA** (philosophy of **inconceivable one-ness and difference** - by **SCM**)
    - Write other general points of **BHAKTI MOVEMENT**

### Bhakti Movement
- **Thing of regionally diverse examples:** **LAL DED, GURU NANAK, DADU DAYAL, MIRABAI, TUKARAM, BASSAVANA, SCM, SHANKARADEVA** (don’t worry TT Desk, NIRGUNA saints se example yaad aa jayenge)
- The **BHAKTI MOVEMENT** started in the 6th-7th century AD from the Southern part of the country. It was a religious reform movement which emphasised on single-minded intense devotion to God. It advocated for a personal connection to God through complete devotion and surrender. The movement is classified into ‘**NIRGUNA**’ and ‘**SAGUNA**’ traditions

#### Important features
- Unity of God or one God though known by different names. eg: **ACHINTYA BHEDA ABHEDA (philosophy of inconceivable one-ness and difference** - by **SCM**)
- The **NIRGUNA SECT** even discarded the need of physical depiction of god
- Belonged to diverse background (BRAHAMAS, lower caste, weavers)
- **Role of GURU -** needed to guide devotees to embrace salvation
- **BHAKTI**, intense love and **devotion**, the only **way to salvation**
- **Condemnation** of complicated rituals, ceremonies and blind faith; **Rejection of idol worship**
- Open-mindedness about deciding religious matters
- **No distinction of different castes**, higher or low
- Preaching’s through **local or regional languages** and abdicating elite languages like SANSKRIT

#### Impact: (Issues tackled Caste, Religion, Social Evils, Gender/Women, Language, Music, Misc)
- According to them there was no distinction and consideration of high and low castes on the basis of birth. Their doors were open to all classes. For example, through the concept of ‘**LANGAR**’ by SIKH GURUS
- Tried to generate an environment of **good will between the HINDUS and the MUSLIMS**. Most of the promoters stressed that **RAMA** and **RAHIM** were one and the same. Some of the rulers adopted liberal religious policies under the impact of the **BHAKTI MOVEMENT**.
- The **BHAKTI** saints were **social reformers** also. The evil practice of **SATI** received some **set back**.
- Concept of **VASUDEV KUTUMBAKAM** given by **RAMANUJACHARYA** ⭐ (The concept of **VASUDEV KUTUMBAKAM** is ancient, found in **MAHA UPANISHAD**, predating **RAMANUJACHARYA**. While **RAMANUJACHARYA** promoted universal love, attributing the origin of this specific phrase to him might be inaccurate.) (**STATUE OF EQUALITY**)
- **Women were encouraged** to join KIRTANS. **MIRABAI, LAL DED** (KASHMIRI SHAIVITE), **ANDAL** (only female ALWAR), **BAHINABAI** (devotee of **LORD VITTHOBA**)
- Local languages can be sole question: In place of SANSKRIT, **BHAKTI** saints preached through the medium of local languages which could be understood very easily. **SURDAS** used ‘**BRIJ**’ dialect. **TULSI DAS** composed his works in ‘**AWADHI**’. **SHANKARADEVA** popularizing **ASSAMESE, CHAITANYA** spreading their message in **BENGALI, MIRABAI** in HINDI and RAJASTHANI
- **GYANESWARI** was written in **MARATHI, BASAVANA’S VACHANA** enriched **KANNADA**
- Even in SUFISM, local languages were promotes eg: **AMIR KHURAO** used **BRAJ BHASHA** with PERSIAN for couplets. New local language **HINDAVI** emerged from URDU
- The greatest gift of the KARNATAKA'S **BHAKTI MOVEMENT** was the development of **CARNATIC CLASSICAL MUSIC**. **PURANADARADASA** is considered as the father of **CARNATIC CLASSICAL MUSIC**
- Emphasised earning of wealth through honest means. It encouraged the value of social service to the poor and the needy. It developed a humanitarian attitude. It pointed out the virtues of contentment and self control; Importance of **MENTAL HEALTH** was emphasised in talks of **LAL DED**

#### Limitations of both Bhakti and Sufism together
- There was **no royal patronage** for these movements which could have assist it in propagation. The **upper class of the society was still orthodox** and opposed the changes in the outer structure of the religion.
- The **SUFI** saints and **BHAKTI** saints did **not form institutional structures**. In the absence of organization, the lineage of saints could not continue for a long
- The movement **further divided the HINDU society**. For instance the followers of **KABIR** came to be known as **KABIR PANTHIS**
- The **SUFI** and **BHAKTI** saints **failed to offer a proper alternative to the social customs** that they attacked. Thus, the absence of an alternative to the social customs left the status of the traditions unaffected
- Political offices accepted by **SUHRAWADI** and **NAQSHABANDI** schools of SUFISM; Could not reform hardline MUSLIM rulers such as **AURANGZEB**
- These movements **were functioned locally (RAIDAS** had impact in **AWADH** area) and there was little or no interaction among these religious leaders. **Lack of integration** was the major region that it failed to leave a large impact
- While their message was received by a good number of audience, the **memory of the same could not last long due to the nomadic nature** of these saints

#### Famous Leaders
- **SAGUNA**: **RAMANAND** (his disciples were **KABIR** and **RAVIDAS**; Used HINDI to propogate), **NAMADEVA** (praised **VITHOBA**), **TUKARAM** (**founder VARI-VARKARI SECT, PANDHERPUR MH**), **CHAITANYA MAHAPRABHU, TULSIDAS** (wrote **RAMCHARITRAMANAS**)
- **NIRGUNA**: **KABIR, GURUNANAK, RAVIDAS** (propogated place called '**BEGUMPURA**’)

#### South vs North Development
- **South** was 7-9th Century; Developed vernacular lang like TAMIL; Impacted temple arch - not just worship but place to sing dance (eg: TIRUPATI) + evident in the continued importance of temple festivals in South; Role of various saints;
- **North** was 14-17th century; Here also diverse languages; Regionally diverse (somewhere KRISHNA, Somewhere RAMA); Shift away from ritualistic and caste- based practices towards a more personal and direct form of devotion; **blended HINDU and ISLAMIC elements due to interaction with SUFISM**
![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 24.jpeg]]

### Sufi Movements
- SUFISM was a **liberal reform movement within ISLAM**. By the end of 10th century, a group of people turned to mysticism (meditative) and asceticism in protest of materialism of CALIPHATE. They were critical of dogmatic interpretation of QURAN and SUNNA
- SUFISM rather stressed the elements of love and devotion as effective means of the realisation of God. In SUFISM, self discipline was considered an essential condition to gain knowledge of God. **While orthodox MUSLIMS emphasise external conduct, the SUFIS lay stress on inner purity**.
- SUFI saints such as **MOINUDDIN CHISTI, NIZAMUDDIN AULIYA, FARIDUDDIN GANJ-E-SHAKAR (aka BABA FARID)** were the pioneer SUFIS who are still loved, respected and honoured in India

#### Important features
- Concept of **SILSILA** which was an **unbroken spiritual lineage** connecting the ALLAH/PROPHET with the PIR (master) and finally the MURHSID (disciple)
    - #diagram ALLAH → PROPHET → PIR → MURSHID
- They preached spirituality through **music**, which **remembered God by ZIKR** (reciting name), this enabled reach to common masses. Their musical gatherings were called **SAMA**. Many women too were able to enjoy and contribute to SUFI music. **KHAYAL STYLE** owes a lot to SUFISM
- The SUFIS were very **liberal in their religious outlook**. Even today, **DARGHS** of SUFI saints are visited by both HINDUS and MUSLIMS and people from all castes. It played a key role in bringing the HINDU and MUSLIM communities together.
- They believed in the essential unity of all religions and thus took ideas not only from QURAN, but also from HINDUISM, BUDDHISM, CHRISTIANITY etc. In the later period, **AKBAR** appreciated SUFI doctrines which shaped his religious outlook and religious policies.
- They **openly crticised the rulers of their time** eg: **NIZAMUDDIN AULIYA (**_HUNUZ DILLI DOOR AST-WITH GST_**)never paid visit to any SULTAN** (while there were few SUFIS who also accepted political offices)
- SUFIS too composed poems and a **rich literature** in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. The most notable writer of this period was **AMIR KHUSRAU** the follower of **NIZAMUDDIN AULIYA**
- The SUFIS rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by MUSLIM religious scholars.

## Numismatics

- 2017: How do you justify the view that the level of excellence of the GUPTA NUMISMATIC ART is not at all noticeable in later times?
    - Explain the spectacular nature of **GUPTA COINS**;
    - Reasons for reduced excellence post **GUPTA** is:
        - Fall of **ROMAN EMPIRE**, loot by **HUNA TRIBES** impacted the flow of coins in later periods
        - **SOUTH INDIAN COIN** designs were confined to **DYNASTIC CRESTS**– boar (**CHALUKYA**), bull (**PALLAVA**), **tiger (CHOLA), fish (PANDYA)** while some **CHALUKYAN** coins left one side blank
        - Focus of rulers shifted to other factors eg: **HARSHAVARDHANA** focused on **BUDDHISM** (and less on coinage)
        - **MULTIPLE DYNASTIES** arose between HV and **GUPTA** (therefore less focus)
        - Prohibition of idolatry in **ISLAM** severely limited the scope of beautifying coins of **DS** and **MUGHAL PERIOD**. Kings also had to debase their currencies thus reducing lusture and quality
        - Medieval kings were involved in continuous feuds within and across other dynasties leading to lesser time
        - British coins were monotonous in design as they had textual information on obverse side and portrait of the king or queen on the reverse side

### Evolution of Numismatics
- Timeline: **PUNCHMARKED COINS** under **MAGADHA** (non - uniform eg: **KARSHAPAN**) → Post MAURYAN (**INDO-GREEK** gods/bi-lingual, **SATVAHANAS**-lead, **SHAKAS**-dates) → **GUPTA** → Southern (**CHOLA** had king standing, fish of **PANDYAS**) → **RAJPUT** (SANSKRIT names)→ **DELHI SULTANATE (TANKA & JITTAL** by **ILTUTMISH, RUPIAH** by **SSS**) → **MUGHALS (MOHUR, ILLAHI COINS)** → BRITISHERS
- **PUNCH MARKED COINS**: Early coins were die-struck manually and therefore were not uniform in shape and design. **PUNCH MARK COINS** of **MAGADHA** were very famous, they generally had five symbols. MAURYAN coins were also punch marked (as mentioned by **CHANAKYA**) eg: **NISHKA, SATMALA, KARSHAPANA**
- Post-mauryan phase:
    - **INDO GREEK COINS**: First to issue gold coins, bilingual (GREEK and PALI), GREEK gods and bustor heads of kings
    - **SATAVAHANAS**: First to use lead coins, coins are devoid of any beauty
    - **SHAKAS/SCYTHIANS**: Head of the king on one side and BUDDHIST CHAITYA or STUPA on the the other (first to have dates)
- **GUPTA AGE**: coins were mainly made of gold; Depicted kings in martial acts (hunting, posing with weapons) as well as leisurely activities (playing the **VEENA**, sitting on a couch, talking to queen) on one side and images of goddess on other side; **KUMARADEVI COINS**
- Southern:
    - **CHALUKYAN DYNASTY**: With one side haivng animal/temples and other side left blank
    - **PANDYA**: Issued square shaped coins with elephant/fish
    - **CHOLA KING RAJA RAJA-I** had the standing king on one side and seated goddess on the other side
    - Coins made under **VIJAYNAGAR DY** were called **FANAM** and **TARA**
- **RAJPUT COINAGE**: name of the king in SANSKRIT on one side and a goddess on the other side
- **DELHI SULTANATE**: coins did not bear any image, had details of names and year; **SILVER TANKA** and **COPPER JITAL** was introduced by **ILTUTMISH**; Token currency by **MB TUGLAQ; RUPIAH** and the **DAAM** by **SHER SHAH SURI**
- **MUGHALS**: standard gold coin of the MUGHALS was the **MOHUR; AKBAR** brought **ILLAHI COINS, JAHANGIR** had coins with couplets and zodiac signs
- Paper currency and coins also brought by BRITISHERS

### Significance of coins

### 2018: Safeguarding the Indian art heritage is the need of the moment. Comment [Significance & threats to A&C]
- India has a **vast basket of diverse art and cultural** heritage which **need institutional support and encouragement** to address areas critical for their survival and preservation.

#### Threats faced
- **Change Agents:** Tourism, Modernisation, Globalisation (Cultural homogenisation), Technology replacing entertainment experience (**PUPPETRY** has been **replaced by TV)**, **Mechanisation of art forms** (machine made sarees)
- Reducing interest and awareness, Smuggling/Theft (**STOLEN ARTEFACTS, NO UNIFORM DATABASE**), Mechanisation of art forms (machine made sarees are cheaper) hurting traditional work, Cultural homogenisation due to globalisation, **Poor maintenance** (eg: poor state of **AJANTA** paintings), **Unregulated tourism,** Encroachment on monuments, Recents incidents at **RED FORT** (farm law issues); Use Societal change agents - Global/urban/Commercialisation of festivals, Private trade without any authority to claim it - eg: **AMRAVATI** taken by BRITISHERS (good practise: **SULTAN JEHAN** protected **SANCHI**); Technology replacing entertainment experience; **DECAYING STATE OF CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS**
- 2023: MINISTRY OF CULTURE said that **50** ~~of India’s 3,693~~ centrally protected monuments have **gone untraceable**

#### Significance
- India has a **unique** identity in the world for its art and culture which represents Indian civilization on world platform and if it vanishes the uniqueness of India will get affected.
- Economic: Tourism potential for art monuments and museums is very high; It creates jobs for a lot of people from art industry including tribals
- Art heritage also represents “unity in diversity” of India and binds people together
- Art and culture is also a part of soft power in world politics (**INDIAN COUNCIL FOR CULTURAL RELATIONS (ICCR) offers more than 3,500 scholarships annually** aimed at promoting intellectual and academic activities of India)
- Understanding past had made us a better society today. Eg: culture of urbanisation from HARAPPAN age helped planning of **CHANDIGARH, CHAUSATH YOGINI** to **PARLIAMENT**
- Various art are on the verge of extinction such as **MANJUSHA PAINTING** of BIHAR, traditional art of **PUPPETRY**, NAGA craft, etc.
- **Soft Power -** International monuments conserved by **ASI** → **BAMIYAN BUDDHAS (AFGHANISTAN), ANGKOR WAT (CAMBODIA)**

#### Way Forward
- **Strengthening Legislation** and Initiatives: The **ANTIQUITY ACT OF 1947, ANCIENT MONUMENTS AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES AND REMAINS ACT (AMASR) ACT 1958, ANTIQUITIES AND ART TREASURES ACT OF 1972** particularly provide for the prevention of smuggling and illegally dealing in antiques
- Tapping of the **PUBLIC—PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) MODELS** for sustenance of Arts and Crafts eg **ADOPT A HERITAGE SCHEME** through **MONUMENT MITRA**
- Strengthening institutions such as **ASI** - as **CAG** highlighted **ASI** needs to be more proactive and vigilant in its efforts
- Inter-agency collaboration - **ISRO** and **ASI** together to help conserve the architecture
- Cultural awareness: through curriculum modification, oﬄine and online training, involvement of universities and colleges in promoting
- Preserve art heritage through virtual media, and promote local paintings on products like face maks, wallet, mobile cover, pillow cover, etc
- Cultural Mapping (explained below): can play a vital role - govt has already launched a mission for the same, but it should now be taken on war footing (considering large scale impact of pandemic on traditional artisans, steps not taken would lead to loss of art)
- Conclusion: It is the duty of every citizen to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.

#### Current Measures
- **ADOPT A HERITAGE SCHEME**: Collaborative effort of tourism min, culture min, **ASI** to preserve monuments and provide basic amenties (clealiness, water, singnages, wifi) through **MONUMENT MITRA** (which can be pvt, public indus)
- **SCHEME FOR PROMOTION OF CULTURE OF SCIENCE**: Setting up of Science Cities and Science Centres in all the States of the country, implemented by **NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SCIENCE MUSEUMS**
- **NATIONAL MISSION ON CULTURAL MAPPING 2015**: Budget of 3000 crore
    - Cultural map that would chart geographies, artists, resources and institutions, find the gaps, and ensure optimal fund utilisation
    - **What can mapping do?** It can, for instance, locate a derelict cinema and renovate it as an auditorium in a town where there are none, or **create transport and tourism infrastructure around a declining craft village**
- **SAFEGUARDING THE INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE AND DIVERSE CULTURAL TRADITIONS OF INDIA**: cover all recognized domains of ICH such as oral traditions, language, Performing arts, Social practices, rituals, etc. Implemented by **SANGEET NATAK AKADEMI**
- **EK BHARAT, SHRESHTHA BHARAT** (which includes exchanges, cultural mapping of sites), **PROJECT MAUSAM, SEVA BHOJ SCHEME**
- **CDAC** made software named “**JATAN**” that is set to **revolutionise museum experience**; Similarly **DARSHAK** app allows details of objects by scanning a QR code; **DIGITAL HAMPI**
- **CULTURAL HERITAGE YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAMME** by **CCRT** aims to promote, understand and develop fondness for India’s rich cultural heritage amongst the youth
- Others: Tribal haats, **GI TAG** to the local products, e-haat, **AWSAR SCHEME - LOCAL HERITAGE AT AIRPORTS**
- **GI RECOGNITION** to **CHAAU MASKA** in WB - led to global recognition and economic prosperity
- Recent measures: Research centre on Indian Art set up at **ZURICH MUSEUM** by some art historic researchers

#### Why traditional arts are dying
- After the advent of new methods of communication and entertainment, the traditional art forms and their practitioners have suffered due to the **neglect of the new generation** and steadily decreasing customers

##### Problems
- Behavioural changes in people who are now thinking the ancient arts backward
- **Art forms are not seen as a viable mode of profession** due to the similar cheaper machine made products
- Traditional **PUPPETRY** has been replaced by the television, as a form of entertainment
- Increasing migration has further decreased the number of people who used to practice such arts

##### Methods to save them
- Providing funds to various museums to save the vanishing traditional arts
- **AIRPORT AUTHORITY OF INDIA (AAI)** has launched an initiative “**AVSAR**” - Airport as Venue for Skilled Artisans Of The Region
- **EKTA MALL – UNITY IN HANDICRAFTS DIVERSITY** is a showroom of handicrafts from different states
- **PM VIKAS (VISHWAKARMA YOJANA)** - for encouraging traditional arts and handicrafts
- **BHARAT SHRI** - Digitalisation of manuscripts
- Govt should help in linking the products of traditional art and crafts practitioners, with professional enterprises, which can procure the products at reasonable price, so as to project this field as a viable avenue for profession
- Annual art festivals, more and more awards for recognition, **using international platforms (eg: COP 13 LOGO OF CMS HAD KOLAM** which traditional art form of South India)
- Supporting **E-COMMERCE** websites to sell the Art forms

#### Decaying of Cultural Institutions
- Attached bodies under MoC: **ASI, NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF INDIA**
- Autonomous Bodies unde MoC: **AKADEMIS (SAHITYA, SANGEET, NAT. SCHOOL OF DRAMA, LALIT KALA AKADEMI), BUDDHIST INST, LIBRARIES, MUSEUMS, ZONAL CULTURAL CENTRES**
- **Cultural institutions serve the purpose of conservation of one’s heritage and its passing on to future generations**along with its modern adaptations. In India although some cultural institutions have been and still are pillars of strength, but a lot many are fading into oblivion due to host of factors mainly poor governance, stagnation and poor upkeep.

##### Reasons
- The **head** of theses institutions is normally a **generalist senior bureaucrat** who has no special knowledge or work experience in the cultural domain of that institution **(often treated as ‘punishment’ posting)**
- **Budgetary allocation** for upkeep, modernisation, digitalisation is hardly significant, the case of museums in Indian is a glaring example (**Total budget of FY24 ~3200 crore is equivalent to cost of 2 RAFALE JET PLANES**)
- No proper policy or guidelines are formed to guide the working of these institutions. The case of **ASI** digging for gold at the behest of epiphany of old SADHU pointed this.
- Dilapidated structures, **prone to hazards**, like the fire in **NEHRU MUSEUM** in DELHI, **WATERLOGGED KESARIA STUPA** in BIHAR
- **NATIONAL MUSEUM OF INDIA, NATIONAL ARCHIVES** as well as **INDIRA GANDHI NATIONAL CENTRE** are set to be demolished to make way for the **CENTRAL VISTA PROJECT** (relocation is complex process; The artefacts at **NATIONAL MUSEUM** still lack complete inventory)
- Misplaced priorities: Committee formed in 2016 to study ‘evolution of Indian culture from 12,000 years ago’ did not submit report even in 2021 (**RTI** revealed)

##### WF
- The need of the hour is the interjection of ICT, dedicated policy, regular fund allotment in budget, specialised experts as heads.

#### Challenges wrt stolen Artefacts
- An integrated database of existing and stolen artefacts hardly exists in India with the **NATIONAL MISSION FOR MONUMENT AND ANTIQUITIES**, hence sufficient information on theft cases is very difficult. The **MINISTRY OF CULTURE’S** initiative to document the seventy lakh antiquities in its possession in 2007 has only reached eight lakhs until 2014
- The **CBI,** which handles antiquities theft as part of its special crimes division, is **overburdened** and also does not have the requisite qualifications.
- Some state governments have special wings as part of their police force but these too are understaffed and unqualified
- The **process of registering antiquities** under the **ANTIQUITIES AND ART TREASURES ACT 1972** is **extremely cumbersome** and the act is outdated also
- Fear of unnecessary government attention also deters registration
- The **CAG** report on Antiquities in 2013 remarks about the country’s poor acquisition, documentation and conservation systems like museums

#### Indian Culture Abroad
India had established commercial contacts with other countries from the earliest times. It had inevitably resulted in the spread of Indian languages, religions, art and architecture, philosophy, beliefs, customs and manners
