    1.  three subsets of our diaspora: the Old Diaspora, the New Diaspora, and the Gulf Diaspora. There is one consistent theme to all three categories. They were, and continue to be, created by a labor migration – unskilled labor starting two centuries ago, and highly skilled labor after the mid-1960s. The first wave of the Indian Diaspora is what we call the “Old Diaspora.” It began during the early 19th century and continued until the end of the British Raj. Indentured labour went to Mauritius, Suriname, Trinidad, Fiji (Caribbean, Africa, and Asia)
    -   Today this “Old Diaspora” constitutes 60% of our Indian diaspora, or approximately 18 million PIOs. The Old Diaspora is primarily a pre-WWII phenomenon. The New Diaspora, on the other hand, consists of migrants who left India in large numbers from the mid-1960s onwards – primarily to developed countries like the UK, US, Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.

**2013: In respect of India-Sri Lanka relations, discuss how domestic factors influence foreign policy**

**Ans:**

1.  India voted in favour of a US sponsored resolution in UNHCR in 2013. It was alleged that it was due to domestic political pressure. None of the other neighbours voted in favour of the same thus safeguarding their bilateral relations with SL. India’s stand: SL did not fulfill assurances given through the bilateral channel
2.  Intervening during civil war in SL through Peace Keeping forces backfired towards India → Trust deficits → Assasination of PM. All this was due to pressure of domestic factors and concern of rights of tamilians

### INDIA-AFGHANISTAN RELATIONS

**Intro:** KM Pannikkar (Indian statesman) rightly said that developments in Kabul valley inevitably affect the empires of the Gangetic plains

**Afghan reconcillation process**

-   Taliban emerged to fight Soviets- however 9/11- US campaign against Al-quaeda and Taliban- meanwhile elected afghan govt but 1/3rd area contested and no peace
-   US Taliban peace deal will lead to Taliban gaining centrality in Afghan affairs but India supports the Ashraf Ghani government and backs the idea of an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned, and Afghan-controlled process.
-   India critical of Taliban due to terror activities (IC 814 plane hijack)
-   US military engagement became a strategic liability for them as priorities shifted to Indo-pacific to contain China

**India’s Interest in Afghanistan**

-   Economic and Strategic Interest
    -   Afghanistan gateway to the oil and mineral-rich Central Asian republics(imp for India), anyone who is in power in Afghanistan controls the land routes
    -   reconstruction plans offer a lot of opportunities for Indian companies
    -   India has investments in Afghanisatan
-   Security Interest:
    -   to prevent Pakistan from setting up a friendly government in Afghanistan and prevent terrorism from Pakistan supported groups such as Haqqani network(anti-india Taliban militant group)
    -   to avoid the return of jihadi groups, like al Qaeda, which could strike in India.

**Measures (What is our approach and role)**

-   Indian projects- the Afghan Parliament, the Zaranj-Delaram Highway, and the Afghanistan-India Friendship Dam (Salma Dam), along with India’s assistance of more than $3 billion in projects, hundreds of small development projects (of schools, hospitals,library and water projects) have cemented India’s position in Afghanistan.
-   Latest dam for cooperation: Shahtoot Dam on Maidan River
-   Traning Afghan cricket team- Dehradun home ground
-   Duty free access to indian markets, training diploamts along with military, 1000 scholarships to students
-   Peace process: EAM addressed initial session of Intra-Afghan peace talks, indian envoy present at US-Taliban deal
-   Approach: India has avoided any military presence in Afghan and advocates need for international secuirty presence till afghan becomes self-reliant

**Challanges**

-   India’s Dilemma
    -   Continue with “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan controlled process'' (considering that the elected Afghan Government is hardly in control, the peace process has become US led and Taliban controlled)
    -   OR entering into direct talks with the Taliban (major departure from its consistent policy of dealing only with recognised governments)
-   Dent in India’s Goodwill: Afghans insipred by inclusive democracy as well as india’s dev projects-dent due to recent events in India, especially the controversy over the CAA
-   Exclusion of India: India finds itself on the margins of international diplomacy in Afghanistan despite developemt work (not invited at 6+2+1 summit by UN sectariat (included China,Pak,Us,Russia etc)
    -   Recent- US brought India into peace plan for Afg, whereas Russia plan kept India out
-   Connectivity challenges: Denial of transit by Pakistan
-   Taliban/Haqqani network rule- want to reimpose sharia law and issues of human rights may emerge- refugee problem for India (due to past incidents of attacks, abduction of indians)

**Way forward**

-   Efforts take to bridge the Ghani-Abdullah divide(two power centres in Afghan polity), and bringing together other major leaders who have pro-India attitude
-   Diplomatic route to be included in 6+2+1 process
-   Pakistan peace efforts recent ceasefire agreement should be used for co-op for Afghan peace
-   India can consider special envoy, Track II diplomacy or direct diplomacy with the Taliban given growing international legitimacy of T and chances of controlling govt in future for security interests
-   Need to rope in regional players such as Iran, China and Russia who have convergent interest in seeing settlement in Afghanistan

In the current situation, it is essential for India to maintain its strong links with the Afghan government, build and support its traditional Afghan allies and open lines of communication with the Taliban

**India’s Stand**: Peace process must not create any areas that leave space for proxies to thrive → Calls for for greater engagement will all sections

-   Indias’ engagement with Taliban led Afghanistan
    -   Strategic necessity: Rising violence in J&K, Support to terror groups in Pakistan
    -   Policy of engagement must be guided by **regional diplomacy** rather than bilateral engagement eg: Moscow 10 engagement led by Russia
    -   Also pressure must be mounted on Taliban to make **govt inlcusive, refrain** from allowing use of **afghan soil for terror**

    -   Multiple visits at highest political level are keeping the r’ship vibrant
    -   Hydropower cooperation- Mutually beneficial to both sides
        -   Tala , Kholongchuu hydro-P project, Dorjilung project(trilateral with BG)- I help in hydro projects and and buy back power from them, utilisation of untapped potential of similarly in Nepal,bang etc
    -   Development assistance: India supporting the Tax Inspectors Without Borders program of Bhutan by sharing tax admin & audit knowledge (TWIB is a program of UNDP & OECD)
    -   Economic development: Largest trading partner of bhutan; Duty free access to india along with transit access to 3rd countries; 100mn standing credit facility
    -   Security: Integrated protection through eastern command of Army/air force; CT operations such as Op. All Clear; Training military, Doklam coop

### INDO-PACIFIC

-   **Introduction**
    -   Integrated theatre that combines Indian ocean and the Pacific ocean inc land masses that surround them with a view that their interests are linked (not considering both oceans as sep)
    -   Geographic interpretation differ- Like US see it till Indian shores but India,Japan extends it till African shores
    -   In the 21st century, the destiny of the world will be decided on its waters
-   **Importance**
    -   Imp sea lines of communication with critical choke points- Mozambique channel, Malacca strait,Bab-el-madeb
    -   Trade- 62% of world GDP and almost 50% of merchandise trade
    -   Threats like piracy,trafficking,terrorism,env protection require collab effort, richness in natural resources- hydrocarbon,sea-bed minerals etc
    -   China factor- BRI,disregard on Int rules (disobey PCA on SCS), Militirisation- djibouti naval base, Hambantota etc
    -   India specific interests- geopoplitcal aspiration as net security provider needs expanding presence in the region, Indian ocean carriers 90% of Indian trade and its energy resources
    -   Inclusion of I-P strategy, means India can never be confined b/w Malacca Strait & Gulf of Aden
-   **India’s initiatives:**
    -   India’s stand: wants a ‘Inclusive’, free & open I-P; ASEAN Centrality is key; Equal acess to sea and air, rules based order is key part of I-P- PM keynote speech at Shangrila diaologue
    -   Indo-Pacific Division at MEA- collab with BIMSTEC,IORA,Mekong-ganga for Indo-pacific
    -   Indo-Pacific Ocean Initiatives 2019, IONS (for maritime co-op and sec), Vision SAGAR- holistic policy for promoting I multi-dim intrest in indian ocean with co-op), Project Mausam (understanding how knowledge on monsoon has shaped interaction in history and focus on shared Knowledge in future)
    -   Security provider and first responder for HDR in Maldives,Mauritius and other nations (Operation Vanilla at Madagascar)
    -   Dialouges at various levels Quad, Trilateral dialougues, ASEAN centered institutions,
-   **Challenges faced:**
    -   Differences in understanding of players eg: at Quad as well as whole Indo-pacific- each has varying deegrees of priority as well fruitful China rlship
    -   Antoginse china- while othe players sits far, for us C at border
    -   Limited nature of Indian capacity - lack of military base wrt China, issues in assumption islands, slow pace of dev in Asia-AF growth corridoor (AAGC)
-   **Way forward**- should engange other players such as Micronesia islands, QUAD+ to include SK,Vietnam,NZ etc
    -   Italy showed interest to join trilateral with India/Japan on Indo-Pacific framework; India can tap this as to solve today’s complex geo-pol problems, traditional rigid alliances do not show results
-   **Quad**
    -   Formed in 2007 (revived in 2017), Quad is a group of 4 like minded democracies of Indo-Pacific aiming to discuss issues of mutal interest such as free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and rules-based international order
    -   Not a formal agreement; However discussions now take at foreign minister’s level
    -   Signficance: _Quote importance of Indo-Pacific, bilateral relations with memb_
        -   Post covid supply chains imp
        -   Supplementing India’s defense capabilities through joint patrols, exchanging information(2+2 with all members, 4 agreements with US, logistics exhange mechanism with Japan, mult-exercises-Malabaretc)
        -   Convergence with other nations ranging from France to Japan (various nations are bringing out their Indo Pacific strategies)
        -   Demonstrates a united front to check belligerent activities of China (China is expecting its South asian partner to stay away from Quad - this could be further benefit Quad as nations unite towards pushing back China’s belligerence)
    -   Challenges:
        -   Lack of clarity on the agenda of Quad - difference in opinions of members - India promotes freedom of navigation but is reluctant in using warships through EEZ, For Japan,Aus-Pacific is imp but for I , indian ocean takes primacy
        -   Asymmetry among members in terms of finances, military, etc which may lead to an imbalanced partnership & burden sharing. Quad is seen to pivot around USA
        -   China percieving it as anti-china coalition along with strong eco ties with others (Quad appears to be cross purposed with India’s membership at SCO, BRICS, RIC); Chinas
        -   India is the only country in Quad which is not in Pacific as well as shares land border with China
        -   Standoff at Ladakh has raised questions on Quad and India-US relations as the fight with China is continental whereas cooperation at Quad is marine
    -   Way Forward: Strategic imperatives alone cannot drive cooperation for long, we need wider areas of cooperation to sustain the relation. India’s steps such IPOI are in the right direction
        -   Malabar Exercise with Quad should be accompanied with India acquiring requisite combat and deterrence capabilities (such as anti-submarine warfare tech) to generate long term gains rather than short terms. If this is not achieved, India’s deterrence potential in the IOR will not be increased

**India-Australia**- 2+2 elevated to FM, mining co-op, mutual logistics agreement, Comprehensive strategic partnership, Aus announced ‘India eco strategy to 2035, civil nuclear co-op, diaspora(students),supply chain res initiative( issues- CECA inconclusive, RCEP disagreements

### SOUTH CHINA SEA DISPUTE

**Importance of South China Sea**

**Issues with South China Sea**

-   Territorial conflict: Philippines, Vietnam, China, Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia hold different territorial claims China claims more than 80 per cent of it through its “nine-dash line” which extends upto 2000 km from mainland(remember EEZ 200 Nautical milles- around 332 km)
-   Vietnam, China claims sovereignty over the Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands(Philippines claims this too)
-   Violation of International rules: In 2016, China rejected UNCLOS Arbitral Tribunal ruling.(said China cant encroach on EEZ of other states)
-   Challanges to US hegemony- ASEAN,Japan,SK are US allies- China hegemon undermines US hegemony in region. Also inc militarisations of region by both affects freedom of navigation for countries such as India and others

**Global Response**

-   ASEAN hints for balancing China with India,US along with steps for collab with China
-   US conducts Freedom of navigation operations to maintain its hegemony
-   India has favoured inclusivity and plurality,need to be respectful of the region’s preference for consensus-based approaches.

-   **Significance**
    -   ASEAN is central to India's Indo-Pacific Vision and India's Act East Policy and contributes to SAGAR
    -   Geo-Strategic choke points such as Malacca strait and signif trade passes through Indian Ocean
    -   ASEAN is a pivotal consumer market (with rising consuming class)
    -   Counter China’s power projection which is a common challenge for both
    -   Common interests to promote rules-based order, peace and stability, unimpeded commerce, ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight, etc. as well as concerns related to terrorism, radicalisation, drug trafficking, human trafficking

-   **Conflicts and future challenges**
    -   Economic issues: Trade deficit is rising (~24bn in 19-20); Market access issues faced by India in areas such as agri/marine goods; Resistance in opening labour market thus india dissatisified with progress on FTA in services
    -   Failure of RCEP
    -   Limited capacity of India while providing development assistance, market access, etc.
    -   Infrastructural deficiencies is acting as a hindrance to development of region
    -   Chinese influence with ASEAN being China’s largest trading partner
-   **Current measures for cooperation**
    -   Economic coop:
        -   Bilateral trade ~$90 bn - ASEAN is India's fourth largest trading partner
        -   FDI inflows are there from both sides (more by ASEAN than India)

    -   Poltical & Security coop:
        -   30 Dialogue Mechanisms between India and ASEAN, cutting across various sectors and multilayered from Summit level discussions to Minister level meetings to track 1.5 events such as delhi dialogue
        -   Mechanisms such as ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting plus
        -   Defence cooperation agreement with Indonesia including port facility at Sabang Port (Indonesia)
    -   Socio-Cultural coop:
        -   Training Programmes for ASEAN diplomats, 1000 phd fellowship at IITs, major tourist destinations for Indians

### RCEP NEGOTIATIONS

-   **Significance**: World’s biggest free trade pact; Almost half of world’s population; one third of global GDP; Trade b/w them makes upto 25% of global trade
-   **Why India pulled out?**
    -   Trade deficit has been increasing - Current deficit of $ 100 bn+ (of which china is 53 bn)
    -   India wanted RCEP to exclude MFN obligations from the investment chapter to balance its recent FDI policy with bordering nations
    -   Lack of protection to domestic industries as proposals for strict rules of origin and auto-trigger mechanism to impose tariffs were not accepted
    -   Shallow coverage for service sector while steep opening for goods segment
    -   Lack of convergence in areas of e-commerce, IPR, shifting base year from 2014 to 2019
        -   In contrast to commitments for goods under RCEP, the service sector has seen shallow coverage of areas (example resticting movement of natural persons)
    -   Domestic issues: Concerns of manuf, dairy, agri and labour groups
-   **Implications**
    -   Withdrawal from RCEP, call for self-reliance, etc. might be perceived as India taking a protectionist stance
    -   Isolation, loss of potential investments and lack of competition might affect India’s performance in terms of exports
    -   Impact on bilateral ties with memb nations as they will focus more on the bloc; Similarly it may impact India’s revival in the post COVID world
-   **Way Fwd:**
    -   Future course of discussion must accomodate concerns of India. Meanwhile India should work towards EoDB, Infra, to ensure it can reap adequate benefit while being part of the global value chain
    -   Mere signing of an FTA does not guarantee an increase in exports. FTAs can ensure market access **to only** the right quality products made at competitive prices. Country cannot become a significant part of **global value chains** unless it has efficient ports, customs, shipping, roads and a regulatory compliance infrastructure

### INDIA-JAPAN RELATIONS

-   **Significance (factors shaping relations in current times)**
    -   EU strategy on India 2018 views EU-India relations in the context of broader geopolitical developments (countering rise of China);
    -   Convergence of interests in the Indian Ocean as the Indian Ocean is the main conduit for global trade and energy flows

-   **Conflicts and future challenges**
    -   Stalled EU-India BTIA- negotiated since 2007, diff on crucial issues such as wine(France), automobiles (Germany), IPR (pharma issues- same as US, India’s data localisation, norms for movemenet of workers, huge subsidy by EU to dairy industrySanitary and technical barriers to trade (alphonso mango), Demand for Data secure status for India’s IT industry
    -   Trade - India account for only 2% of EU goods trade (China-14%), EU-Veitnam FTA- affect India’s exports (also various nations are part of China’s BRI)
    -   India’s perception of EU as trade block- lack of substantive agreement on security and connectivity with EU rather bilaterally with France etc
    -   Human right concerns of EU- EU parliament critical of both Kashmir 370 decision and CAA, Italian marine issue
    -   There is an untapped export potential of $39.9 bn. India benefits from EU’s GSP, however major products have either graduated or are on the brink of graduation under the same. This highlights for a need for BTIA (to deepen trade and investment ties)
-   **Current measures for cooperation**

    -   France was the first European country to launch an Indo-Pacific strategy and India is a key pillar in that strategy (specific interests in the Indian Ocean such as Reunion Islands & Mayotte)
    -   Strategic convergence over rising Chinese profile in Indo Pacific as well as breakdown of the rules based global order (both share interest in developing a coalition of middle powers)
    -   France is among the countries that have consistently supported India’s permanent membership to UNSC. France offered unstinted support for India on surgical air strikes as well as issues of J&K

    -   Ties with immense awe from Indian side
-   **Significance**
    -   Russia has the largest known natural gas reserves of any state on earth, along with the second largest coal reserves, and the eighth largest oil reserves
    -   In the immediate-term, Indian and U.S. perspectives are less convergent in India’s continental neighbourhood. Connectivity and cooperation with Afghanistan and Central Asia need engagement with Iran and Russia (rather than USA)
    -   ~~Convergence on Indo-Pacific~~ (there is no such convergence as Russia sees Indo-Pacific as American construct & seen as an effort to contain Russia-China)
    -   Historical- communist revolution inspired many INM leaders-Nehru, Bhagat singh, 1971 treaty, space co-op
-   **Conflicts** - check if there are other conflicts
-   **Reasons for recent downturn in relations**
    -   India’s growing proximity to the United States which came side by side with Russia’s growing hostility with the West. Russia views Quad as tool used by Western powers to engage India into anti-China games
    -   Diversification in defence partnership with USA, Israel has led to fall in share of Russia (Russian imports fell from 79% between 2008-2012 to 62% between 2013-2017)
        -   With USA, we have signed four foundational agreements showing enhanced interoperability b/w militaries. India Russia relation lacks this aspect
        -   Trade has been one-dimensional (defence based) and below potential compared to India’s trade with other nations
    -   General Issues: connectivity issues, distance, weak banking links, cumbersome regulations on both sides and Russia’s restrictive visa regime
    -   Russia’s changed foreign policy posture:
        -   Towards Pakistan where it lifted arms embargo in 2014 and conducted military exercises, building Stream gas pipeline recently
        -   Towards China: Ties range from military, endorsement of BRI, energy (Power of Siberia pipeline)
            -   (After RR 1917- USSR renounced its imperialist claims over China unlike west- shows current bonhomie)
            -   Moscow is downplaying China’s display of coercion at Indian border and is uncritically supporting China’s global vision
        -   Russia is showing inclination towards Taliban in Afghanistan while India continues to have concerns about the group
        -   All these changes impact Russia’s ability to act as balancing power for India
-   **Steps taken to address the downturn in relations**
    -   Relation elevated to "Special Privileged Strategic Partnership” at Sochi Informal summit btw Modi and Putin
    -   Reinforcement of defence ties: Su-400 air defence systems and nuclear-powered submarine (Chakra III) deal, Trilateral exercise under the name INDRA
    -   India Russia Strategic Economic Dialogue 2018 to build upon trade ties and achieve revised targets
    -   India participated in Eastern Economic Forum (2020) which aims to support the economic development of Russia’s resource rich Far East - for which india contributed $1 bn LoC; Proposed Chennai-Vladivostok Maritime link
    -   Other misc: Collaborated investments in Vietnam; India voted in favour of a Russian led UN resolution to set up a separate convention on cybercrime (as opposed to Budapest)
    -   Growing proximity with European Economic Union with which there are talks of signing a FTA
-   **Current measures for cooperation**
    -   Defence partnership: Russia supplies about 60% of India’s imported military equipment by value. Ties rest on 3 features of technology transfer, joint development, marketing & selling and export of equipment. Collaborations have been done for Sukhoi, Brahmos, AK47-203 Rifles, etc. Significant purchase such as S-400 system
    -   Economic Ties: Revised targets (as earlier ones were achieved) of increasing bilateral investment to US $ 50 bn (25 bn each way) and bilateral trade to US $ 30 billion by 2025.
    -   Energy: Development of nuclear plants (Kundankulum reactors), Indian investment in oil & gas fields such as Sakhalin I. Also, collaborated investment by I-R in Vietnam’s oil and gas sector. Both sides can also benefit from the proposed Energy Bridge from Arctic to Vladivostok to Chennai
    -   Space: Provide cryogenic tech, launched India’s 1st two satellites - Aryabhata and Bhaskar; Training astronauts for Gaganyaan
    -   Support for UNSC seat, NSG seat; Collaboration at global stage via BRICS, SCO, G20, RIC, etc.
    -   Cultural/P2P: There are regular cultural initiatives to promote people-to-people contacts between India and Russia in the form of tourism, education, etc. There is a strong tradition of Indian studies in Russia eg: Hindi being taught at some univ, etc.
-   **Way forward**
    -   Trade is low compared to potential, thus there is scope for improvement
-   **Conclusion**
    -   Relying on nostalgic sentimentalism of past won't work anymore as new challenges confront India- russia relationship (Modi - underlining that one old friend better than two new ones (Pak,China)
    -   However need to remain deeply engaged as Russia will remain key source of sensitive tech and hardware as well as imp component to re-affirm India’s strategic autonomy wrt relations with major powers

        -   eg: The frictions over solar panels has allowed China to effectively capture world market (way fwd-thus both sides should solve the issue together soon)
        -   Trade issues highlighted by USTR: market access restrictions, high tariffs, unpredic regu requirements (Both India-USA are working for revival of US-India Trade Policy Forum-down since last 4 years)

        -   June 2020: USA announced & then withdrew 25% tariff on imports from various countries incl India using Section 301 of Trade Act 1974, against imposition of digital tax on US tech giants by these firms
        -   India needs to weigh its options: either it will impact revenue collection from digi firms or will impact its exports
    -   S-400 tensions (CAATSA)
    -   Visa Issues (remember 5-6 economic issues to the trade aspect-can be a question)

    -   Primary responsibility is to work to maintain international peace and security. It takes the lead in determining the act of aggression. UNSC calls for parties to a dispute to settle it by peaceful means through adjustment and settlement. In some cases it can can resort to imposing sanctions or even authorize the use of force to restore peace
    -   15 members: 5 permanent + 10 non-permanent (5 of which are elected annually for a 2 year term)
    -   Composition: Five for African and Asian countries. One for Eastern European countries. Two for Latin American and Caribbean countries. Two for Western European and other countries
    -   **+ve role**: UN peace keeping forces, Sanctioning terrorists eg: Resolution 1267 wrt Masood Azhar
-   **Issues with organisation:**
    -   Veto powers possessed by the P5 are used for their geopolitical interests, regardless of the disastrous consequences for the victims of armed conflict. As it can be seen in Syria, Iraq, etc
    -   Does not reflect today’s distribution of military and economic power, nor a geographical balance
    -   Membership at UN has increased with no corresponing change in the composition of the UNSC
    -   Portrays the big North-South divide: While Europe is over represented, Asia is under represented. Africa and South America have no representation at all
    -   Biased: For example protecting the oil-rich Kuwaitis in 1991 but poorly protecting resource-poor Rwandans in 1994
    -   Alleged issues of bribery (in the form of inc in tranfers from UN/USA to elected members) have also come up
-   **Reforms:**
    -   As former UN secretary general noted that “No reform of the UN would be complete without reform of the Security Council”
    -   There is a need for democratic framework and expansion on lines of 5 sets of issues identified below -
    -   Five sets of issues have been identified by the General Assembly. These are 1. Categories of membership 2. The question of the veto 3. Regional representation 4. Size of an enlarged Council and its working methods and 5. The Security Council-General Assembly relationship.
-   **India at UNSC:**
    -   Agenda: achievement of N.O.R.M.S: a New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System,” India will prioritise the following:
        -   New opportunities for progress (inclusive solutions)
        -   Addressing international terrorism’s abuse of ICT and break terror finance
        -   Reforming multilateral system (indicating UN/UNSC reforms)
        -   Promoting technology initiatives with human touch to drive solutions
    -   PM Modi called for a ‘**reformed multilateralism’** thus a global system which is more representative as it can lead to sustainable peace and prosperity (indicating India’s push for permanent seat at UN)
    -   Benefits for India: Strong diplomatic voice for India, Aid recovery in post covid world, Articulate concerns of global south
    -   **+ve role played in previous council entries**: Adoption of resolutions calling for cessation of hostilities during the Korean War, Pushed strongly for admission of Bangladesh into the UN, Leading voice for resolution of conflicts in the Middle East (especially Palestine), Initiative of CCIT
    -   Steps taken by India for reforms:
        -   Multi-layered strategy consisting of 2 components: Maximising support in the UNGA and Minimising resistance in the UNSC
        -   Building strategic partnerships with P5
        -   Other forums such as: G4, G77, NAM, African Union, etc.
-   **Conclusion**: We’re a billion plus country which is a democracy, perhaps an only example in the history; We can bring these value into working of UNSC. That’s our USP, we try and work out solutions

### UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION (UNESCO)

-   **Current status and issues with the org**
    -   Criticism of UNESCO for bloated bureaucracy leading to waste of money
    -   Instead of uniting people, organisation has become very politicised
    -   Funding crunch which got more intensified after withdrawal by USA, Israel, etc.
    -   Impact: cut programs, freeze hiring, 2017 budget was almost half its 2012 budget, loss for multilateralism
-   **Reforms needed**
-   **India- focus**
    -   India has been a member of the UNESCO since its inception in 1946.
    -   UNESCO constitution requires that each Member State should have a principle body that shall work with the Organization. Thus, in India, Indian National Commission for Cooperation with UNESCO (INCCU) was commissioned. UNESCO has New Delhi Cluster Office for eleven countries in South and Central Asia

### WHO

-   **Basics**
    -   Established in 1948 as specialised UN agency with an aim to expand international health cooperation. HQ: Geneva, Switzerland
    -   Main objective is ensuring “the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health.”
-   **Structure and mandate**
    -   The WHO has a three-tiered structure, comprising:
        -   World Health Assembly- supreme decision-making body comprising all member states to determine policy direction. . It also appoints the Director-General every five years
        -   Executive Board - comprises of 34 technical experts to oversee the implementation of WHA’s decisions.
        -   Secretariat - headed by the Director General and functions as WHO’s administrative and technical organ with the overall responsibility for implementing its activities
    -   Funding: Assessed contributions given by members based on population/GNI and Voluntary contributions
    -   WHO's main functions: Act as a directing and coordinating authority on international health work; To promote research; Setting the standards for Global Health; Monitoring and assessing health trends and concerns;
    -   By 2023, WHO proposes to achieve **3 billion targets**: 1 billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage. 1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies. 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being
    -   **+ve role**: Immunization programs, Effort sto advance development of vaccines during COVID, Countering misinformation, Developing standards, Providing research support, Collaborating with NGOs and other UN bodies, Providing assistance to regional and global organisations
-   **Current status and issues with the org**
    -   Lack of defined functions- There is no single document which comprehensively describes its responsibilities, obligations and powers
    -   Unlike WTO, WHo has no ability to bind or sanction its members (as powers are recommendatory)
    -   Limited funding- WHO’s annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019. Financial constraints encumber autonomy in decision making leading to donor driven agenda
        -   The share of assessed contributions in WHO’s annual budget has declined over the years, to the extent that they now constitute just 24% .The rest is through voluntary contributions
    -   Issues with handling COVID: Delayed response despite data about SARS; Delay in declartion of public health emergency of international concern/Pandemic; Rather than advocating for travel restriction it said urged not spread fear and stigma by imposing it; Alleged biased stance taken by director general towards china; Did show any urgency in sending an investigation team to China; Delay in response by WHO has directly impacted situation of many countries in Africa & Asia which rely predominantly on WHO
-   **Reforms needed**
    -   WHO requires a systematic overhaul of its structure and practices to build this capacity
    -   Need to reduce donor dependency so that agenda is guided based on principles of equity
-   **India- focus**
    -   Indian Health Minister took charge as the chairman of the WHO Executive Board.
    -   The WHO India Country Cooperation Strategy 2019–2023 outlines how WHO can support the MoHFW in achieving its health sector goals, improving the health of its population and bringing in transformative changes in the health sector

### NDB, AIIB, ADB

-   AIIB and NDB presents an alternative to the existing American and European dominated World Bank and IMF
-   Main difference between them is AIIB operates in Asia-pacific region but New Development Bank operations concentrate more in BRICS nations. AIIB is mainly focused on bridging the gap between demand and supply of capital for development of infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region whereas NDB is more centered on environmentally sustainable development projects.
-   Unlike the World Bank, which assigns votes based on capital share, in the New Development Bank each participant country will be assigned one vote, and none of the countries will have veto power
-   Role of all banks is similar - therefore one can develop points on line of giving loans/guarantees, providing equity support, provide technical advisory services, coordinating development policies and plans of member countries, etc.
-   The multipolar world order is coming to an end. The AIIB and NDB is an indication of the same
-   NDB & India: NDB fast-tracked financial assistance of about $5 billion to BRICS countries including Emergency Assistance of $1 billion to India to combat Covid-19 pandemic

| | **ADB** | **AIIB** | **NDB** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Members | 68 | 100+ | 5 |
| HQ | Manila, Philippines | Beijing, China | Shanghai, China |
| Voting power | Based on share capital, China highest | Based on share capital, China highest | Equal |

### NPT @ 50 YEARS

-   **Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)**: Signed in 1968 (came in force in 1970); Requires countries to give up any present or future plans to build nuclear weapons in return for access to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 3 main objectives are non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful use of nuclear tech. India’s stand is follows:
    -   5 states are permitted to possess nuclear weapons while other have to remain non-nuclear weapon states - India rather wants complete disarmament
    -   India believes it is a biased legal instrument that divided the world into “nuclear haves” and “nuclear have-nots’
    -   Act as restriction on India’s political autonomy and foreign policy choices (given that 2 neighbours are already nuclear powers)
    -   However, in spite of India not joining NPT, India’s unblemished record on non-proliferation and its consistently responsible posture on nuclear weapons that enabled it to successfully conclude the Indo-US nuclear deal in 2008 and to obtain a waiver from the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), enabling it to resume international cooperation in the nuclear domain and gain access to the international civil nuclear market
-   **Successes:**
    -   Dramatic reduction of nuclear weapons of two cold era super powers: From a peak of 70,300 warheads in 1986 to around 14,000 at present, with the US and Russia accounting for over 12,500
    -   Controlled proliferation: Since 1970, only four countries have acquired nuclear weapons, bringing the total number of nuclear-weapon-states to nine (apart from P5, 4 states are India, Pak, North Korea, Israel)
    -   Treaty facilitates cooperation on peaceful applications of nuclear technology under the watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
    -   Estab of nuclear-weapon-free zone (NWFZ) such as Latin-America and the Caribbean, Africa, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific
-   **Concerns that remain:**
    -   The 5 nuclear states under treaty are also the P5, which gives a conclusion that nuclear weapons remain the currency of political and military power
    -   Unsettled international security environment as evidences by withdrawal from JCPOA, Instability in W.Asia, U.S.-North Korea negotiations at a halt, Turkey’s aspirations of being nuclear power, etc.
    -   The treaty has no sanctions for violators or for withdrawal from the treaty
    -   Loopholes where country with weapons could sign the NPT as a non-weapon state and not give up weapons already made (as NPT forbids the acquisition but not its possession)
-   **Way Foward:**
    -   More stakes on USA and Russia: They could help themselves by agreeing to extend New START to 2026 and launching in-depth strategic stability talks to cover nuclear weapons and the full range of associated issues (they are the ones that possess majority of nuclear war heads)
    -   For answer on India centric viewpoint, way forward can be written based on India’s stand

### G7

-   G-7 is a bloc of industrialized democracies i.e. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, and Canada
-   Bloc meets annually to discuss issues of common interest like global economic governance, international security and energy policy. The group does not have a formal constitution, fixed headquarters and decisions taken at summits are not binding
-   **Recent developments:**
    -   UK has invited Indian PM as a guest to attend the 47th G7 summit that is scheduled to be held in June 2021. Australia and South Korea are also invited
    -   Previously, USA President had also proposed the expansion of the G7 to be called ‘G10 or G11’
    -   However, this is not the firs time when India would attend the G7 meeting
-   **Significance for India at G7:**
    -   UK thinks that the Indo-Pacific region will be central to the 21st century, and India will be central to the Indo-Pacific. Invitation proves this point
    -   After many years of robust economic growth, India is now the sixth largest economy in the world and will soon overtake the UK itself to become fifth. It has already surpassed existing G7 members such as Italy, France and Canada. (invitation acknowledges this point)
    -   Diplomatically, a seat at the high table could help New Delhi further its security and foreign policy interests, especially at the nuclear club and UN Security Council reform as well as protecting its interests in the Indian Ocean.
-   **Demerits:**
    -   Expanded G7 is seen as an attempt by the US to form a joint front against China
    -   Faultlines within the group such as issues b/w US and Germany over Iran nuclear deal can impact India’s bilateral relations with the nations on board
    -   May impact our non-alignment strategy
    -   Restricted economiestric focus of the group might not aid India much
-   There is lack of clarity on expansion as some members believe their role will be diluted while other feel that Eurocenworld’s major economiestric focus of the group will be lost. _Lets see what happens after July 2021 meeting_

**G7 Vs G20**

-   **Members**: The G20 is a larger group of countries, which also includes G7 members.
    -   Apart from the G7 countries, the G20 comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, and Turkey.
-   **Share in Global Economy**: The G20 countries make up around 80% of the world’s economy. G7’s share in global GDP has fallen to around 40%.
-   **Range of Issues**: As opposed to the G7, the G20 discusses a broad range of issues including those concerning the global economy and financial markets

### G20

-   **Why in news?**
    -   Rome Session in 2021 on Global Economy & Health; Previously G20 decided 15% minimum tax rate
-   **Basics:**
    -   Significance: 80% of world GDP, 75% of global trade and 60% of the population
    -   Formed in 1999, it is an international forum that brings together world’s major economies
-   **Structure & mandate:**
    -   Objectives: Policy coordination between its members to achieve global economic stability; create a new international financial architecture (as it was formed after Asian Financial Crisis 1999)
    -   G20 has two working tracks:G20 has two working tracks:
        -   Finance Track: The primary focus is on global economic and financial issues such as monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies, infrastructure investment, financial regulation, financial inclusion and international taxation
        -   Sherpa Track: The focus is on broader issues such as political engagement, anti-corruption, development, trade, gender equality, energy and climate change
    -   Various level of discussions are carried out such as Summits, ministerial meetings, Sherpa meetings (in charge of carrying out negotiations and building consensus among Leaders), working groups and special events
    -   As there is no permanent secretariat, a "Troika", represented by the country that holds the Presidency, its predecessor and its successor, works to ensure continuity within the G20
    -   **+ve role:**
        -   Quick deployment of emergency funding during the 2008 global financial crisis; Advocated G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, Supported economies and supply chains during COVID-19
        -   G20 played a critical role in the ratification of the Trade Facilitation Agreement
        -   Increasing the lending capacity of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and collecting richer information on the shadow banking system
-   **Issues**
    -   The exclusivity of its membership has attracted criticism as its decisions can have impact non-member countries. Critics also point at disproportionate non-representation of African countries
    -   Every country, which assumes presidency, wants to put their stamp on it. And therefore, every country would like to add some issues from their own perspective, like Japan did, by including ageing and society 5.0.
    -   G20 lacks an objective framework through which to set goals and measure progress toward them
    -   G20 authority is also weakened since some major members sometimes fail to fulfil their commitments (e.g., the delay of the IMF reform due to resistance from the U.S. Congress)
-   **Way Forward:**
    -   There should be continuity of issues taken up in the previous presidencies along with appreciation of new issues in the subsequent presidencies
    -   Redoubled efforts are also needed in fields like infrastructure and food security so as to address the North-South imbalance

### WORLD BANK VS IMF

-   **Purpose:**
    -   WB: Background was reconstruction of the war-ravaged economies, therefore WB has a primary responsibility for financing economic development
    -   IMF: Background was great depression which led to unpredictable variations foreign exchange rates. IMF constituted a code of conduct where it requires members to allow their currency to be exchanged for foreign currencies freely and without restriction. To help nations abide by the code of conduct, the IMF administers a pool of money from which members can borrow when they are in trouble. The IMF is not, however, primarily a lending institution as is the Bank
    -   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) oversees the stability of the world's monetary system, while the World Bank aims to reduce poverty by offering assistance to middle-income and low-income countries.
-   **Size and Structure**
    -   WB: Larger staff of 7000, and has various affiliates or subsidiaries (5 bodies together form WB Group; IDA and IRBD are together called World Bank); **Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030**and boosting **shared prosperity** of the poorest 40% of the population in all countries
    -   IMF: Smaller staff of 2300, with no affiliates or subsidiaries
-   **Source of Funding**
    -   WB borrows money by selling bonds and notes directly to governments, their agencies, and central banks. The proceeds of these bond sales are lent in turn to developing countries at affordable rates. It is an investment bank, intermediating between investors and recipients, borrowing from the one and lending to the other
    -   IMF is not a bank and does not intermediate between investors and recipients. It’s resources come from quota subscriptions, or membership fees, paid in by the IMF's members. While the Bank borrows and lends, the IMF is more like a credit union whose members have access to a common pool of resources (the sum total of their individual contributions) to assist them in times of need.
-   **Recipients of Funding**
    -   Neither wealthy countries nor private individuals borrow from the World Bank, which lends only to creditworthy governments of developing nations and under developed nations.
    -   In contrast, all member nations, both wealthy and poor, have the right to financial assistance from the IMF
-   **Similarities b/w WB and IMF**
    -   In contrast, all member nations, both wealthy and poor, have the right to financial assistance from the IMF
    -   Both institutions concern themselves with economic issues and concentrate
    -   Both have headquarters in Washington, D.C, Both originated at Bretton woods conference
-   **Issues with World Bank**
    -   It is alleged that WB caters to the agenda of World Capitalism in the garb of its "free market" economic policy reforms imposed as a condition for receipt of loans
    -   No adeqaute role for emerging powers such as India, China and other countries
    -   The leadership succession does not reflect on the purpose of multilateral body
    -   Failure of World Bank to adapt to the changing world order may see rising economies going their own way. eg: estab of NDB by BRICS
-   Deep reforms of the World Bank are necessary as part of rethinking the current world order, and giving rising powers and developing countries a meaningful voice in this institution
-   **Issues with IMF**
    -   Large voting share of EU/USA, BRICS nation collectively only 15%, very modest reforms(in 2015) due to hesitance of west
    -   Conditions on loans affect sov of nations- require detailed structral changes (privatisation, blind faithin free market) which are difficult in welfare focused democracies
    -   One size fits all plan ny IMF/WB technocrats without understanding decentralised needs of countries
-   **Reforms needed in IMF**
    -   The G7 group contains more than 40% quota (US alone 17%)where as countries like India & Russia have only 2.5% quota in IMF.- less borrowing space as dependent on quota- reform this, need more share for developing C
        -   Need Easy voting - currently requires 85% but US share -clear veto
    -   Better rep to emerging economies and developing C in Board

### SCO

-   **Basics**
    -   SCO is a permanent intergovernmental org whose aims have transformed from providing stability across border in central asia to more diverese areas such as security, eco, political, cultural coop
    -   Created in 2001 and India/Pak have joined in 2017
-   **Structure and mandate**
    -   Objectives:
        -   Strengthening mutual trust and neighbourliness among the member states
        -   Promoting effective cooperation in -politics, trade & economy, research & technology and culture
        -   Enhancing ties in education, energy, transport, tourism, environmental protection, etc
        -   Maintain and ensure peace, security and stability in the region
    -   Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) – Established to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism
    -   SCO Secretariat – Based in Beijing to provide informational, analytical & organisational support
-   **Current status and issues with the org**
    -   China/Russia have a dominant role as CA is their backyard. Thus there is limitations in India’s ability
    -   India may also have to either dilute its growing partnership with the West or engage in a delicate balancing act - as SCO has traditionally adopted an anti-Western posture
    -   Differences of India with others as it did not endorse BRI. Moreover, there are difference also in terms of definition of terrorism
    -   India-Pak relation may weaken the spirit of SCO
    -   Despite being geographically close, the rich diversity in member’s history, backgrounds, language, national interests and form of government, wealth and culture makes the SCO decision making challenging.
-   **What can India do?** (same points can be used for approach towards CA)
    -   Pursue the idea of SCO Energy Club (as group has both power producers and consumers)
    -   Rope in more members towards India-centric projects such as Chabhar project
    -   FTA with Eurasian Economic Union
    -   Fastrack works such as INSTC, Ashgabat, Chabahar, etc
    -   Through the SCO, India can also work on anti-drug trafficking and small arms proliferation
-   **India- Benefits**
    -   Help Connect Central Asia Policy of India
    -   Boost regional integration and connectivity measures
    -   Gain insights from SCO’s RATS Intelligence sharing and SCO’s Counter-Terrorism drills
    -   Opportunity to engage with Russia, China in regional format

    -   Funding for global challanges like poverty etc as well provide techinical support to nations in Africa, middle east wrt policy making at ECOSOC and imp outside

### UNHRC

-   **Intro**
    -   Estb in 2006 by UNGA resolution- intergov body mandated for promotion and protection of HR along with taking action on HR violations. It replaced earlier UN commision on HR. It reports to UNGA
    -   47 member states elected by UNGA for 3 yrs term with one-third retiring each year(India member 2019-2021), has pre-defined geo distribution of seats(like 13 from asia-pacific etc)
    -   Decision/resolution/recommendation not legally binding on states

        -   Secret ballot- need for open ballot for more HR discussions
    -   Geographical quota system- Regional groups usually nominate actual no. of states- limits choices for small uninfluential countries, also lead to election of states with bad HR records
    -   Focus on states own interest rather than HR as an issue- makes it highly politicised
    -   Israel and UNHRC- accusation of being biased towards Isreal- most no. of resolutions- in 2018 US pulled out of UNHRC calling it cesspool of pol bias that makes mockery of HR
-   **Reforms needed**- adress above issues in prescriptive way
-   **India- focus**(i.e how India benefits from it, what India should do for its interest wrt org, how India can play leadership role wrt other small nations etc)
    -   Kashmir, Pak elected till 2023 so need for active diplomacy to contain, India member till 2021 should be used to make long term friends in council, address HR internal concerns too apart from diplomacy.

### UN PEACEKEEPING

-   to help countries torn by conflict to create the conditions for lasting peace.
-   financial resources of UN Peacekeeping operations are the collective responsibility of UN Member States. Decisions about the establishment, maintenance or expansion of peacekeeping operations are taken by the United Nations Security Council.(India wants reforms at this aspect)
-   UNPK forces deployed on consent of main parties to conflict, UNPK is impartial and use force only in seld-defence, use force only at tactical level with UNSC authorisation

**India’s contribution to UN peacekeeping**

-   Contribution dates back to 1950 Korean war when India provided forces an doctors as peace building activity, provided more than 2 lakh military and police officers to UN Peacekeeping over 70 years, in more than 50 missions.
-   Currently among the largest troop contributors in the world, with over 7,500 personnel deployed in Cyprus, Congo, Haiti, Lebanon, the Middle East, South Sudan and Western Sahara
-   Also lost the **highest** number of its peacekeepers in various UN peacekeeping operations in the last 70 years, with 168 military, police and civilian personnel from the country laying down their lives in the line of duty, In 2007, India became the first country to deploy an all-women contingent to a UN peacekeeping mission in Liberia.
-   Peacekeepers have also brought the ancient Indian practice of yoga to UN missions.

### NON ALIGNED MOVEMENT

-   **Intro**
    -   formed during the Cold War as an organization of States that did not seek to formally align themselves with either the United States or the Soviet Union, but sought to remain independent or neutral.
    -   Idea at Asia Africa conf at Bandung 1955 (indonesia)(10 bandung principles identified - respect for sov, racial equality, non-interv, no collective defence pacts, UN lead peaceful solution to issues, HR etc)
    -   first NAM conf at Belgrade(Yugoslavia) in 1961 under leadership of India,Indonesia,Egypt,Yugo,Ghana
    -   120 members currently, based on ideals on Panchsheel- non iterference, mutual respect,non aggresion etc
-   **Current status and issues with the org**
    -   With the end of CW- loosing relavance, mere talkshop, unable to address concern of third world
    -   Several members like India first close to USSR then now USA in post 1991 need for tech, FDI,China etc
    -   As larger bloc- very diff to frame common views, absence of clear lack of leadership
    -   Alternative platforms like BRICS, IBSA, SCO Etc have emerged with overlapping agendas
    -   However still holds relavance as
        -   Strategic independence for developing C always relavant- new power centres-China-US,USSR etc- autonomy for policy to follow always relavant in global talks and diplomacy
        -   Collective voice of developing world with common challanges- need to act as coherent groups in trade,CC talks, environmental degradation, terrorism, radicalisation, poverty, public health emergencies - can only be faced together, not when world is divided- requires collaboration, not coercion. In short, effective multilateralism remains the only answer. NAM can be that answer.
-   **Reforms needed**
    -   India called for need to keep on updating agendas wrt global challanges and act as collective voice on issues, reforming international inst, pool best exp etc
    -   No need for broad position on selecting any idelogy or group rather based on micro issues facing developing C.
-   **Conclusion**
    -   A democratic, effective, flexible, credible, transparent and representative, multilateral organisation like NAM is imperative for 21st century world order.
-   **India- focus**(i.e how India benefits from it, what India should do for its interest wrt org, how India can play leadership role wrt other small nations etc)
    -   VP attended 18th NAM summit in Baku(Azerbaijan), Modi-Online summit for COVID 19- called it world’s moral voice, pointed out limitations of int orgs
    -   India should provide leadership as biggest platform for dev C outside UN, south-south co-op, UNSC reforms along with PM level participation in summit to give it more imp for Indian FP (Both in Venezuela and Azerbaijan- VP went)

### BRICS

**India to host summit in 2021**

-   **Intro**
    -   BRICS nations account for 23% of world GDP, 43% of world population, based on notion that its economies will collectively dominate global growth by 2050
    -   aim to promote peace,dev an co-op along with estab a more euitable and fairer world.
-   **Achievement of BRICS**
    -   NDB- non-western dominated bank, have Contigency Reserve Arrangement for BOP crisis support, expanding footprint by inc new members, 10b$ for pandemic
    -   Medical collab- Ufa declaration in 2015 to jointly combat infectious diseases, • BRICS Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Framework Programme for collab btw experts
    -   Expanding trade: Over the past five years, intra-BRICS exports grew by 45%, BRICS Rapid info security channel for exchange of info on cybersecurity(LOL)
    -   Recent Moscow declaration on online BRICS summit- Strategy for BRICS eco partneship 20-25, BRICS counter-terrorism strategy- strenghtening intra-BRICS ties in the area, improving intelligence sharing, urgency for extension of 2010 Russia-USA START treaty, need for glbal governance reforms wrt UNSC,IMF,WTO,WHO(although diff views on type of reform)
-   **Significance fo India**
    -   Safe space to manage conflicts- eg India-China remained discussing within BRICS during Doklam and recent clashes
    -   Maintain strategic autonomy during growing India-US convergence
    -   Provide transcontinental reach as Brazil,SA members- India as a global leader opportunities
    -   Boosting demands for reform of multilateral inst, along with creating new nonwestern inst
    -   Though initial start focused on economy, BRICS has been a platform to advocate for UN and UNSC reforms
    -   NDB loans- India largest beneficiary so far, non-conditional financing unlike WB,IMF- better for global south
-   **Current status and issues with the org**
    -   Political disparities among members, includes both democracy and authoritarian regimes( recent SA criticism of China due to racist attacks), other chinese issue of BRI debt trap, post pandemic hesitance wrt China etc
        -   US-India convergence, China-Russia bonhomie, India-China issues
        -   Lack of concentrated focus - India’s closer ties with USA, Russia itself being cast out of G8 grouping, China’s aggressive stance
    -   Grouping seeks to reform global financial governance but is divided over UNSC reform- countries such as china want to maintain status quo - focus only on selective reforms
    -   Dependency on other global inst- lack strategic vision of own due to differences over many issues
    -   Inadequate funds as compared to WB,IMF- need more capital in NDB
    -   Dominance of china in trade, other 4 countries have limited trade within themseleves
-   **Way ahead**
    -   increased intra-BRICS cooperation in areas like health, science and technology, finance, trade
    -   Better P-P ties- easy visa requirements for member nations, inducing collaboration among researchers, private sector collaboration.
    -   The future of BRICS will depend on how much the leaders agree to stand collectively against trade protectionism, global commons issues and ability to share a common political agenda.

### WTO

-   The World Trade Organization (WTO) - only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations- has 164 members (including European Union) and 23 observer governments (like Iran, Iraq, Bhutan, Libya etc).
-   Brettonwoods conference delegates recommended the establishment of the International Trade Organization (ITO)(apart from WB, IMF), which they envisioned as the third leg of the system.(however not formed) rather GATT formed- to phase out the use of import quotas and to reduce tariffs on merchandise trade, GATT sponsored 8 rounds of multilateral trade negotiation rounds.
-   The Uruguay Round, conducted from 1987 to 1994, culminated in the Marrakesh Agreement, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO)(included trade related aspects of services and IPR )
-   WTO-not a UN spec agency

**Functions**

-   The WTO’s global system lowers trade barriers through negotiation and operates under the principle of non-discrimination which promotes global growth
    -   In addition, the WTO agreements are full of provisions that take into account the interests of developing countries
-   The WTO can give the weak a stronger voice: Small countries would be weaker without the WTO.
    -   Coalitions give developing countries a stronger voice in negotiations.
    -   The resulting agreements mean that all countries, including the most powerful, have to play by the rules. The rule of law replaces might-makes-right.
-   The WTO can contribute to peace and stability: When the world economy is in turmoil, the multilateral trading system contribute to stability, deter protectionism and increase certainty

**Structure**

-   Ministerial Conference- The topmost decision-making body- meets every two years.
-   General Council- has representatives of member governments and has the authority to act on behalf of the ministerial conference.
    -   It also meets as the Trade Policy Review Body (Trade policy review of member states) and the Dispute Settlement Body (DSU)( establish dispute settlement panels,refer matters to arbitration, apoint persons to Appellate Body(standing body of 7 persons that hear disputes, its reports if accepted by DSB must be accepted by party ) for 4 year term, authorize suspension of concessions in the event of non-compliance with its recommendations and rulings.)
-   General council has 3 specific councils(for goods(GATT),for services(GATS)for IPR(TRIPS)
-   Global trade rules: Decisions in the WTO are typically taken by consensus among all members and they are ratified by members’ parliaments. This leads to a more prosperous, peaceful and accountable economic world.

**The Doha Round**

-   The Doha Round is the latest round of trade negotiations among the WTO membership- aim is to achieve major reform of the international trading system through the introduction of lower trade barriers and revised trade rules- also known as the Doha Development Agenda as fundamental objective is to improve the trading prospects of developing countries- launched at the WTO’s Fourth Ministerial Conference(MC4) in Doha, Qatar, in November 2001.
-   The Doha Ministerial Declaration provided the mandate for the negotiations,including on following subjects:
    -   Agriculture: More market access, eliminating export subsidies, reducing distorting domestic support, sorting out a range of developing country issues, and dealing with non-trade concerns such as food security and rural development.
    -   Non-agricultural market access (NAMA): To reduce or as appropriate eliminate tariffs as well as non-tariff barriers, in particular on products of export interest to developing countries.
    -   Services: To improve market access and to strengthen the rules.
        -   Each government has the right to decide which sectors it wants to open to foreign companies and to what extent, including any restrictions on foreign ownership.
        -   Unlike in agriculture and NAMA, the services negotiations are not based on a “modalities” text. They are being conducted essentially on two tracks:
        -   (a) bilateral and/or plurilateral (involving only some WTO members) negotiations
        -   (b) multilateral negotiations among all WTO members to establish any necessary rules and disciplines
    -   Trade facilitation: To ease customs procedures and to facilitate the movement, release and clearance of goods.
    -   Dispute settlement: To improve and clarify the Dispute Settlement Understanding
-   With 2008 crisis and fear of protectionism, Doha round enthusiasiam subdued
-   The 2013 Ministerial Conference (MC9) in Bali, Indonesia, delivered a significant achievement, the first multilateral agreement since the creation of the WTO- Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which aims to speed up customs procedures and make trade easier, faster, and cheaper.
    -   also reached an interim agreement (a peace clause) on “public stockholding” continuing exceptions that allow developing countries to stockpile agricultural products to protect against food shortages.
-   2015 Ministerial Conference Nairobi, Kenya (MC10) focused on a selected number of issues that are part of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). Agreement was reached on - Stopping the use of subsidies and other schemes unfairly supporting agricultural exports and other misc issues
-   But for many Nairobi signalled the end of the Doha talks, a sentiment that intensified after the 2016 election of Trump.
    -   President Trump made clear his preference for bilateral trade when he withdrew from the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) shortly after taking office.
-   In 2017 Ministerial Conference Buenos Aires (MC11), USA reflected the skepticism toward multilateralism when itblocked agreement on a draft ministerial declaration that would have “reaffirmed the centrality of the multilateral trading system and the development dimension of the organisation’s work.”
    -   Meanwhile, India, which has repeatedly threatened to block WTO agreements (including the Trade Facilitation Agreement) unless WTO members conceded to its demands on public stockholding for food security. India also toughened its stand on new issues including e-commerce and investment facilitation.
    -   In the end, it was a relief to many that the United States did not actively seek to dismantle the WTO—as some had feared. But giving up its traditional leadership role could lead to a similar result, only more slowly.

**Indian stance on WTO negotiations**

-   India is a founder member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1947 and its successor, the WTO.
-   Services exports account for 40% of India's total exports of goods and services.
    -   India has an obvious interest in the liberalisation of services trade and wants commercially meaningful access to be provided by the developed countries.
    -   Since the Uruguay Round, India has autonomously liberalised its Services trade regime across the board.
-   Ensuring food and livelihood security is critical, particularly for a large agrarian economy like India.
    -   India is persistently demanding for a permanent solution on public stockholding subsidies at WTO.
        -   At 2013 Ministerial Conference (MC9) in Bali, an interim agreement (a peace clause) was made on “public stockholding” continuing exceptions that allow developing countries to stockpile agricultural products to protect against food shortages.
-   India strongly favours extension of higher levels of protection to geographical indications for products likeBasmati rice, Darjeeling tea, and Alphonso mangoes at par with that provided to wines and spirits under TRIPS agreement.
-   Developed countries have been putting pressure on inclusion of non-trade issuessuch as labour standards, environmental protection, human rights, rules on investment, competition policy in the WTO agreements.
-   India is against any inclusion of non-trade issues that are directed in the long run at enforcing protectionist measures (based on non-trade issues, the developed countries like USA and European Union are trying to ban the imports of some goods like textile, processed food etc.), particularly against developing countries.

**WTO concerns**

-   Failure to reach conclusion of Doha dev agenda with 150+ members, diff to get a consesus
-   The 2017 WTO Ministerial Conference **(**MC11) Buenos Aires ended without any substantial outcome as consensus failed - USA blocked a permanent solution on government stockholding for food security purposes, resulting in India’s toughened stand on new issues including e-commerce and investment facilitation.
-   Developed countries led by the US and the European Union sought to find a way out of the deadlock at the WTO talks by forming large pressure groups on e-commerce, investment facilitation and MSMEs within the WTO with more than 70 members in each formulation.
    -   Though WTO is driven by consensus and even a plurilateral agreement needs approval of all members, the formation of these groups as an attempt to steer WTO away from its focus on multilateralism.
-   It’s fierce defense of ‘Trade Related Intellectual Property’ rights (TRIPs)—patents, copyrights and trademarks—comes at the expense of health and human lives
-   The U.S.A. has consciously (or not) destroyed the Doha round of trade negotiations process in formulating excessive demands that no country was prepared to meet.
    -   The priority of the Obama administration was not to revive a dying WTO negotiation, but to concentrate on its newly created alternative, the TPP(Trans-Pacific Partnership), to contain its competitors: Europe andChina.
-   For years now, the multilateral system for the settlement of trade dispute has been under intense scrutiny and constant criticism.
    -   The U.S. has systematically blocked the appointment of new Appellate Body members (“judges”) and de facto impeded the work of the WTO appeal mechanism.
-   Chinese mercantilism (encouraging exports and putting limits on imports), the USA’s aggressive use of unilateral tariff measures, and the inability of WTO members to reach consensus on expanding its disciplines to important new sectors
-   Challenges faced by WTO: Restoring dispute settlement mechanism, Divide over Doha development agenda, push for changing definition of ‘developing’ under S&DT, Tackle vaccine nationalism, Voluntary sharing and pooling of IPR to fight COVID

**Way forward**

-   Since the WTO is consensus-based, reaching an agreement is difficult. Explore plurilateral agreement with a group of like-minded countries (applied for Indian interests too) on a new set of rules that serve as an addendum (supplement) to the broader WTO.
-   World is going through the protectionism, trade war (like USA & China), and Brexit making global economy squeezed. The role of WTO in future is very crucial to preserve global liberalised economic system evolved since the end of the 2nd World War.
-   It is right time when countries like USA giving threat to withdraw from WTO making it dysfunctional, India and other emerging economies like Brazil, South Africa etc can provide a strong base for strong WTO with saving interests of
-   ![GS2 InternationalRelations](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS2 InternationalRelations 8.jpeg>)developing countries.
