### VULNERABLE SECTIONS

#### VULNERABLE SECTIONS

##### GENERAL WAY FWD:

-   Need for anti-discrimination law to address challenges faced by vulnerable sections (Article 15 does not cover discrimination based on disability, sexual orientation, linguistic identity, physical appearance, eating preferences etc.)

##### GENERAL

-   2014: Do government’s schemes for up-lifting vulnerable and backward communities by protecting required social resources for them, lead to their exclusion in establishing businesses in urban economies?
    -   Issues wrt schemes for vulnerable sections leading to their exclusion in entrep:
        -   Govt job preference- reservation and lower threshold of marks makes them focus on govt jobs instead of entrep
        -   **MGNREGA**- focusing on 100 days of work rather in developing skilled jobs
        -   **Attempts at UBI**- self sufficiency for basic needs hamper entrep spirit
        -   Rural policies such as **PURA**, **RURBAN** for stopping urban migration-hampers diversity in entrep ecosystem
        -   Social prejudice by upper sections- discrimination when they try to do entrep due to major govt policies for them (leads to their ‘Silent segregation’) Ex: No house to minorities, rejected from job as on wheelchair, etc
        -   Gender prejudice by women estb biz- seen as extra-progressive(Focus on marriage karlo)
    -   However- welfare state basic req of common min standards to all, also govt schemes give them dignity which help in building confidence and promots entrep
-   2018: Multiplicity of various commissions for the vulnerable sections of the society leads to problems of overlapping jurisdiction and duplication of functions. Is it better to merge all commissions into an umbrella Human Rights Commission? Argue your case.
    -   Issues of multiplicity- conflicting judgements, **NHRC** overlapping functions wrt women, dalits, interest of women and children are related, duplication of fx, etc
    -   Cons in merging- Overburdened commision, diff issues of diff vulnerable section, need special experts, **ST** very diff from others
    -   Therefore improve existing org-reforms covered in polity along with note on [Umbrella Human Rights Commission: GS-2 Polity & Constitution](https://quip.com/to8OAfF3ykpg#bSZACAzWWsh)
-   2013: Restructuring of Centrally sponsored schemes: merits, demerits, way fwd

    -   State issues
        -   Encroachment on state ability to govern and functions

        -   One size fits all- **neglect local requirements**
        -   **Limted flexibilty** to implement
    -   Steps taken
        -   **Shivraj singh C** on **CSS**- **Reduced schemes from 66 to 28** (earlier was 147 )divided into **3 categories: Core of the Core, Core schemes, Optional Schemes**
        -   **Involving states in preparing guidelines** of schemes for flexibility
        -   More flexi-funds, transfers to consolidated fund of state rather than direct implementing agencies
    -   **WF**- Perf linked financing to combat state disownership of schemes while giving more flexibilty to implement; **15th FC** - **Article 282** require an in depth holistic review

##### MENTAL HEALTH

-   💡: Key Stats → Lancet 1 in 7 Indian has mental disorder, Suicide rate 16.3 per lakh (Global avg 10.6); 0.01 mental hospital for every 1 lakh-WHO; Read bold points
-   As per **WHO** - 7.5% of the population, suffer from mental health issues; Suicide was the leading cause of deaths among young people — aged 15 to 39 — in 2016; **WHO has labelled India as the world’s ‘most depressing country’**
    -   According to **Lancet**, 1 in 7 people in India had mental disorder raning from mild to severe in 2017
    -   Suicide rate was 16.3 per 1 lakh population in 2016 (global avg 10.6)
    -   In news: **COVID**, **Withdrawal by Naomi Osaka** from French open
        -   **COVID-19** lockdown aggrevated need for **MHC** (mental health care)
        -   Withdrawal by **Naomi Osaka** from French open
-   Why focus on mental health? **Can reduce life expectancy by 10-25 yrs (as per WHO)**
    -   Impacts your thoughts, behaviors and emotions
    -   Important part in the health of your relationships
    -   Contributes to our decision making process, how we cope with stress
    -   Can reduce life expectancy by 10-25 yrs (as per **WHO**)
    -   Depressive disorders more prevalent among females (due to sexual abuse, discrimination issues)
-   Measures taken:
    -   **National Mental Health Policy 2014** (**promote mental health**, **promote destigmatization**, ensure socio-economic inclusion, right based approach) **National Adolescent Health Programme**
    -   **Mental Healthcare Act 2017** - brought **right based approach**, **removed penal provision for suicide** by presuming mental stress (Section 309 IPC had jail for attempting suicide)
    -   India’s 1st National Mental Health **Helpline ‘Kiran’**
    -   **Ayushman Bharat** also has component for **MHC**
    -   Medical staff - Distressed/burned out during prolonged 2nd wave of pandemic
-   Issues:
    -   Lack of awareness and sensitivity about the issue Ex: difficult to differentiate between feeling sad and depression
    -   **Tagged as ‘lunatics’ by the society** (ironic as community based residential centres are regarded an imp component of **MHC**)
    -   Low level of psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, mental health units in general hospitals, full fledged mental hospitals (**WHO** data says India has 0.01 mental hospital for every 1 lakh)
    -   **Violations of human rights** have been reported **in mental asylums** and also at homes
-   Way Fwd:
    -   India could reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders, increase the number of personnel in the mental health sector, work towards reducing discriminatory attitudes, and devise an integrated approach for detecting, treating, and managing patient needs. More counselling facilities, especially in rural areas, with special support for women through the provision of women doctors are needed. More telemedicine, telephone-based helpline numbers, and mental health apps could help. Communities and families have an important role in this regard and so do community-based programmes. School-based programmes on mental health can improve the mental health of children. More fund allocation for treatment of mental health, especially to those States in need of funds, could do wonders. The pandemic may be the best time to explore various policy options including creating online mental health awareness. Media and big data analysis can also play deciding role
-   Conclusion: **Everyone is fighting their own battle, some more silently than others**. Society needs to be compassionate and empathetic towards all. State mental health institutions, general hospitals, private practice, and **NGOs** can together help achieve the dream of mental health care for all

        -   **Woeful infrastructure** (health, transp, tech) to access basic services remain
        -   Suffers from triple jeopardy - disability, social stigma and poverty
        -   People with disabilities have special issues during virus outbreak: The people who cannot see rely on touch (cannot touch due to contagious virus); the ones who cannot hear rely on lip reading which gets blocked by a mask

-   **Hidden Dimensions of Poverty**: **Psychological** (affects mental health, self-esteem, and social status, leading to marginalisation), **Structural barriers** (barriers such as lack of access to quality education, healthcare, and employment opportunities), **Environmental** (located in areas prone to environmental hazards, which exacerbates their vulnerability; lack of clean water/sanitation); **IMF** and **WB** calls for fostering inclusive dialogue & engaging communities via bottom up planning and strong institutions;
-   **The Poverty Trap**: A vicious cycle where poverty itself creates barriers to escaping it. Limited access to education and healthcare can hinder opportunities for better jobs and income generation. Investing in education, healthcare, and social safety nets can empower individuals and communities to break free from the poverty trap
-   **MPI 2023 Findings: by UNDP**
    -   **25 countries, including India, successfully halved their global MPI** values within 15 years; **415 million**people in India were lifted out of poverty from 2005-**06** to 2019-**21**
    -   1.1 billion out of 6.1 billion people (just more than 18%) live in acute multidimensional poverty across 110 countries. **Sub-Saharan Africa** (534 million) and **South Asia** (389 million) are home to **approximately five out of every six poor people**
    -   Said lack of comprehensive data during the period of the **COVID-19** pandemic poses challenges in assessing immediate prospects
    -   Although low-income countries constitute only 10% of the population included in the **MPI**, these are where 35% of all poor people reside
-   **2023 National MPI Report by NITI**
    -   Significant decline in multidimensional poverty; from **24.85% (2015-16) to 14.96% (2019- 2021). Approximately 13.5 crore Indians escaped poverty during this period.**
    -   The number of states with less than 10% multidimensional poor doubled from 7 to 14
    -   ‘**BIMARU’ states**, viz., Bihar, UP, MP, Odisha, and Rajasthan witnessed the **fastest decline**
    -   **Issues**: Despite progress, **nearly one in seven Indians remains multidimensionally poor (wahi 14%)**, indicating the persistent challenges in addressing poverty and inequality. **Bihar has one-third population multi-dimensionally poor**. **WF**: **Generic wale health, education, jobs, public goods for New India,** data driven, **NGOs for randomised trials, Agri growth hub &spoke**

#### EXTRA CONTENT POVERTY

-   Poverty is the lack of sufficient money to meet the minimum standard of living-including food, clothing, shelter, health and education
-   Developmental Paradox → India becoming fastest growing economy but still host 22% of world poor
-   Poverty is not only about poverty; it is also about inequality
-   Targets under **SDG 1** - End poverty in all its forms everywhere
    -   Reduce to half from 21% to 10.95% population living below poverty line
    -   Target of zero homeless
    -   100% household coverage with atleast 1 memb having health insurance
-   Various dimensions of poverty:
    -   Financial, Health, Housing, Vulnerabilities to disasters, Gender specific vulnerability
-   Causes for its continuance
    -   **Social Causes**: Population explosion (High fertility rates causing poverty trap due to lack of family planning); Social barriers faced by vulnerable sections; Access to eduation; Gender inequality
    -   **Economic Causes**: Agriculture no longer viable (**NABARD** survey), Jobless growth, Inflation; Debt trap due to low asset base; Inequality (**Oxfam** report)
    -   **Political Causes**: Unable to excercise legal rights; Used as vote banks; No coodination **PM-Kisan** not implemented by West Bengal
    -   **Governance Issues**: Corruption/leakages; Resource curse; Not releasing personal consumption data/employment data (hampers data driven reforms) Ex: **MGNREA** Wage leakages
        -   Mutilple definitions of poverty - makes evaluation of policy effect difficult
-   Other Challenges:
    -   Regional Variance: Much of India's poverty is concentrated in rural areas and in low-income States. The differences bw states is stark - **CG** has 39.9% whereas **A&N Islands** has 1%
    -   **Feminisation of poverty**, especially rural poverty (P impacts women>men)
-   Upcoming challenges:
    -   Threats due to changing climate → inc in frequency of disasters
    -   Intensification due to **COVID** pandemic
-   Defining poverty
    -   National:
        -   **Alagh Committee (1979)** determined a poverty line based on a minimum daily requirement of 2400 and 2100 calories for an adult in Rural and Urban area respectively
        -   **Lakdawalla (1993)** - Focused on Calories Intake + Clothing + Shelter
        -   **Suresh Tendulkar Committee (2005-09)** - Committee defined poverty line at monthly per capita expenditure ₹ 816 (rural), ₹ 1000 (urban)
            -   21.9% (All India), **25.7% (Rural India), 13.7% (Urban area) in 2011-12**
            -   Covers food + non food (education, health, electricity and transport)
        -   **C. Rangarajan Committee** suggested poverty line @monthly expenditure for family of five: ₹ 4860 (Rural), ₹ 7035 (Urban) - this report is not accepted (this report covered food, non-food, non-food behaviour such as entertainment etc) - 29.5% were considered poor
        -   To remove any criticism that many poor would be left behind if poverty line as per **Tendulkar committee** is adopted, **NITI Aayog** has underlined that **Tendulkar committee** will only be used to track progress in combating poverty rather than identifying the poor for entitlements. **SECC** data as suggested by **Saxena** and **Hashim committee** will be used for entitlements
        -   **Socio Economic Caste Census 2011**
    -   International:
        -   **World Bank’s International Poverty Line (IPL)** stands at person living daily on **US$1.90 - 21% Indians** below this mark
        -   **MPI by UNDP** is based on a survey with set of 10 questions spread across 3 dimensions viz. health, education and standard of living - **28%** Indians are poor
-   Issues in determining P based on income alone? (**UPSC 2020** question)
    -   Studies such as the **MPI**, **Human Development Index**, and the **Gini coefficient** stresses the need diff dimesions of poverty
    -   Traditionally, poverty refers to lacking enough resources to provide the basic necessities of life – food, clean water, shelter and clothing. But modern economists extend the term to include access to health care, education and even transportation
    -   Other dimensions
        -   **Amartya sen**- Poverty not absence of income rather capability (need for skill dev, edu)
        -   disempowerment politically- migrants
        -   poor quality of work wrt potential- Ex: watchman despite being educated
        -   social exclusion - reserved categories, tribals
        -   **living** in areas that are **environmentally hazardous**
        -   rural-urban disparity
        -   the threat of violence
-   3 Reasons why it is clear that the poverty estimation needs a relook
    -   In 2019, the global **Multidimensional Poverty Index** reported that India lifted 271 million citizens out of poverty between 2006 and 2016 but after that period, there is a downward trend
    -   The last time that ‘India reported an increase in poverty was in the first 25 years after Independence, when from 1951 to 1974, the population of the poor increased from 47% to 56%’. So, India is again a “country of mass poverty” after 45 years. Also there is a fall in the monthly per capita consumption expenditure of 2017-18 for the first time since 1972-73, which the Government withheld citing concerns with the quality of data collected
    -   Hunger issues data, **NFHS-5** data
-   Govt efforts to eradicate P & its evaluations
    -   **Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP)**: assistance to the rural poor in the form of subsidy and bank credit for productive employment opportunities through successive plan periods
    -   **Jawahar Rozgar Yojana**: employment opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed in rural areas through the creation of economic infrastructure and community assets
    -   Green revolution- helped in attaining the food security in country
    -   **Food for Work Programme**: enhancing food security through wage employment(**Garibi hatao** focus)
    -   **Annapurna Scheme**: provide 10 kg of free food grains a month for the eligible senior citizens- target groups of ‘poorest of the poor’ and ‘indigent senior citizens’ who dont have anyone to take care of them
-   Current schemes:
    -   (**MGNREGA**) 2005: 100 days assured employment every year to every rural household( 33% jobs to women), if not provided employment within 15 days- entitled to a daily unemployment allowance from **NREGA Guarantee fund** est be C and S
    -   **National Rural Livelihood Mission: Aajeevika (2011)**: jobs with regular income to rural poor on a monthly basis. Forming Self Help groups etc
    -   Other rural initiatives- **PURA**, **RURBAN** etc
    -   **National Urban Livelihood Mission**: organizing urban poor in Self Help Groups, opportunities for skill development leading to market-based employment , set up self-employment ventures by ensuring easy access to credit
    -   **Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana**: focus on fresh entrant to the labour market
    -   **Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana**: scheme particularly targets the unbanked poor- **DBT** etc
    -   **Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin–PMAY-G)** was launched in 2016- subsidy to low income groups
    -   **PM Svanidhi Scheme**
-   Successes:
    -   **Improvement shown by Bare Necessities Index in ES21**
    -   Steadily improving score on the **Human Development Index**
    -   Between **2006 and 2016, India lifted 271 million people** out of multi-dimensional poverty, which is the fastest in the World, says **UNDP** in 2019
    -   **Reduction in poverty from 45% to 21% (compared to pre NEP 1991)**
    -   Housing for all by 2022 - **more than 1 crore houses built**
    -   **PMJDY** opened 381 million bank accounts (203 mn by women)
    -   Others: **PM-JAY**, **PAHAL Scheme** for cyclinders;
    -   The increase in public expenditure (by 1.5 percentage points from 6.2 to 7.7 per cent of **GDP** during 2014-20) in social sectors including health and education affirms the commitment of the state & central Governments towards maximising social well-being
-   Reasons for failure:
    -   Policy issues- Leakages and corruption in **identification of beneficiaries**, inadequate monitoring
    -   Lack of authentic data — refrained from releasing consumption surveys
        -   Issues wrt diff sections-**inadequate data on migrants**, diff to identify and give benefits to tribals (**Andaman**)
    -   Issues in **poverty line- highly politicised issue** (More people-fiscal issues)- no C,S govt want to accept inc intensity (Multi-D) of poverty
    -   **Plethora of schemes** → Multiplicity → Confusion in implementation or working in silos (**thin distribution of funds across wide schemes** rather than micro targetting)
    -   Issus in schemes- Ex: **MGNREGA** 100 days are not provided in many states, diff in getting unemployment allowance (write other basic issues of schemes- limited finance,bad imp etc)
    -   Socio issues- like **patriachy and caste** based discriminaton wrt identifying beneficaries by gram sabha
    -   Problems of **coordination with govts** at state & local level
-   Way forward (any commitee rec?)
    -   Key to eradicating rural P is **bottom-up agricultural reforms** along with creating productive non-farm emp
    -   **Eco survey 2016-17**- **Quasi-UBI** (**UBI** to most deprived groups- automatically will come above poverty line)- along with other social sector services
    -   **Focusing on Multdim P** - Better nutrition, health, sanitation, skill dev, edu etc
    -   **Micro targeting vulnerable sections**- migrants, manual scavengers, **PVTG** etc
    -   Grassroot level participation rather than imposition of plans (**Panchayat led plans for poverty eraditionarticle 243)**
    -   **KUDUMBASHREE** (poverty eradication and women empowerment programme of **Kerela**)
    -   Enhancing Female- **LF** participation rate (currently only 23%)- lowest in **BRICS**
    -   Ensuring min wage, Social security
    -   Using **ICT** to tackle corruption Ex: **PRAGATI** platform
    -   **How to tackle inequalities** - _The Inequality Virus Report: Oxfam International_
        -   Invest in free universal healthcare, education, and other public services (as they act as foundation to reduce inequality and prevent it to grow further)
        -   Reintroduce wealth taxes and ensure financial transaction taxes
        -   **Invest in a green economy that prevents** further degradation of our planet
    -   Universal Social Security can be provided by leveraging existing schemes such as **PM Garib Kalyan Yojana** and ensure there is no exclusion error (currently there are more than 500 **DBT** schemes of centre, state, other - this needs to be aligned)
    -   Other measures for health, education, **HR** can also be quoted
-   Conclusion: Poverty eradication should not be the goal of the government but goal of the government policies should be to create prosperity.

#### EXTRA CONTENT HUNGER

-   Intro and stats:
    -   **Global Nutrition report 2020**-India is among 88 countries that are likely to miss global nutrition targets by 2025
    -   Adult nutrition- 51% women have anaemia, 20% adult have diabetes
    -   50% of malnourished children of the world are in India
    -   Chief Nutritionist **UNICEF India** termed **malnutrition** as the single gravest threat that blocks India’s development
    -   **Global Hunder Index 2020**: Ranked 94 among 107 countries, far behind countries such as Nepal, **PK**, **BG** (India comes under ‘serious hunger’ category) - 2021 ranked 101 out of 116 countries
        -   Performance on the Indicators: (as per report) (use current status in beginning showing need to do more and improvement as success story later)
            -   Undernourishment: 14% of India’s population is undernourished (2017-19). It was 16.3% during 2011-13.
            -   Child Stunting: 37.9%, it has improved significantly, from 54% in 2000 to less than 35% now.
            -   Child Mortality: 3.7%, it was 5.2% in 2012.
            -   Child Wasting: 20%, it was 15.1% in 2010-14.
    -   Simpler points:
        -   **NFHS-4 (2015-16)** points out that almost half of the pregnant women aged between 15 and 49 years are anaemic and more than one-third of women have a low **Body Mass Index**
        -   38.40% (>one-third) of children under age 5 years are stunted (2015-16)
    -   **Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-18** revealed that over 40 million children are chronically malnourished, and more than half of Indian women aged 15-49 years are anaemic.
    -   Targets under **Poshan Abhiyaan**
        -   Stunting and wasting by 2% a year (total 6% until 2022) among children.
        -   Anaemia by 3% a year (total 9%) among children, adolescent girls and pregnant women and lactating mothers.
        -   The target of the mission is to bring down stunting among children in the age group 0-6 years from 38.4% to 25% by 2022
    -   **SDG 2** - Zero Hunger - End hunger in all forms by 2030 & ensure access to nutritious and sufficient food all year round
    -   **Paradox of Plenty**: India’s food-grain output in 2019-2020 is estimated to be over 290 million tonnes, and as per **World Economic Forum**, India needs approximately 230 million tonnes of food per year to feed its population _(_**_The food crisis of the India/or the world is largely artificial. It is an issue of distribution and not of production_**_)_
    -   Nutrition is key for foundational growth of kids, boosting immunity, in case of girls nutrition there can be **impact of future generations**
-   Causes for Hunger
    -   Poverty: As per **SOFI Report by FAO** - Indian poor cannot afford a nutrient-adequate diet let alone a healthy diet (Basic energy sufficient diet, Nutrient adequate diet and Healthy diet are the three kinds of diets used in the report)
    -   Food wastage
    -   Rising food inflation - making healthy diet unaffordable
    -   Governance issues: Midday Meal crisis in Bihar, **ICDS is affected by lack of trained personnel,** leakage (paradox of plenty- inc production but **leakage/wastage- PDS rice getting exported** in cheap; grains stored via **covered and plinth storage**)
    -   Food, energy and water security are inter-linked with **strong feedback loops**. **Enhancing food security may lead to diminished water and energy security**
    -   Issues of **urban migration**- inaccesibilty to get food from **PDS**
    -   Diversion of agri land to commercial uses- land fragmentation affects self sufficiency of rural population
    -   Effects of climate change- erratic monsoons, droughts affecting agri, famines
    -   Chances of man made conflicts(war) annd natural- **COVID**
    -   **ICDS** services were non functional or severly impacted during **COVID** pandemic
    -   Women more often forego meals to feed their children (**WB**, 60% of those who are hungry are females in India)
-   **Hidden hunger/malnutrition**
    -   Dietary ignorance- not knowing about nutritious food
    -   Inadequate mother education
    -   Obesity- **junk food also malnutritution**- **Non Communicable D’s** (double burden of malnutrition and obesity together)
    -   **Lack of diversity in PDS**- Pulses, millets other protein rich diet absent, inadequate fortified food
    -   **Triple Burden:** Malnutirtion, Obesity, Lack of micro-nutrients (zinc, iron, calcium)
    -   **Inadequate institutional deliveries** in rural, tribal areas - **affect nutrition of new born child**, inadequate breast- feeding
    -   **Lack of inadequate sanitation, illiteracy (i.e poverty not the only cause of H)**
    -   Socio-cultural factors- lack of protien acc to weight requirement due to majorly veg diet in many communities
    -   Malnutrition affects cognitive ability, workforce days and health, impacting as much as 16% of **GDP** (**World Food Programme** and **World Bank**); This with zero hunger we can build a wealthier nation too
-   **Relationship of P and H**
    -   **Life Cycle Approach to Hunger**
        -   Toddler & Infant - Delays brain development & brings illness
        -   Children - Learning difficulties
        -   Adults - Limits earning and working capabilities
        -   Family - Lack of access to meds, food and other necessities for healthy pregancies

    -   If we want to reduce malnutrition and food insecurity, we have to address the problem of affordability of healthy diets
    -   Also talk about schemes related to child health, sanitation - as all these have direct r’ship to parameters such as wasting/stunting
-   Conclusion: **World Food Programme** received **Nobel Peace Prize 2020**; **WFP** says ‘there won’t be peaceful world as long as there is hunger’

#### PYQS RELATING TO POVERTY AND HUNGER

##### POVERTY & HUNGER

-   2020: “The incidence and intensity of poverty are more important in determining poverty based on income alone”. In this context analyse the latest **United Nations Multidimensional Poverty Index Report**.
    -   Incidence- proportion of people who are under the poverty line
    -   Intensity- means multidimensional (weighted average number of deprivations poor people experience at the same time)
    -   Factors other than poverty covered in content below
    -   The **Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)** compares acute multidimensional poverty for 107 countries in developing regions.
    -   Of these people, 1.3 billion people (22%) are identified by the global **MPI** as multidimensionally poor, India is 62nd among 107 countries and **27.91% headcount ratio**
    -   If a person is **deprived in a third or more of ten** (weighted) indicators, the global **MPI** identifies them as ‘**MPI** poor’.
    -   One adult in six is multidimensionally poor compared with one child in three, hence **children are more prone to multidimensional poverty** than adults.
-   2013: Mid-Day Meal: Twin objectives, latest mandates and success
    -   Twin objective: Tackle malnutrition and increase school enrolements
    -   Mandate: provided hot cooked meal having nutritional standards of 450 calories and 12 gm of protein for primary (I- V class) and 700 calories and 20 gm protein for upper primary (VI-VIII class), free of charge
    -   It’s a centrally sponsored scheme launched in 1995
    -   Success:
        -   Increased school enrolments - quote data from education topic
        -   Serving more than 120 mn students’
        -   Better learning outcomes: A total of 72% children who availed mid-day meals in government schools said they could concentrate better on studies after meals (as per **National Institute of Nutrition** survey)
        -   Improved nutritional intake → evidenced by reduced percentage of stunting
        -   Helped break caste barriers as students eat together
-   2017: Efforts taken by **GOI** as of now to tackle both? Measures needed?
-   2015: Though there have been several different estimates of poverty in India, all indicate reduction in poverty levels over time. Do you agree? Critically examine with reference to urban and rural poverty indicators.
    -   Agree and quote domestic as well as international data showing reduction
    -   However issues in govt schemes, multi-dimensionally poverty
    -   Highlight urban and rural poverty status
    -   Issues in eradicating rural poverty- agri,low skills jobs etc
    -   Issues in eradicating urban poverty- Migrant influx, sanitation, slums etc
    -   Poor households of urban India are emerging hotspots for hunger and ill-health and children there live in worse conditions than in rural areas - **UNICEF**
    -   Discuss issues wrt urbanisation such as slums, urbanisation of pandemic
    -   However, rural poverty is different as it suffers from lack of choices
    -   Way forward for both
-   2017: ‘Poverty Alleviation Programmes in India remain mere show pieces until and unless they are backed by political will’. Discuss with reference to the performance of the major poverty alleviation programmes in India.
    -   Covered below along with issues
-   2019: There is a growing divergence in the relationship between poverty and hunger in India. The shrinking of social expenditure by the government is forcing the poor to spend more on non-food essential items squeezing their food-budget – Elucidate
    -   Cover how poverty is reducing using stats
    -   Bring in hidden hunger: Despite increase in real income of the people over the last two decades, overall calorie consumption and nutritional intake has not commensurately increased - mention **Global Hunger Index**
    -   Then substantiate the second statement of the questions:
        -   Expenditure below potential - in various sectors 6% education; 2.5% in health; compared to other **BRICS**
        -   Food Budget Squeeze - due to Inc in expenditure on education,healthcare,transportation,fuel and lighting
        -   Reduced exp by govt has led to urban and the rural poor dependent on market prices → exposing poor to market volatility
        -   Migrants have to spend large portion on travelling, accomodation, etc.
    -   Conclude using way forward points
-   Questions from **GS-1**
    -   2018: ‘Despite implementation of various programmes for eradication of poverty by the government in India, poverty still exists’. Explain by giving reasons.
        -   Limitation of G Schemes wrt poverty has to be covered along with causes of poverty
        -   Reasons for failure covered below in notes
    -   2016: “An essential condition to eradicate poverty is to liberate the poor from deprivation.” Substantiate this statement with suitable examples. (Forms of deprivation and examples to eradicate)
        -   Cover various dimension of poverty using framework of **MPI** and explain how each dimensions leads to poverty (Ex: lack of edu- ignorant- poverty)
        -   Also mentions measures taken in form of schemes by the govt. in each of the above area
        -   Cover way forward in the end
-   2008: The conditions of the urban poor are more deplorable than that of their rural counterparts. Give your views
    -   Urbanisation also complements poverty: one of the principal challenges confronting cities is the staggering number of ‘urban poor’
    -   In India, for several decades post-Independence, elimination of poverty superseded all other priorities of government. There has **massive inc in R-U migration & this phenomenon is universally acknowledged as the urbanisation of poverty**. The visible face of which can be seen from the fact that one in seven among urban areas is living in slums. **Differences among rural and urban poor** are as follows:
        -   In villages, internal distances are small and every village corner is easily accessible. In cities, intra-city travel gets more difficult to negotiate, traffic congestion multiplies - thus need to spend more money **(producitvity also reduced due to pollution - ILO)**
        -   While environment, soil, water resources and forest cover could be under threat on account of production processes in villages, cities are additionally greatly threatened by pollution levels
        -   What really differentiates the **urban poor is the lack of adequate housing** and basic services. Urban poor are also much more deprived in the areas of **sanitation** and infrastructure
        -   **Higher cost of living in urban centres** w/o corresponding increase in income
        -   **Urban crimes** has negative impact on women as well as family values for their children; **Social Anonymity**
        -   Inadequate say in urban governance compared to **Gram sabha** in rural
        -   While within **rural society (rural rich and rural poor) is far less stratified** compared to urban society (urban rich and urbnan poor). Thus the deprivations of poverty, unlike in rural areas, hit the urban poor hard, because they see what the others have and what they don’t. **(psychological - inferiority complex)**
        -   During **COVID**, **urban poor had to face increased risk of getting infected** due to closer settlements, job losses, rural eco not able to absorb them, **Lack of social protection for urban poor** (while rural areas have **PM-KISAN**, **MGNREGA** - nothing like this for urban poor)
        -   Issues of Urban Poverty: **Wage slavery, Lost in the cycle of Informal jobs,** Diversity in regional trends (rising in **UP**, **MP**, **Odisha** and reducing in **GJ**, **Kerela**, **TN**, **PJ**)
    -   **Measures for Urban poor**: **PMAY (Urban)**, **DAY-NULM**, **Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014,** **Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan**, Atal Pension, other insurance schemes, Food grains distribution, **PMSVANidhi**
    -   **WF**: Build a **credible Database of the urban poor** and migrants, along with mapping their skills; Urban planning should be decentralised by focusing on smaller cities and towns. This will lessen the burden of migrant population on megacities; Reform the Urban Governance (by better tech/finance/wider public participation/Convergence and accountability)
    -   Thus, the **past practice** of seeing all poverty in a rural light and **applying rural solutions in urban conditions will not yield the expected results**.
-   2018: Mention core strategies for the transformation of aspirational districts in India and explain the nature of convergence, collaboration and competition for its success. (**Aspirational Districts' Programme**: Objectives - Convergence, Collab and Competition)
    -   **Paradox:** India envisages to become $5 trillion by 2024-25- but not consistent reflected in **UNDP’s Human Development Index** wherein India is ranked 132
    -   India has significant **inter-state and inter-district variations- to remove this heterogeneity**, the government 2018 launced the ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts’ programme (**ADP**).
    -   Features:
        -   The **115 districts** were identified from 28 states, at least one from each state.
        -   Programme is **anchored by NITI Aayog. In addition, individual Ministries to drive the progress** of districts
        -   **ADP** is based on 49 indicators from the **5 identified thematic areas**- Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion & Skill Development, and Basic Infrastructure
        -   With States as the main drivers, **ADP** seeks to focus on the strength of each district, **identify low-hanging fruits for immediate improvement, measure progress, and rank**districts
    -   The broad contours of the programme are:
        -   **Convergence (of Central & State Schemes**) which brings together the horizontal and vertical tiers of the government
        -   **Collaboration** (**of Central, State level ‘Prabhari’ Officers & District Collectors**) which enables impactful partnerships between government, market and civil society
        -   **Competition among districts** driven by a spirit of the mass movement, it fosters accountability on district governments
    -   Impacts
        -   **Decentralization of Development** based on ground realities and targeted welfare
        -   Inclusive approach: uplift those districts which have been shown relatively lesser progress in achieving key social outcomes by using various developement data over the years
        -   Improved Implementation: **Spurred by competition based on outcomes**, local governments target their efforts for imp.
        -   **Health outcomes in ADP** saw an increase in registering pregnant women into the health system, **institutional delivery** of babies
    -   Challenges
        -   **Issues wrt Left wing extremism- creating difficulties in dev prog**
        -   **Issues of federal tensions** in case **unilateral approaches by Niti Aayog**- Ex: in case of states of not ruling party govt, **issues wuth identifying beneficiary**
        -   Might include **political interference in ranking of districts**- what if disctrict **MLA** is cabinet minister
        -   Insufficiency and **lack of complete localised data**: Data high-quality administrative data is critical to improving programme implementation and design at the local level
        -   **The Delta ranking itself is largely focused on assessing quantity (that is, coverage of access) rather than quality.**
        -   _On-time delivery of textbooks in schools are part of the ranking index, However, textbook delivery may or may not be a problem in districts._
        -   Insufficient budgetary resources and other basic points
    -   Way Forward
        -   **A more simplified ranking index- ability to analyse by locals for greater participation (bottom up ranking)**
        -   **Independent surveys** can be used to **validate administrative data,** this will help improve data quality.
        -   **Building** each **district’s internal capacity** to produce reliable and actionable data, and promoting a culture of data use, can be made a priority for the **ADP**.
        -   **Financial autonomy to local governments** should be provided.
        -   Initial evidence suggests that the **ADP** has already **contributed towards improving the lakhs of lives**.
        -   Therefore, it is critical to carefully document and learn from the **ADP’s** experiences
-   2020: **COVID-19** pandemic accelerated class inequalities and poverty in India. Comment.
    -   Intro on **COVID 19**- lockdowns- sudden impact
    -   Class inequalities: **Oxfam Report** - Wealth increase of 10 men during pandemic could buy vaccines for all
    -   Migrants - invisible to govt
    -   Restaurants, movie halls, gyms (**MSME** dominant) closed whereas large captial industries like automobile, food processing limited impact
    -   Education became online which was accessible to privelged few → leading to futher class ineq
    -   Local businesses run by **MSMEs**, Street Vendors, Construction workers — were hurt disproportionately more during **COVID** thus leading to greater divides
    -   Salaried workers who form the backbone of middle class - saw huge job losses
    -   Tech industries flourished- use of zoom call etc- most biz going online- affected offine providers
    -   Agri impact- inc buying of **FMCG** products compared to agri wholesalers (more money to big co’s like **ITC**)
    -   Dual burden on females increased further with all family under one roof
    -   However pandemic showed inc imp of retailers of basic services which have been taken for granted- vegetable seller, dairy, cleaning, newspaper, gas provider etc

        -   Guide other institutes in the country
        -   Better ability of tap univ-industry collab
        -   Cover other challenges of **HEI’s**
        -   Currently they are unable to fill reserved faculty positions for **SC/ST/OBC** (**Over 60% OBC, SC positions vacant in IIMs**) — **IIM/IITs** seek exemption from such faculty quota requirement
    -   Future Challenges
        -   Selection without guidance of govt. may not be inclusive
        -   Lack of uniformity within various institutes
        -   Need to align courses with broad objectives of nation with govt handholding
    -   Way Fwd- Autonomy wrt course and selection (apart from legal req) is prerequisite for quality edu- should be given to all inst apart from premier ones (need for middle path wrt autonomy and need for regulation)
-   2009: How to harmonize private investment and quality of education (context of **Yashpal committee**)
    -   Basic merits and challenges wrt privatisation of edu.
-   Read about **Trend of literacy rate** over the years? State of education in India?
