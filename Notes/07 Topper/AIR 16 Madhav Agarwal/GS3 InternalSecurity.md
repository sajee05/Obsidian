## GS-3 INTERNAL SECURITY

### SYLLABUS

- Linkages between development and spread of extremism
- Challenges to internal security through communication networks, role of media and social networking sites in internal security challenges, basics of cyber security; money-laundering and its prevention
- Cyber Security
- Role of external state and non-state actors in creating challenges to internal security
- Also cover Terrorism here

### PYQS (CATEGORISED AS PER SYLLABUS)

#### 1. EXTREMISM - TERRORISM, NE INSURGENCY, NAXALISM

##### 2019: Role of over-ground workers in spread of extremism; Measures to neutralize them

- **OGW**: Previously only logistics and intelligence, now carrying small strikes.
  - Ex: Kashmir youth ran into army convoy.
- **Role played**:
  - Logistics
  - Managing funding
  - Radicalisation of youths
  - Recruitment
  - Negative perception about state and welfare activities
  - Coordination with other stakeholders (such as OC groups)
- **Measures to neutralise**:
  1.  Public Safety Act, NIA, UAPA use
  2.  Map OGW’s with inter-departmental coordination
  3.  Time spent by youth in jail - monitor and prevent interaction with terrorists
  4.  Track cyberfunding, money laundering
  5.  IB agents in locals act as OGW’s
  6.  Basic development points - job, role model etc.
  7.  Fast track courts - better criminal justice system

##### 2018: Mob violence: causes and consequences, examples

- **Reason for spread of fake news**:
  1.  **Disinformation aka fake news** is driven by **3Ps**: Pursuit of **P**ower, By digital **P**latforms, For **P**rofit motive (clickbaits or spreading propaganda).
  2.  Faster spread of Information.
  3.  No regulator for social media.
  4.  Time consuming process to trace fake news: Studies have shown that correcting and/or debunking takes an average of 12 hours and in 12 hours, a dangerous rumour can travel online several times around the world.
  5.  End to end encryption: Creates the problem in tracking the originator of the message.
  6.  Behavioural issues: Studies have demonstrated that people tend to _circulate falsities far faster than facts_.
  7.  Socio-political reasons: Society is suffering from lack of inclusive social order, rising intolerance and growing polarisation.
  8.  Ex: Palghar Mob lynching.
- **Steps that need to be taken**:
  1.  **RAJIV GAUBA COMMITTEE 2018**:
      -   Social media platforms need to act in ‘time bound manner’ and made accountable for not blocking posts once brought to their notice.
      -   Special task forces to gather intelligence.
      -   Appoint officer in each district at the level of SP.
  2.  Laws on lines on Rajasthan and Mizoram - enact nationally.
  3.  Role of police: Swift response from police. Community policing and other ways of intelligence gathering.
  4.  Role of enforcement authorities: Similarly, enforcement agencies need to develop SOP’s to tackle such situations.
  5.  Role of local authorities: The district administrations and gram panchayats have should be asked to reach out to locals to persuade them against falling for rumours and to come to the authorities if they have any fears.
  6.  Mass awareness: Mass awareness campaigns and outreach is needed in communities - Ex: Delhi poster - of punishment if forwarding hate speech messages.
  7.  Media literacy: The government needs to invest much more resources into education of children and adults alike, in media literacy. Ex: Actor/KOHLI explaining people.
  8.  Posting counter-videos: The one of the method to check fake news is to post counter-videos clarifying the actual position, the other is to register the offences.
  9.  Localisation of data: The government should also ask the social media giants to establish and install servers in India.
  10. **Conclusion**: SC called mob lynching as horrendous acts of mobocracy - insult to democracy.

##### 2015: Terrorism: Solutions, Sources of funding

- **Sources of Funding**:
  1.  Linkage with OC - Extortion, drugs trade (customer service relationship).
  2.  NGO and OGWs.
  3.  FICN used to fund operations and destabilize economy.
  4.  Religious groups and state support (as confirmed by FATF Report).
- **Issues**: _Pending_
- **Global efforts to counter**:
  1.  **UN GLOBAL COUNTER-T COORDINATION COMPACT**: Capacity building of states for Terrorism.
  2.  **TERRORIST TRAVEL INITIATIVE**: Help states develop effective law enforcement for Terrorism capture.
  3.  **CHRISTCHURCH CALL OF ACTION**: NZ attack - cooperation with social media companies to identify extremist content.
  4.  **UNSC 1267 COMMITTEE**.
- **Solutions/Way Forward**:
  1.  **General solutions**:
      -   Development of common definition under **COMPREHENSIVE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM (CCIT)** which marks that _“effective counterterrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals, but complementary and mutually reinforcing”_.
          -   However, this is opposed by USA, OIC group and Latin American countries.
      -   International cooperation in form of extradition treaties to deal with cross border terrorism.
      -   Cutting funding sources: Cooperation with FATF.
  2.  **Conclusion**: Countering terrorism = main focus of our 8th term at UNSC.

##### 2016: “Terrorism is emerging as a competitive industry over the last few decades.” Analyse the above statement.

- Pending as 2016 questions got missed.

##### 2016: The terms ‘Hot Pursuit’ and ‘Surgical Strikes’ are often used in connection with armed action against terrorist attacks. Discuss the strategic impact of such actions.

- Pending as 2016 questions got missed.

##### 2015: Human rights activists constantly highlight the view that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) is a draconian act leading to cases of human rights abuses by the security forces. What sections of AFSPA are opposed by the activists? Critically evaluate the requirement with reference to the view held by the Apex Court.

- _Ans: Covered below_

##### 2019: Indian government has recently strengthened the anti-terrorism laws by amending the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, (UAPA), 1967 and the NIA Act. Analyze the changes in the context of prevailing security environment while discussing scope and reasons for opposing the UAPA by human rights organisations.

- **Recent amendments in UAPA**: The amendment allows government to designate individuals apart from organisation suspected to have terror links as 'terrorists'.
  1.  Apart from investigation by ACP, DCP of Police, Investigation can also be done by officers of NIA (inspector rank and above).
  2.  Permission of seizure of property related to terrorism be taken from DG of NIA (rather than DG of Police).
- **Recent amendments in NIA**: To investigate crimes related scheduled offences - human trafficking, counterfeit currency, dealing in prohibited arms, and cyber-terrorism (which were earlier under state law), officer same power of investigation like police, Special courts for trial of scheduled offences of NIA.
  1.  CG may designate Sessions Courts as Special Courts for the trial of scheduled offences.
  2.  NIA can investigate offences committed outside India, subject to international treaties and domestic laws of other countries.
- **Changes in security environment**:
  1.  Emerging linkage of terrorism with OC called for coherent approach, thus calling for NIA amendment.
  2.  Allow NIA to speed up investigation which was currently delayed by states.
  3.  Members of banned terror groups often form new ‘individual’ outfits → But domestic law did not allow individual designation as terrorists (background of **MASOOD AZHAR** issue).
- **Criticism by HR org**:
  1.  **UAPA**:
      -   State can arbitrarily declare Terrorist without objective grounds - violate Art 14, 19, 21.
      -   **Current Affairs 2021**: Delhi HC redefined the boundaries of Section 15 of the UAPA - Terrorist activity cannot be broadly defined to include ordinary penal offences. By doing so, it raised the bar for the State to book an individual for terrorism under the UAPA.
      -   Violate right to reputation by terming as Terrorist for just possessing books of particular ideology - neglect academic interests, social boycott in future jobs.
      -   Right to dissent - neglect Democracy.
      -   As per MHA data, there has been 72% rise in UAPA cases in 2019 compared to 2015. The conviction rate is mere 2.2%.
      -   Vague definitions Ex: of terrorist act under Section 15 of UAPA - allows misuse.
  2.  **NIA**:
      -   State police - federal issues in investigation.
      -   Use for political motives like CBI.
      -   Take over of case - very subjective - “harming interest of India”.
      -   Already overburdened judiciary.

##### 2016: Reasons for survival of NE insurgency

- _Ans: Write causes for NE insurgency except for historic causes_

##### 2014: Strategies to counter radicalism (posed by multi-religious and multi-ethnic society of India)

- Give status of both - multi religious issues - ISIS recruitment, J&K, Khalistan, Mob lynching.
- Multi ethnic - NE, LWE.
- Strategies - write way forward from LWE, Mob lynching, NE, OGW etc.

##### LEFT WING EXTREMISM: History, Trend, Map, Challenges, Steps taken, Corrective strategies needed to win the LWE doctrine affected citizens; Article 244 and impact of non-implementation of prov of 5th sch on LWE; Also analyse the angle of development of large industries leading to isolation of tribal population (UPSC 2015, 2018 question)

- _All point covered below_

##### 2020: What are the sound determinants of left-wing extremism in Eastern part of India? What strategy should Government of India, civil administration and security forces adopt to counter the threat in the affected areas?

- _Ans: Covered below_

#### 2. ROLE OF EXTERNAL STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS

- **Non state actors**: Insurgents, Maoists, NGO, Terrorist, Social media companies, Religious organizations etc.

##### 2018: CPEC: Description, arguments (repeat in 2014)

- Part of BRI; **CPEC** = Investment in industrial power stations, roads and railways from Kashgar in Xinjiang to Gwadar port.
- **Why India stays away**:
  1.  Sovereignty issues: As its passing through disputed territories Gilgit-Baltistan; Joining would legitimize this.
  2.  No tangible benefits when compared to benefits received from AIIB/SCO (China led), TAPI pipeline.
  3.  Economic trap: Cheque book diplomacy.

##### 2015: ISIS: Religious indoctrination via digital media, Mission, dangers posed

- **ISIS**: Want to establish Islamic state based on Sharia law - recently claimed at establishment province in Kashmir.
- **Why ISIS challenge?**: Pakistan ISI involvement, ISIS losing territory elsewhere, India hotbed of radicalisation - online, communal riots, police injustice to minority, AFSPA.
- **India fight towards ISIS**: Not much influence compared to other countries, Liberal spiritual minority, Fundamental Rights - justice in courts.
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  1.  Gaps in intelligence architecture - NIA less cooperation from state police etc.
  2.  Technical - difficult to ban accounts due to social media company privacy issues.
  3.  Neighborhood challenges.
  4.  NGO’s helping militancy - Foreign interests.
  5.  Other groups - AL-QAEDA maiden video on Kashmir cause.
- **Way Forward**: Big data analytics, RAW-MOSSAD cooperation, Diplomatic (FATF), Deradicalisation (Ex: De-radicalisation drives Ex: Operation Pigeon in Kerala), Development etc. Radicalisation only succeeds when those subjected perceive injustice - we need to reduce these injustices by shaping truly just and egalitarian society.

##### 2014: meaning of airspace and area above it; Implications. challenges, measures (Also cover angle of space weaponisation; Outer space treaty)

#### 3. COMMUNICATION NETWORKS, ROLE OF MEDIA AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES

- Discuss with Ratty - Whether potential threats are similar to different types of cyber crimes.

##### 2018: Data Security: B. N. SRIKRISHNA COMMITTEE REPORT, strengths and weaknesses of the report; Draft bill (comparison)

- Covered below.

##### 2015: National Cyber Security Policy, 2013: Features, challenges in implementation;

- In light of the growth of IT sector in the country - NCSP announced but actual implementation is still short of required.
- **Features**:
  1.  Creating a secure cyber ecosystem, generating trust in IT transactions.
  2.  The **NCIIPC** is to be the nodal agency to protect critical infrastructure, while another 24x7 agency, **CERT-In**, is to coordinate all emergency response and crisis management.
  3.  Creating workforce of 5,00,000 professionals in the field.
  4.  Fiscal benefits for businessman who accepts standard IT practices, etc.
  5.  Indigenous technological solutions need to be developed to reduce reliance on foreign software. Testing of ICT products and certifying them.
  6.  All organisations should designate a **CISO** and allot a security budget.
- **Criticism of policy**:
  1.  Mainly covers defensive and responsive measures - no mention of offensive capability.
  2.  The policy avoids addressing privacy vs security, censorship vs freedom of speech.
  3.  Most of the cyber crimes are expected to be dealt with by the local police under state government in combination with outside consultants. No efforts are taken to upgrade skills of local police.
  4.  NCSP is silent on dealing with threats emanating from new technologies - need to update policy regularly.
  5.  CSP fails to address the overreach of state in cyberspace. Further, with state outsourcing to private companies to build systems for mass surveillance, there is every chance of private data falling into wrong hands - Aadhar issue.
  6.  India less CS workforce whereas China has around 5 lakh personnel.

##### 2013: Cyber warfare? India’s preparedness? Need for Digital Armed Force

- **RICHARD A. CLARKE**, in his book **CYBER WAR** (May 2010) - “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.” The Economist describes cyber warfare as “the fifth domain of warfare,”.
- **Example**: North Korean beagle boys attacking India/US etc. banks for funding **KIM JONG UN** regime.
- **Types**: Direct critical infrastructure warfare by states, Misinformation campaign (Russian bots in US elections), private efforts with state help - Intellectual property theft (collaboration of PLA and Chinese university).
- **India’s preparedness** (take points from measures too):
  1.  Defence cyber agency.
  2.  Non state/covert expertise - 2010 Indian cyber army group attacked Pakistan all ministry websites, army websites for 26/11 revenge.
  3.  NCIIPC - protects critical infrastructure, other institutions, CERT-In 24/7 security etc.
  4.  5th Global conference on cyber space in India 2019 for private, international collaboration.
- **Way forward**:
  1.  Cyber diplomacy - cooperation on cyber intelligence like traditional international cooperation RAW, MOSSAD.
  2.  Collaboration with private sector to protect infrastructure - Ex: telecom sector.
  3.  Use AI to detect cyber warfare attempts like US.
  4.  Recruitment for Digital armed force from IIT/NIT’s.
  5.  Evolve international agreements to prevent excessive cyber warfare but be prepared for eventuality.

#### 5. MONEY LAUNDERING AND ITS PREVENTION

##### 2013: Significance? Steps required?

- [Money Laundering: GS-3 Internal Security](https://quip.com/jN38AhSpo4NN#fRIACAN8llN)

#### 6. BORDER SECURITY - CHALLENGES, MANAGEMENT

##### 2020: For effective border area management, discuss the steps required to be taken to deny local support to militants and also suggest ways to manage favourable perception among locals

- **Steps to deny local support to militants**:
  1.  Funding channels from local sources need to be checked.
  2.  Check social media sites helping local recruitment.
  3.  Breaking means used to radicalise the youth.
  4.  Using technology.
  5.  Intelligence gathering of local involved.
  6.  Try to reform local instead of harsh punishment - will prevent vicious cycle of recruitment - elder brother killed, younger joins.
  7.  Cooperation between police forces and border guarding forces.
  8.  Augmenting state forces by centre.
- **Ways to manage favourable perception among locals**:
  1.  Ideological - Intelligence agents helping to change perception to pro-country.
  2.  Role model - IAS, IPS rewarded in front of youth.
  3.  Better welfare in border areas - Education, health.
  4.  Minimise Internet shut down to prevent alienation of youth.
  5.  Bringing luxuries of metro cities - amusement parks, movie cinemas, sports recruitment (Ex: J&K player in Indian team/IPL).

##### 2020: Analyze internal security threats and transborder crimes along Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan borders including line of Control (LoC). Also discuss the role played by various security forces in this regard

- _Covered below; Role of security forces covered separately (write positive role played with way forward for issues faced by them)_

##### Border issues with all neighbours (porous borders) along with solutions

##### 2013: South Asia and Myanmar: Challenges and solutions

- _Covered below_

##### 2014: Strategies to counter illegal trans-border migration; reasons for such migration

- **Reasons**:
  1.  Better economic opportunities, poor can't afford visa.
  2.  China, Pakistan border better secured but Nepal open border, Bangladesh - not properly secured.
  3.  Migrants fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka (Tamils), Rohingya.
- **Impacts**: Analyse on PESTEL.
  1.  Changed demographics of states - political power, name in voting list, resistance from states.
  2.  Jobs of local people in jute mills, Wages pushed down due to increase in labour.
  3.  Encroachment of farmland (disguised employment), urban slums.
  4.  Religious extremism.
  5.  Positive impacts - Improvement in agriculture in West Bengal, cheap labour but harms outweigh benefits as India already populated.
- **Strategies to counter/way forward**:
  1.  Similar to border management such as fencing, use of technology.
  2.  Greater role of locals in intelligence, prevent land purchase by migrants, prevent getting their name on voter’s list.
  3.  Cooperation on diplomatic front; Providing development assistance.
  4.  Simplify procedure for legal migration Ex: Temporary work permits, Concession on fees subject to conditions.
  5.  Exclusive migration law to gather data and ensure deterrence.
  6.  Importance of data - NRC.

##### 2014: Various maritime & coastal security concerns including piracy; measures taken, way forward

- _Covered below_
- **Piracy challenges**: Significances written below.
- **Piracy way forward**: International cooperation, UN framework to multi-cooperation, international aid for Somalia development, political stability, Navy coordination.

##### 2016: Border management is a complex task due to difficult terrain and hostile relations with some countries. Elucidate the challenges and strategies for effective border management.

- Pending as added later.

#### 7. LINKAGES OF ORGANIZED CRIME WITH TERRORISM

##### 2018: India’s proximity to two of the world’s biggest illicit opium-growing states has enhanced her internal security concerns. Explain the linkages between drug trafficking and other illicit activities such as gunrunning, money laundering and human trafficking. What countermeasures should be taken to prevent the same?

- **Introduction**: India lies between Golden Crescent on the west and Golden Triangle in the east (India has become both destination and transit).
- **Possible ways they are linked**:
  1.  Financial channel use, IT expertise use.
  2.  Using cross border routes of drug trafficking to facilitate Human Trafficking, gun smuggling.
  3.  Fund generated from Human Trafficking, Drugs requires money laundering.
  4.  Youth on drugs - easy prey for Terrorists, Human Trafficking, need guns for domestic use - promote arms smuggling.
  5.  Same linkages of all OCs with authorities - use of each other contacts Ex: custom and drug mafia - blackmail - arms smuggling too.
  6.  Barter system with one another.
- Give examples from Eastern, Western and Myanmar, sea borders.
- **Countermeasures**:
  1.  _Written below_
  2.  Recommendation of **MADHUKAR GUPTA COMMITTEE** (discussed in Challenges from Pakistan).

##### 1985: Drug abuse and drug addiction: Challenges, steps for victims

- **Introduction**: AIIMS - “Magnitude of Substance Use in India” to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.
  1.  Around 5 crore Indians reported to have used cannabis and opioids at the time of the survey.
  2.  **Punjab** followed by West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.
- **Reasons**:
  1.  **Stress Buster**: Studies or work pressure, an unemployed youth.
  2.  **Peer pressure**: Glamour attached to drug taking, youth from other state in metropolitan cities, social media.
  3.  **Flaws in the legal system**: Unable to tackle drug cartels, crime syndicates and ultimately the **ISI** which is the **biggest supplier of drugs**.
  4.  Smuggling of drugs - neighbouring countries.
- **Challenges**:
  1.  Legally available drugs such as tobacco are a huge problem.
  2.  Currently, the country has more of the young population with disposable income where willingness to take risk is high. The availability of drugs in the country makes it a lethal mix.
  3.  Lack of availability of rehabilitation centres.
  4.  Stigma attached to mental health, drug abuse.
- **Way Forward**:
  1.  Tackle cause rather than act - Mental health issues, vicious cycle leading to increase of depression.
  2.  Voluntary support as well as support from physicians, psychologists, family is required.
  3.  Society needs to understand that drug-addicts are victims and not criminals.
  4.  Strict action is required from police officers at the excise and narcotics department to curb the problem of drug menace in the country.
  5.  Radical political decisions like that one of alcohol prohibition in Bihar may be another solution. When people do not exercise self-control, a state has to step in, as part of the Directive Principles of State Policy (Article 47).
  6.  Education curriculum should include chapters on drug addiction, its impact and also on de-addiction. Proper Counselling is another alternative.
  7.  Strictly implement the **NARCOTIC DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES (NDPS) ACT**.

### BASICS OF CYBER SECURITY

- **Facts**:
  -   Cybercrimes increased by 63.5% in 2019 compared to 2018 - NCRB Report.
  -   According to McAfee report, India ranked 5th in terms of ecommerce security breaches - alarming as India terms as software capital of the world. Cost of downtime 30 crore a day if cyber security attack on public infrastructure.
  -   FBI Report 2019 - India 3rd among Top 20 that are victim of cyber crimes.
  -   Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) remarked that cyber crimes increased by 500% during the pandemic.
- **Meaning of CS**:
  -   As per _Section 2 of IT Act 2000_ - CS means protecting equipment/computer/communication devices/information stored therein from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.
- **Significance and Need**:
  -   3rd largest internet users in the world (700 million ➡➡ 974 million by 2025).
  -   Strong government impetus towards e-governance (may bring personal data under public domain) - Digital India mission.
  -   Large percentage of exports are IT centric (software capital).
  -   Recent cyberattacks on nuclear plants etc (1 Cyber attack in every 10 min) - Critical Infrastructure - power grids, vaccine data systems.
  -   Start up push (India 3rd largest in world for tech startup).
  -   Cyber insecurity of individuals, organisation and states rose in time of COVID-19.
    -   Largely due to increase in screen time.
- **Types of cyber threats**:
  -   **Cyber crimes**:
    -   Identity theft - steal personal info - FB Cambridge Analytica.
    -   Israel Pegasus spyware on whatsapp; Kundunkulam attack by ‘Dtrack’, PMO Twitter account hack.
    -   Denial of service attacks, Child sexual offences, Cyberstalking, Cyberbullying.
    -   **Cyber defamation**: It is defamation by anything which can be read, seen or heard with the help of computers.
    -   **Corporate smear**: It is a false rumour about a company, its management or its stock that is posted on the Internet. This is bad for business.
  -   **Cyber terrorism**:
    -   By non state actors - **OSAMA** 9/11 stock market use for Terrorism.
    -   Threat to India’s nuclear plants, Power grids, Critical security infrastructure.
    -   Christchurch attack.
  -   **Cyber warfare**:
    -   By state actors - emerging as 5th domain of warfare.
    -   Value of traditional deterrents such as land size GDP size have become less (as even small island nations can engage in cyber warfare).
    -   Cyber tensions between US-China, Russia involvement in Trump election, Attack by US and Israel on Iran nuclear program.
    -   Alleged attack by Chinese firm on India’s power system and ports in Oct 2020 (as per US Firm’s Report).
- **Challenges**:
  -   Digital illiteracy: _Write fact if any;_ Lack of digital hygiene where people click suspicious emails/texts.
  -   Shortage of trained workforce: Required 10 lakh vs current state 62k (as per analyst estimates).
  -   Imported equipments: Dependence as high as 70% ~ prone to ‘backdoor’ vulnerabilities - mostly from China - Huawei issue recently.
  -   Lack of comprehensive data protection law.
  -   International vulnerability - US PRISM program - collects international communication of domestic/foreign citizens from FB, google - highlighted by **SNOWDEN**; Wikileaks highlighted that CIA has advanced capabilities with which it can leave ‘false finger prints’ confusing investigators to lead to other nation states rather than USA.
  -   Aadhar card breach of UIDAI chief on twitter by French Hacker - shows institutional vulnerability.
  -   Lack of coordination among institutions: Blame game and turf wars between groups whereas cyberspace has no boundaries; Private sector playing limited role (overlapping responsibilities fails to create proper accountability).
  -   Low reporting of cybercrimes.
  -   Economic challenges: Ex: Posed by bank mergers - difference in security softwares - threats are increased.
  -   Technocracy - Increased power of Twitter, FB - banning of people of one ideology Ex: **DONALD TRUMP** - sets dangerous precedent.
  -   Major resources of nations are concentrated to protect military & strategic targets, but the civilian infrastructure such as healthcare system is also under attack (as evident from attacks during pandemic).
  -   Sophistication of cyber crimes - Pegasus spyware could be installed with just Whatsapp missed call (zero click attack).
- **Measures taken**:
  -   **Institutional**:
    -   **Under PMO**:
      -   **NATIONAL INFORMATION BOARD (NIB)** is apex policy-making wing on cyber security headed by NSA.
      -   Office of **NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY COORDINATOR** was established in 2015 to advice PM on strategic CS issues.
      -   For Critical Infrastructure: **NATIONAL CRITICAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION CENTRE (NCIIPC)** which comes under NTRO is mandated to battle cyber security threats in strategic CII such as air control, nuclear and space (NTRO comes under PMO).
    -   For Non-Critical Infrastructure: **CERT-In** = National nodal agency for CS under Meity; There are sectoral CERTs as well such as CERT-Fin.
      -   **CYBER SWACHHTA KENDRA** is operated by CERT-In.
    -   **Under Defence Ministry**: The **DEFENCE CYBER AGENCY** (w.e.f. 2019) is a tri-service command of the Indian Armed Forces tasked with handling cyber security threats.
    -   **Under Ministry of Home**: (there are many other bodies as well)
      -   **INDIAN CYBER CRIME COORDINATION CENTRE (I4C)**: The I4C will assist in centralising cyber security investigations, prioritise the development of response tools and bring together private companies to contain the menace.
      -   **NATIONAL CYBER CRIME REPORTING PORTAL (NCCRP)** is citizen-centric initiative portal to report any cyber crime; Special emphasis is for children, women.
    -   Apart from this MEA coordinates India’s cyber diplomacy push at international forums.
  -   **Awareness**:
    -   **NATIONAL SECURITY DIRECTIVE** issued by Cabinet Committee on Security which aims to classify telecom products and their sources under the ‘trusted’ and ‘non-trusted’ categories based on the methodology developed by National Cyber Security Coordinator.
    -   **CYBER SURAKSHIT BHARAT** - for cyber hygiene among citizens.
    -   Asked all telecom operators to undertake **‘information security audit’** of their networks to check for any ‘backdoor’ or ‘trapdoor’ vulnerabilities.
    -   '_RBI_ Kehta Hai' Campaign to improve.
  -   **Legislative**:
    -   **DRAFT PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION BILL, 2018** (based on the recommendation of Justice **B.N. SRIKRISHNA COMMITTEE**) to secure citizens data.
    -   **INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT, 2000** (amended in 2008) to provide a legal framework for transactions carried out by means of electronic data interchange, for data access for cybersecurity etc.
    -   **NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY POLICY 2013**.
  -   **International**:
    -   **Status**: US wants militarisation of digital space, others resisting.
    -   **PARIS CALL**: For common principles of Cyber Security - but countries differences on cyber security with respect to role of private sector - west wants private, China, Russia wants state control.
    -   **BUDAPEST CONVENTION**: Sole legally binding International treaty to protect against cyber crimes, provides power and procedures, international cooperation.
      -   India - not joined due to data intrusion by tech companies, other states.
    -   India recently voted in favour of a Russian-led UN resolution to set up a separate convention as an opposition to Budapest convention.
- **Way Forward**:
  -   A committee set up by the IRDAI has recommended the introduction of a cyber insurance policy - need to be expedited.
  -   There is a need for institutional coherence (jargon which means coordination 😛) along with doctrinal clarity (Currently there is no single doctrine which guides all players in CS space; A doctrine on lines of ‘no first use’ in nuclear space is needed to guide everyone) - A clear doctrine can boost citizen confidence, build trust among allies and clearly signal intent to potential adversaries.
  -   Need for effective 24/7 well trained cyber police, adhere to cyber security standards for government, private processes - Ex: ISO guidelines for CS management.
  -   Need to develop domestic capabilities Ex: through schemes such as Production Linked Incentives.
  -   Cyber forensics, security audits of government, private organizations.
  -   Cyber deterrence (offensive + defensive), Cyber diplomacy.
  -   Enhanced international cooperation.
  -   Promote cyber hygiene of citizens.
  -   **UDAY KOTAK COMMITTEE** - recommended Risk management and IT committee: Top-500 listed companies should have risk management committee of boards for cyber security.
  -   Skill building of youth needs to be tapped as they play big role in devising cyber security solutions to effectively vaccinate digital products against viruses and cyberattacks Ex: through MOOC courses, partnership with reputed institutes.
  -   Standing Committee on IT chaired by **RAO INDERJIT SINGH** recommended reducing government dependence of foreign cloud servers.
  -   Data protection law - Effective implementation.
  -   Social media companies - Should not turn democracy into technocracy.
  -   Email Accounts of Employees belonging to IGCAR, BARC, SEBI, ISRO were hacked and the data provided in plain text over dark web; Its high time government **two-factor authentication** is introduced in email accounts of Employees of sensitive organisations.
- **Conclusion**: In the age of digital interdependence, technology is inseparable so insurance for cyber risks only way.

##### 2020: Discuss different types of cyber crimes and measures required to be taken to fight the menace

- _Ans: Both covered above_

##### 2016: Potential threats, Security framework to control cyber crime

- _Ans: Both covered above;_ Potential threats - write using type of cyber threats.

##### 2018: Data Security: B. N. SRIKRISHNA COMMITTEE REPORT, strengths and weaknesses of the report; Draft bill (comparison)

- **Ans: Key features of the 2019 Bill**:
  -   **Personal data** (data that can identify an individual): Various types such as Critical personal data, Sensitive personal and General personal data.
  -   **Applicability**: Processing of personal data by Government, companies incorporated in India and foreign companies dealing with personal data of individuals in India; Processing of data by fiduciaries only if consent is provided by the individual.
  -   **Obligations of data fiduciary** (an entity or individual who collects and decides the means and purpose of processing personal data):
    -   Personal data can be processed only for specific, clear and lawful purpose.
    -   Transparency and accountability measures such as security safeguards and instituting grievance redressal mechanisms.
  -   **Rights of the data principal** (the individual whose data is being collected and processed):
    -   Obtain confirmation from the fiduciary on whether their personal data has been processed.
    -   Right to be forgotten which will allow users to erase their personal data published online.
    -   Restrict continuing disclosure of their personal data by a fiduciary, if it is no longer necessary or consent is withdrawn.
  -   **Data Protection Authority**: Which may take steps to protect interests of individuals, prevent misuse of personal data and ensure compliance with the Bill.
  -   Central government may direct data fiduciaries to provide it with **any non-personal data** and **anonymized personal data** for better targeting of services.
  -   **Transfer of data outside India**:
    -   Critical personal data can must be stored _and_ processed only in India.
    -   Sensitive personal data must be stored within India but can be copied elsewhere provided certain conditions are met.
    -   Personal data other than sensitive and critical personal data don’t have such localisation mandates.
- **Criticism of the Bill**:
  -   **Deviance from Justice B.N. SRIKRISHNA committee**:
    -   Data Protection Authority’s composition is dominated by the government, as contrasted with the diverse and independent composition.
    -   Blanket power of exemption from all provisions of the law (including access to personal data without consent, citing national security, investigation and prosecution of any offence, public order) in favour of a government agency.
      -   Section 35 uses the words when “necessary or expedient” → it should be replaced with “necessary and proportionate” (**PUTTASWAMY JUDGEMENT**).
  -   **Other criticism**:
    -   The bill stipulates that social media intermediaries allow for the **voluntary verification of their accounts** by **any users** who use their services from India or register from within India. However, the proof users need to submit to the social media intermediary to verify their accounts is unclear. No other country has the provision for a voluntary verification mechanism of this nature.
    -   Section 91—a provision clarifying that government reserves the right to interpret any policies for the benefit of India’s digital economy - as long as this does not involve the use of personal data that can be directly used to identify an individual.
- **Current Status**:
  -   Bill under scrutiny of Joint Committee.
  -   For detailed clause by clause comparison: [https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/personal-data-protecti](https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-how-it-differs-draft-bill) [on-bill-2019-how-it-differs-draft-bill](https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-how-it-differs-draft-bill).
  -   Weakness of draft (UPSC) - Now focus on bill.

#### NON PERSONAL DATA - KRIS GOPALAKRISHNAN COMMITTEE (_Unlike the above bill which focuses on personal data this is NPD_)

- **GOPALAKRISHNAN COMMITTEE** has taken an **infrastructural view of data**. (below points explain this statement)
  -   Data collected from various communities are considered to be ‘owned’ by the relevant community. Such ‘community ownership’ means that the data should be shared back with all those who need it in society, whether to develop domestic digital businesses or for producing important digital public goods.
  -   Infrastructures are to be equitably provided for all businesses. Data have similar characteristics. What is needed, however, is to treat data as infrastructure, or ‘commons’, so that data are widely available for all businesses.
- **Recommendations**:
  -   Suggested that non-personal data generated in India be allowed to be harnessed by various domestic companies and entities.
  -   Suggested a separate national legislation and a separate authority to oversee non-personal data.
  -   Classified non-personal data into three main categories:
    -   **Public non-personal data**: It involves all the data collected by the government and its agencies during execution of all publicly funded works.
      -   Ex: Census, data collected by municipal corporations on the total tax receipts.
    -   **Community non-personal data**: It involves any data identifiers about a set of people who have either the same geographic location, religion, job, or other common social interests.
      -   Ex: The metadata collected by ride-hailing apps, telecom companies, electricity distribution companies.
    -   **Private non-personal data**: It can be defined as those which are produced by individuals which can be derived from application of proprietary software or knowledge. Ex: data generated by companies like Google, Amazon etc.
- **Importance of NPD**: Use for targeted delivery of service; Useful for Indian entrepreneurs to develop new and innovative services or products.
- **Issues**: No clarity over grievance redressal; Favours big tech companies, IPR issues.
- **Way Forward**: Like many other countries, India too will have to define non-personal data in a manner that protects intellectual property rights, serves genuine public interest and promotes innovation.

### MONEY LAUNDERING

- **Definition/Meaning**:
  -   According to INTERPOL **Money laundering** is concealing the identity of ‘proceeds of crime’ and projecting it as ‘untainted property’.
  -   In simpler terms converting dirty money into clean money using complex processes.
- **Objectives**: Hide criminal activities; Avoid tax scrutiny while using the laundered money (round tripping).
- **Tools used**: Smurfing (Dividing amount into smaller amounts), Hawala transactions (remittance without physical movement of cash), Currency exchange, Shell companies, Fake investment, Fake invoices, Real estate investment, using cryptocurrency for ML.
- **3 staged process** of ML: _Refer images below_
  -   ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 4.jpeg>)
  -   ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 5.jpeg>)
  -   **Placement**: Deposit money into financial institutions.
  -   **Layering**: Several bank-bank transfers, most complex making it hard to trace.
  -   **Integration**: Money reenters mainstream economy in legitimate form, difficult to catch here in this stage if not caught in previous 2.
- **Impacts of ML**:
  -   **Economic**:
    -   Tax evasion, volatility in markets, inflationary spiral, parallel economy.
    -   Corruption, Black money laundered.
    -   Policy distortion.
    -   Impacting FDI and investor confidence.
    -   Tax avoidance - welfare programs.
  -   **Political**:
    -   Financing terrorism, drug trafficking (Golden Triangle/Crescent), arms smuggling, antiques, environmental illegal trade etc.
    -   Using NGOs to hamper developmental projects by external actors with vested interests.
  -   **Social**:
    -   Continuance of crimes and disharmony in society.
    -   Promotion of culture of bribery among officials → Impacts Ease of Doing Business.
    -   Hawala culture - increase chances of fraud in society.
  -   **International**:
    -   Decline in credibility of sovereign bonds - Ex: Pakistan after being on the grey list.
- **Challenges in tackling ML**:
  -   Reluctance on part of countries to share info Ex: Switzerland, Tax havens such as Cayman Islands.
  -   Sheer volume in India’s banking system.
  -   The legal framework are not able to match up with the speed of growing technologies.
  -   Lax attitude of banking staff towards influential & powerful people promotes ML (Ex: they do not exercise KYC norms properly).
  -   Golden nexus between _you know who_.
  -   Weak and fragmented enforcement architecture having separate agencies to deal with ML, cyber crimes, terror crimes, etc.
- **Steps taken**:
  -   **International**:
    -   **FATF** is an intergovernmental body established by the G7 summit in Paris in 1989 and responsible for setting global standards on anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism; Regular reviews are done under FATF.
      -   New-age challenges before FATF: Challenges to the global counter-terror and anti money laundering regime: including bitcoins and cyber currencies, illegal trafficking of wildlife as a source of funding, use of artificial intelligence in terror attacks and biowarfare as part of the wider challenge of the coronavirus pandemic.
    -   **UN CONVENTION TRANS NATIONAL AGAINST ORGANISED CRIME (UNTOC)**, **UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION** w.e.f. 2005 - Both widen the scope of ML by applying to TOC, C and urge states to create regulatory regime to combat.
    -   **BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING (BEPS)** initiative, under which the countries have agreed to take necessary measures. Initiative by OECD.
    -   The **INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF SECURITIES COMMISSIONS (IOSCO)**: It encourages its members to take necessary steps to combat Money Laundering in securities and futures markets.
  -   **Domestic efforts**:
    -   Criminalised money laundering under the **PMLA, 2002**.
    -   Criminalised money laundering under **NARCOTIC DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES ACT, 1985 (NDPS ACT)**, as amended in 2001.
    -   **ENFORCEMENT DIRECTORATE (ED)** for investigation and prosecution of cases under the PMLA.
    -   **FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT – INDIA (FIU-IND)** for receiving, processing, analysing and disseminating information relating to suspect financial transactions.
    -   **CERT-Fin** on lines of CERT-In.
- **Way forward**:
  -   Several countries impose tougher monitoring norms on bank accounts operated by persons holding important position in government, bureaucracy or their relative - i.e. check neglect of KYC norms.
  -   Adhere to all standards of FATF in letter and spirit both mandatory and optional.
  -   Co-ordination between investigating agencies like ED, CBI, NCB in case of TOC linkages.
  -   Use of AI, Data mining for analysis on ML.
  -   Speedy trial under special courts of PMLA.
  -   Explore treaties on line of US FATCA with other countries for info on ML by Indians.
  -   Weeding out the black sheep NGOs (focused and proportionate measures, in line with the risk-based approach).

#### PMLA

- **PMLA** - core of legal framework for ML from 2002, provides for confiscation of proceeds of crime.
- **PMLA, 2012**:
  -   Law links the provisions of Indian law with the laws of foreign countries.
  -   Adds the concept of reporting entity which would include a banking company, financial institution, business or profession.
  -   The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 levied a fine up to Rs. 5 lakh. The amendment act removed this upper limit.
  -   The act has provided for provisional attachment and confiscation of property it has reason to believe that the offence of money laundering has taken place.
- **PMLA, 2018**:
  -   Amendment in definition of “proceeds of crime”: It now allows the ED to proceed against assets of equivalent value located even outside the country.
  -   Corporate frauds: Corporate frauds is being included as scheduled offence under PMLA, so that Registrar of Companies can report such cases for action by Enforcement Directorate for money laundering probe. (**NIRAV MODI, VIJAY MALLYA, MEHUL CHOKSI**).

##### 2013: Money laundering poses a serious security threat to a country’s economic sovereignty. What is its significance for India and what steps are required to be taken to control this menace?

- _Ans: Economic Impacts covered above; Way ahead covered above_

### COMMUNICATION NETWORKS, ROLE OF MEDIA AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES

- **Communication Network**: CN part of our critical information infrastructure which was defined in the IT Act, 2000 as “the computer resource, the incapacitation or destruction of which, shall have debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health or safety.”
- **Significance**:
  -   Crucial to the connectivity of other critical infrastructure, viz. telecom, civil aviation, shipping, railways, power, nuclear, banking, intelligence agencies, space, defence, and government networks.

  -   Hardware/software from abroad - Huawei China issue.
  -   Much of infrastructure in private hands - see security auditing etc. adding to their costs.
  -   PNB-SWIFT issue **NIRAV MODI** - neglect of critical infrastructure for risk management.
- **Way forward**:
  -   Domestic production of telecom equipment Ex: Reliance 5G.
  -   Electronic devices domestic production funds by Meity.
  -   Expertise by CERT-In to security agencies, better analytical capability, secured intra government communication network, data protection etc.
  -   Write measures of cyber security management (above).
- **Media**:
  -   **Positive Role**:

    -   Busting propaganda spread by LWE.
    -   4th pillar of Democracy, inform and educate people (Corona), bridge between people and government.
    -   Hathras coverage - make public servants accountable.
  -   **Negative Role/ Challenges to IS**:
    -   Coverage of security operations - ending up helping Terrorist Groups Ex: 26/11 attacks.
    -   Irresponsible coverage of communal conflicts → Polarising the society further.
    -   Paid news - Supporting vested interests rather than truth.
    -   Media Trials - Impacts psychology of the person targeted (**SSR** case).
  -   **Need for self-regulation**:
    -   Just like Freedom of Speech & Expression, media also has reasonable restrictions - decency, morality, public order, defamation, security of India.

    -   Partnership to lift up tribals Ex: **GOAL (GOING ONLINE AS LEADERS)** - Ministry of Tribal Affairs + FB.
    -   Social movements - Environmental, **GEORGE FLOYD**, Feminist - things that TV media ignores.
  -   **Negative Role**:
    -   Business model of SM - advertisement scrolling - hardens beliefs - threat to peace Ex: US, India political divisions.
    -   Post truth world - Spread of fake news and hate message.
    -   Subversion of democratic process Ex: Cambridge Analytica.
    -   Identity theft and sell of personal data - Hampers fundamental rights.
    -   Used by extremists to fund, recruit, spread propaganda, train, execute (Christchurch incident).
    -   Cyber bullying and pornography.
    -   Excessive power to tech companies - selective blocking of content.
  -   **Challenges**:
    -   Balancing between freedom of speech vs internal security.

    -   Challenges covered under cyber security above.
  -   **Government efforts to counter Internal security challenges**:
    -   Messaged to not forwards hateful content otherwise penal action - Delhi government.
    -   Cooperation with social media companies - block fake, hateful content fast (Ex: whatsapp limit on forwarding).
    -   **RAJIV GAUBA COMMITTEE** recommended on making social media platforms accountable.
    -   Banning porn, child pornography, blue whale games.
    -   Chinese apps as threat to national security - PUBG, TikTok.
  -   **Way forward**:
    -   Youth sensitisation - demographic dividend should not become disaster - attached to TikTok, Instagram.
    -   Awareness for facts based content and not biased content.
    -   International cooperation to block extremist content.

### LINKAGES BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND SPREAD OF EXTREMISM

- **How are they linked? Two Schools of thought**:
  -   Extremism is the cause and Development is the effect — calls for Law & Order approach.
  -   Development is the cause and Extremism is the effect — calls for Development approach.

### LEFT WING EXTREMISM (LWE)

- **History and goal of LWE**:
  -   Started with 1967 Naxalbari, Believer in Marx idea of overthrow of state and establishment dictatorship of proletariat.
  -   Claims to represent most oppressed untouched by India’s development.
- **Trend**:
  -   From 200+ districts in 2004 ➡➡ 160 in 2014 ➡➡ 90 in 2019.
  -   Currently, 30% districts account for 90% violence by LWE.
  -   Entry in newer areas such as Kerala (while reduction in older areas).
  -   ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 6.jpeg>)
- **Good statements for LWE**:
  -   Red Corridor (from Pashupati to Tirupati).
  -   _‘Discontent’_ provided fertile ground for spread of LWE.
  -   From Friction to Fusion (subtitle of 2nd ARC).
  -   _2nd ARC 7th Report - Mixture of ‘police stick’ and ‘development carrot’ as panacea to tackle LWE_.
  -   Success story of AP: Grey Hounds + balance between development and Law & Order approach (suggest as role model).
- ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 7.jpeg>)
- **Recent attacks**: Naxals blew up a bus using landmine in Narayanpur district (Chhattisgarh), killing 5 policemen.
- **Causes/determinants**:
  -   **Land Related Issues**:
    -   _Why Land is important? Primary factor of production in agriculture + cultural significance_.
    -   Displacement: As per PC Report 2008, >40% displaced = tribals of which 70% not rehabilitated.
    -   Eviction from forests: Done through Forest Conservation Act 1980.
      -   → Disrupted age old tribal-forest relationship, excessive power to forest bureaucracy.
    -   Land alienation by zamindars, money lenders, private contractors; Poor implementation of laws prohibiting transfer from tribal to non-tribal.
    -   Illegal mining (resource curse).
    -   Non fulfilment of post independence land reform commitment.
  -   **Socio-Economic Reasons**:
    -   Poverty Ex: Kareem Nagar (Telangana) 95% compared to state average 50%.
    -   No access to basic resources Ex: 2% rural houses have clean tap water in Dantewada.
      -   In the guard of protecting their culture & traditions - roads were not made.
    -   Lack of minimum wages despite Act, Higher wages promised by Naxals (by pressurising industrialists) gives legitimacy to LWE.
    -   Social - Untouchability, bonded labour - mixing of caste and class issues.
  -   **Poor implementation of constitutional & legal provisions**:
    -   Article 244/Schedule V _(UPSC Question 2013)_.
      -   Tribal Advisory Council (TAC) either not formed or recommendations not implemented by Governor.
      -   TAC coopted in the system - more tribal injustice.
      -   Governor’s report never debated in Parliament - leading to substandard functioning.
      -   Schedule gives power to Governor to make regulation to prevent land alienation; could not prevent land grab by non tribals.
      -   Lack of resources with Governor to oversee good governance, development, protection of customs.
      -   Schedule says minor minerals and minor forest produce can only be exploited by tribals - but this was still misused by non tribals — no benefit sharing.
      -   Schedule gives power to regulate money lending — Still exploitation faced from money lenders and zamindars.
    -   **PESA 1996**: Could not prevent land alienation despite specific provisions; issues in identification of beneficiaries, permission from gram sabha.
    -   **FRA 2006**: Good start but over the years the provisions have been diluted; Unapproved claim rights are pending with state forest departments.
  -   **Difference in definition of development**:
    -   Development for them means nothing if it makes them alienated from their culture, tradition.
    -   Planning Commission 2008 - modernisation cause of alienation resulting in - “development induced displacement”.
    -   Mining projects, irrigation projects - land alienation - don't want jobs but land.
    -   Creation of SEZ - land acquisition.
  -   **Governance & Excessive Force Issues**:
    -   Vacuum filled by Naxals using Kangaroo courts (but these institutions are highly corrupt and minimal respect to tribal culture).
    -   Corruption in basic welfare - PDS, MGNREGA.
    -   Development Gaps used by Naxals: Ex: development of own schools, hospitals.
    -   Vicious cycle of violence (between both states and LWE), Police force, rapes.
    -   Golden nexus between LWE, lower bureaucracy, political class.
  -   **External, Internal support**:
    -   Nepal, China funding by Maoist organizations.
    -   Collaboration with other anti state forces - Ex: ULFA training maoists, J&K radicals, NE insurgents.
- **Measures Taken**:
  -   National policy and Action plan for LWE - multi-pronged approach - development + security + rights.
  -   **Developmental front**:
    -   NITI Aayog aspirational districts program - most backward gets funds for public infrastructure, rural roads, school, drinking water etc.
    -   USOF - Mobile towers; Road building.
    -   Providing income tax benefits for setting industrial units in backward areas.
    -   Civil Action Program (CAP) - funds to CAPF’s - for welfare activities (festival foods, community infrastructure etc. by them - bridge gap between them, win hearts).
    -   Skill Development: ROSHNI under DAY-Grameen - skill development for rural youth, ITI centres, _Choo lo Aasman Scheme_ by Chhattisgarh.
    -   Educational: POTA cabin schools, schemes _Padhe Dantewada, Likhe Dantewada_.
    -   PESA - governance power to tribals.
    -   Forest Rights Act 2006 - Gram sabha for land acquisition, individual and community rights.
    -   Surrender schemes - Withdrawal of court cases, rehabilitation - monthly stipend of 4k for 36 months etc.
  -   **Law & Order Front**:
    -   Police, public order state subjects but MHA complements through:
      -   Security related expenditure scheme - training, operational needs of security forces (reimbursement of expenditure by CG to SG).
      -   Special Infrastructure scheme - for weapons, infrastructure of forces.
      -   Scheme of fortified police stations.
      -   Bastariya Battalion.
      -   Media - countering propaganda machinery.
      -   Elite Naxal forces such as Grey Hounds of AP, Black Panther of Chhattisgarh.
      -   **SAMADHAN DOCTRINE 2017** (core standards to be applied while dealing with conflicts).
- **Critique of State approach to Naxalism**:
  -   Excessive use of force → Counterproductive → impacts innocent citizens more (Make diagram).
  -   Lack of coordination between states (Naxals due to AP greyhound operation ran to other states - new areas affected).
  -   Blame game, political statements between Centre and States → Loss of credibility of government.
- **Way Forward**:
  -   **Developmental front**:
    -   **2nd ARC 7th Report**:
      -   Sincerity in implementation of Schedule V, PESA, FRA Ex: Oversight Committee to implement FRA.
      -   Avoid non tribal personnel in tribal areas (by using regional cadres).
      -   Mobilizing NGO (acts as link between government and LWE).
      -   Strengthening cooperatives using TRIFED support.
    -   Posting of highly motivated officers rather than punishment postings (incentivise and reward).
    -   Providing flexibility in schemes to allow development based on local needs.
    -   Rehabilitation of displaced communities; Use Brazil/Japan Equity model to provide co-ownership.
    -   Odisha government plans developments projects such as integrated farming of turmeric for Swabiman Anchal (Naxal affected area near Malkangiri District) _Use it as an example/best practice_.
  -   **Law & Order Front**:
    -   State police forces must locally recruit and train.
    -   Sensitization of CAPF.
    -   TOI report - “Diseases not maoist kill most CRPF in red zone”.
    -   IPS heading CRPF cadres - lack of motivation.
    -   Choke funding.
  -   **Others**:
    -   Perception management to break propaganda machinery.
    -   Technology - NTRO - UAV, technology for mine detection, geo tagging of CRPF personnel.
  -   **Good initiative**: IAS **SAURABH KUMAR** lunch (with tribal youth) with collector initiative in Naxal hit Chhattisgarh.

### INSURGENCY IN NORTH EAST

- Northeast India has an extraordinarily important international strategic dimension and is a vital part of the nation’s defence architecture.
- Disparity in development within the region - heterogeneity among the NE states, high level of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, religious diversity (ethnic hotspot).
- Conflicts - National (want separate homeland - Nagalim), Ethnic (Assam-Bangladesh issue), Subregional (many tribals - many demands of state - Gorkha-Bodo).
- **Current Status**:
  -   **Work in Progress**:
    -   **Nagaland**:
      -   Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) has 2 factions NSCN (I-M) and NSCN (K).
      -   Approach: Naga Peace Accord with NSCN (I-M) and Cracking down of NSCN (K).
      -   Demands: Separate constitution, Flag, Greater Nagalim.
    -   **Manipur**:
      -   Ethnic strife between hill tribes and valley areas → 40+ insurgent groups.
    -   **Assam**:
      -   Tripartite Assam Accord with AASU, Government of Assam, GOI.
      -   Cracking down ULFA - _Operation All Clear_ with Bhutan.
      -   2nd ARC Given reasons why youth joining ULFA - Pg 163 of Report (discuss if it needs to be written).
  -   **Success Stories**:
    -   **Mizoram**:
      -   Accord with Mizo National Front in 1986 then statehood.
      -   Relative peace prevails.
    -   **Tripura**:
      -   Demographic Inversion from 70:30 to 30:70.
      -   First state where AFSPA was completely removed in 2015.
    -   **Meghalaya**:
      -   AFSPA withdrawn; Situation under control [Background was fighting with outsiders + within themselves (Garo v/s Khasis, Jaintia)].
    -   **Arunachal Pradesh**:
      -   Facing spill over effects as noted by Standing Committee of RS but largely peaceful.
- **General Causes of Insurgency in NE**:
  -   **Historical**:
    -   Treatment of buffer zone by Britishers (loose administration) → incomplete integration.
    -   Do not share Indian national movement → No common past.
  -   **Geographic**:
    -   Terrain is conducive for insurgency Ex: Guerrilla warfare.
    -   Porous border and misuse of existing provision Ex: Free Movement Regime.
  -   **Economic**:
    -   Highest unemployment rates despite highest rates of literacy in the country.
    -   Difficulty in building infrastructure → No modern industries → No jobs → Discontent among youth.
  -   **Demographic/Social**:
    -   Influx of outsiders/illegal migration → Ex: Tripura/Assam → Identity crisis in hotspot of ethnic diversity.
    -   Tagging them together as ‘North East’ → _homogenizing effect_ → People are averse to such idea due to attachment to identity.
  -   **Political**:
    -   Constitutional provision not implemented in true spirit Ex: Schedule VI, Article 371.
    -   Schedule VI Autonomous Councils ended up creating multiple power centers instead of bringing in a genuine process of democratisation in the region.
    -   Reorganisation of states ignored ethnic and cultural specificities.
  -   **Administrative**:
    -   Weak police machinery; Funds siphoned by cronies.
    -   High handedness of army under the garb of AFSPA.
  -   **International**:
    -   Training camps and ideological support received from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan & China.
  -   **Rise of OC**:
    -   Drugs: Proximity to Golden Triangle is impacting NE region Ex: Moreh in Manipur.
    -   Extortion, parallel governments, Arms trading.
- **Measures taken by the government**:
  -   Creation of ADCs under Schedule VI.
  -   **NORTH EAST VISION 2020**: Plan for infrastructure, economic development, HRD; Union Cabinet approved the **NORTH-EAST INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEME (NEIDS)** to incentivise new industrial units.
  -   **MAKE IN NORTH-EAST**: To promote exclusive North East expertise in areas like tea processing, organic farming, bamboo farming.
  -   Comprehensive surrender cum rehabilitation scheme to bring back youth.
  -   Separate ministry (Ministry of DONER); Creation of NE Council.
  -   Financial support to startup and businesses via _North East Venture Fund_.
  -   International cooperation: Kaladan Project, Connectivity through Bangladesh, IMT Highway, Tourism, Cooperation with Japan.
  -   Development schemes: UDAN Scheme, Skill development schemes such as PMKVY.
- **Way Forward**:
  -   **Political**:
    -   Write basic way forward with respect to law and order of LWE here.
    -   Political solutions to the Assam problem should be discussed - Respect their identity through NRC in Assam.
    -   The Autonomous District Councils (ADC) should be able to function without state hindrance (Ex: conflict between both in Meghalaya as full state in 6th schedule) → act as micro democratic institutions.
    -   Cooperation with neighbours (Operation Sunrise with Myanmar, Operation All Clear with Bhutan for ULFA), Joint training/mock exercise of forces, ensure insurgents don't get weapons from Bangladesh, Myanmar FMR misuse control.
    -   Golden triangle - protect youth from drug culture.
    -   Gradual repealing of laws such as AFSPA to win hearts and minds.
  -   **Economic**:
    -   Pragmatic land use policy should be formulated for attracting industries in the region, encourage MSME’s from NE - Focus on sectors such as organic agriculture, renewable energy, cottage industry, etc.
    -   Local tourism should be promoted with special focus in Incredible India campaign - ‘_Meghalaya half away to heaven campaign_’ - particularly eco-tourism and adventure tourism.
    -   Have adequate road, rail and air connectivity, waterways, internet connectivity and financial inclusion.
    -   Education centres for higher education - IIT, ITI, IIM.
  -   **International**:
    -   Development plan for the North-east should factor in India-ASEAN ties.
    -   To address the issue of inadequate connectivity in the NER, India could consider initiating a regional multi-modal transit agreement between the NER and the four neighbouring countries.
    -   Government should focus on expediting projects, including the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project, the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway.
  -   **Administrative**:
    -   Each state within the NER may be encouraged to draw up their development blueprint in consultation with the NITI Aayog and the North-East Council (NEC).
    -   Different states in the NER have achieved success in different aspects of human development. DONER should document best practices of the region (Sikkim) and disseminate its findings to others.
    -   Water management is a major issue in the NER. Early completion of ongoing irrigation projects in Assam and Manipur under the AIBP, should be accorded high priority.
    -   One of the most pressing issues hampering the progress of hydropower projects in the region is rehabilitation and resettlement (R&R). Attractive R&R packages should be devised for hydropower projects in the region.
    -   Better incentives and rewards for officers working insurgency affected areas.
- **Conclusion**: Most of the armed insurgencies across the world do not end in either total victory or comprehensive defeat, but in a grey zone called ‘compromise’.

### AFSPA

##### 2015: Human rights activists constantly highlight the view that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) is a draconian act leading to cases of human rights abuses by the security forces. What sections of AFSPA are opposed by the activists? Critically evaluate the requirement with reference to the view held by the Apex Court.

- **AFSPA**:
  -   Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958, grants extraordinary powers and immunity to the armed forces to bring back order in the disturbed areas.
  -   AFSPA empowers the Governor of the State to issue an official notification declaring the state or a region within as a “disturbed area", after which the Centre can decide whether to send in armed forces.
  -   Some of these extra-ordinary powers include Fire upon anyone after giving warning, Arrest anyone without warrant, Stop and search any vehicle or vessel and Armed forces personnel have legal immunity for their actions.
- **Arguments for AFSPA**:
  -   Tackle asymmetric warfare.
  -   Demoralising effect on the armed forces if removed.
  -   Army require minimum safeguards from legal harassment.
- **Arguments against AFSPA**:
  -   Abuse of power: fake encounters and sexual assault. Justice **SANTOSH HEGDE COMMITTEE** (on fake encounters) call it “symbol of oppression”.
  -   Terrorism: It has failed to contain terrorism, number of armed groups has gone up after the act was established instead responsible for the spiralling violence in areas it is in force.
  -   Threat to fundamental rights: it weakens democracy. Human rights violations in AFSPA areas are not inquired into - against the principle of natural justice.
  -   Diminishing credibility of democracy: People’s disillusionment with democratic setup is exploited by secessionists - vicious circle.
  -   The decision of the government to declare a particular area disturbed cannot be challenged in a court of law.
  -   The justice **JEEVAN REDDY COMMITTEE** recommended that it should be repealed and the Unlawful Activities Protection Act strengthened to fight militancy.
- **Observations made by SC**: Inquire every death; Relook into section 6 of AFSPA.
  -   The Section 6 of AFSPA which precludes any prosecution, suit or legal proceeding against personnel of the security forces is no longer valid if the deaths of civilians are unjustified.
  -   Every death caused by the armed forces in a disturbed area, be it of a common person or a criminal, should be thoroughly enquired into.
  -   AFSPA should be only used to supplement the civil authority and not supplant the same by putting in place military administration.
- **Recommendations of the REDDY COMMITTEE**: Review after 6 months + parliamentary approval; Grievance cells.
  -   The Union government may also deploy the armed forces without a request from the state. However, the situation should be reviewed after six months and Parliament’s approval should be sought for extending the deployment.
  -   The Union government should set up an independent grievances cell in each district where the Act is in force.
- **Way ahead**:
  -   Amending the AFSPA act to delist offences like sexual offence etc. from it and trying them out using having a robust judicial mechanism.
  -   Proactive role by local government towards real development, especially in social sectors.
  -   Slowly phasing out AFSPA based on threat perception as rooting out AFSPA totally might create chaos.

### LINKAGE OF ORGANISED CRIME WITH TERRORISM

- **Meaning and characteristics**: Pursuance of criminal activity as a business; Features: Specialization, Strict membership, Continuity beyond lifetime of members, Hierarchy.
  -   **Examples**:
    -   Trafficking in cultural property.
    -   Identity related crime - selling DNA, data - Jamtara.
    -   Environmental - poaching (Pangolins), illegal trade, illegal logging Ex: Illegal Rosewood felling in Kerala, biopiracy.
    -   Organ trafficking, Cyber crime, piracy.
    -   Narco drugs (Golden Triangle/Crescent), Human trafficking, counterfeiting currency, gun running.
    -   Spot fixing in sports Ex: IPL.
    -   **Sale of counterfeit health products (medicine/injections) during pandemic** (to counter this INTERPOL conducted Operation Pangea XIV, in which CBI was also involved).
- **Components**: (Write by making diagram)
  -   Criminal groups, Protectors (Businessman, politicians, bureaucrats).
  -   Specialist support (OGW, shooters etc.).
- **Differences and similarities between the two**:
  -   **Similarities**: Both run in enterprise format; Both use violent means; Both seen as criminal in eyes of law.
  -   **Differences**: Covered in table.

| Basis           | OC             | Terrorism             |
| :-------------- | :------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Aim**         | Monetary gains | Political/Sovereign demands |
| **Means**       | Less violent   | Extreme violence      |
| **Media attention** | Remain hidden  | Want constant attention |
| **Relationship with state** | Indifferent    | Wants to overthrow state |

- **Linkages between them** (acts as force multiplier):
  -   **Background**:
    -   UNSC in resolution 1373 (year 2001) noted close connection between international terrorism and transnational organized crime.
    -   Example - Madrid bombing in Spain - drug trafficking mafia became radicalised and carried out bombings (Narco-terrorism).
    -   On a scale where degree of linkage increases from left to right:
      -   Coexistence → Cooperation → Confluence.
  -   **Coexistence**: No relationship; No interaction between them but both benefit from weak state structure, society depended on non state supplier, tolerance for illicit activity.
    -   Not cooperate (and thus only coexist) in many cases to reduce risk of increased attention from law enforcement agencies.
  -   **Cooperation**: Coordination on the basis of quid-pro-quo (customer-service provider relationship) - both require false documents, IT specialists.
    -   **Examples**: OCs providing arms to Terrorist Groups and in turn getting help in form of cross border movement, Terrorist Groups benefiting from OGWs control on territory.
    -   **Indian Examples**: Mumbai Blasts (LeT and D-Company); Insurgent groups providing patronage to OCs.
    -   ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 8.jpeg>)
  -   **Confluence**: One performing the function of the other.
    -   **Examples**: ISIS controlling oil wells; Taliban in poppy farming; Insurgent Groups of Nagaland involved in extortion, Madrid narco terrorism; Naxal Groups involved in drug trafficking, **DAWOOD IBRAHIM** gang both Terrorist Groups and narcotics trafficker.
    -   OCs using terror to protect business interests, Terrorist Groups getting funding for political motives.
    -   However chances of change in aims - Terrorist Groups neglecting political goal for money.
- **Reasons for linkage**: Improving communication, globalization; Terror financing issues after 9/11; Both can thrive better in lawlessness.
- **Measures taken**:
  -   India ratified **UN CONVENTION AGAINST TRANS ORG CRIME (UNTOC) 2000** - international cooperation, mutual legal assistance.
  -   Bilateral cooperation with like minded Countries.
  -   **CCTNS** - coordination of police and other organizations for investigation.
  -   Institutional setup: NIA, ED, NCB, CBI.
- **Challenges faced to combat OCs**:
  -   No central level legislation (legislation are there at state levels Ex: MH Control of OC Act 1995); Also no comprehensive coverage in IPC.
  -   Glorification of OCs by media, cinema Ex: Mirzapur web series.
  -   Difference in laws, definitions, evidence rules across the globe → OCs take advantage of this - also difference in INTERPOL coordination.
  -   Neglect of forensic science graduates and infrastructure such as labs.
  -   Ineffective security agencies: Issues with equipment, training, etc.
  -   Slow pace of trials and conviction even after special courts.
  -   Golden nexus between politicians, businesses and bureaucrats.
- **Way Forward/Suggestions**:
  -   Specialized law to deal with OC (or Centre can bring model act).
  -   Right portrayal by media.
  -   Universal adoption of UNTOC.
  -   Dedicated infrastructure - Specialised cells, forensic labs.
  -   Financial system monitoring for suspicious activity.
  -   Cooperate with social media companies, Christchurch call of action.
  -   Research on Terrorism, OC, Training to enforcement agencies.
  -   Cross sectoral training of agencies - NCB-ED-NIA.
  -   Public awareness - stop youth alienation.
  -   Way Forward of Border security.
  -   Tackle corruption among customs, border forces.
- Terrorism has come a long way from using sea route to attack Mumbai in 2008 to attacking air bases through drones in 2020. International cooperation & consensus are required to deal with this challenge and India must take active role in the process.

### BORDER SECURITY - CHALLENGES, MANAGEMENT

- **Basics**: 15000 km of land border; 7500 km of coastal border; Marked by uneven geographical terrain (from deserts to high altitude mountains to swampy marshes & rivers).
  -   **ABV** quote - _You can change friends but not neighbours_ - Need for Border Management.
  -   India’s Internal Security Challenges are closely linked to Border Management Ex: Militancy J&K, LWE, NE insurgency, OCs, Illegal migration, etc.
- **Border Security v/s Border Management**: BS only focuses on territorial security from hostile elements; BM is wider and includes BS along with Political, Economic, Social development of border areas and legitimate trade and cultural ties with bordering nations.
- **Challenges associated with BM in India**:
  -   Man made artificial boundaries not based on natural features like river etc. - therefore porous.
  -   Unsettled and disputed boundaries with neighbours Ex: LAC issue China.
  -   Organised crime - Human Trafficking, Terrorism, Drug Trafficking, Arms trade, FICN (Nepal).
  -   Use of sophisticated technology by perpetrators Ex: **Drone** Attack on Jammu Air Force Station in **2021** (due to their size they escape military radars).
  -   Multiple forces → Challenges of coordination, command and control.
  -   Diversion of forces for domestic Law & Order duties Ex: BSF used in election (no time for rest & training).
  -   Intelligence Issues: Lack of effective intelligence sharing particularly at field level; Poor intelligence collection.
  -   Galwan valley - Forces without arms due to international treaty backfired - 20 martyred.
  -   Smuggling - underground couriers operating.
  -   Illegal migration → Changes in demographic profile → Subversion of democratic process.
  -   IB Report - Funding of NGO by external actors to stall India’s developmental efforts.
  -   Inadequacy of basic infrastructure Ex: ITBP personnel took 21 days to reach last patrolling point at Arunachal-China border on foot.
- **Measure Taken**:
  -   Aim - Need for balancing hostile interests with legitimate trade at borders.
  -   Department of Border Management at MHA - implements Border Area Development Program (BADP) - fencing, floodlighting, roads, development of ICP’s, welfare to locals on border.
  -   ICP’s - entry/exit points having all facilities of visa, commerce, border security, banking - managed by Land Ports Authority of India.
  -   Pilot projects undertaken under CIBMS.
  -   Operation Sadbhavna by Indian Army to win hearts and minds (Ex: sponsored higher education of 110 students of J&K and Ladakh).
- **Solutions**:
  -   **Use of technology**:
    -   Extension of CIBMS Ex: BOLD-QIT by BSF (from pilot projects to larger scale); Also address training, HR issues, ground level infrastructure needed for use of technology.
    -   Mobilisation of space assets to secure borders (dedicated satellite for Ministry of Home).
    -   Ex: Sensors, aerial imagery, drones.
    -   Laser use on vulnerable stretches, GSAT 7, 7A - dedicated military satellites, IRNSS.
    -   Better weapons.
  -   **Developmental measures**:
    -   Involvement of local population (act as eyes and ears); BGF are seen as face of governance.
    -   Border Haats.
    -   Better education, hospitals for local.
  -   **Operational Issues**:
    -   Tackle psychological stress using yoga/meditation, food, bad climate issues of forces.
    -   Maintain pay parity with Army forces doing the same border tasks.
  -   **International cooperation**:
    -   Resolve difficult terrain conflicts - Ex: Siachen avalanche - **K. HANUMANTHAPPA** 2016.
  -   **Recommendation of GOM report on Internal security 2001** still relevant today:
    -   Take up demarcation of borders (land and maritime) with China, Pakistan, Nepal.
    -   Border state representation too for effective implementation of Border Management.
    -   Not deploy Border forces for non-Border works like elections, law and order etc. (ITBP - special force should not be deployed in naxalite areas).
    -   If border placed under army - ensure full autonomy.
- **Challenges from Pakistan**:
  -   Export of terrorism; FICN; Drug trafficking Ex: Udta Punjab (proximity with Golden Crescent).
  -   Frequent shelling and violation of cease fire.
  -   Sir Creek, Siachen issue.
  -   Difficult terrain - desert, mountains, glaciers.
  -   Internationalisation of Kashmir issue; Nexus with China - CPEC, designation of terrorists.
  -   **Specific Initiatives**: NSG training BSF for counter terror, **MADHUKAR GUPTA COMMITTEE** (4 states bordering Pakistan require different security mechanisms due to difference in terrain; Need for laser walls in marshy plains).
- **Challenges from Bangladesh** (longest border):
  -   Cattle trafficking (loss of revenue to GOI).
  -   Heavily populated border - Illegal migration (demographic profile change in Assam, Tripura).
  -   Safe havens for groups such as ULFA and NDFB; Growing radicalisation/fundamentalism (communal violence in Assam).
  -   **Specific Initiatives**: BSF and BGB - both increasing awareness.
- **Challenges from Nepal**:
  -   Source of FICN; Support of Maoist groups (training camps); Conduit of terrorists (used by ISI as per wikileaks); Smuggling; Radicalisation of youth.
  -   Kalapani issue - Lack of proper demarcation.
  -   **Specific Initiatives**: New SSB intelligence wing, development aid to create employment in Nepal.
  -   Smuggling of liquor into dry state of Bihar.
- **Challenges from Myanmar**:
  -   Misuse of ‘Free Movement Regime’ providing safe havens for NE insurgents.
  -   Narco trafficking (proximity with Golden Triangle).
  -   Other OC - Arms trade, extortion.
  -   Refugee crisis - Rohingyas.
  -   Forest terrain - difficult to guard.
  -   **Specific initiatives**: 13 new ICP’s.
- **Challenges from China**:
  -   Confusion between McMohan Line and Johnson Line; Claim over Arunachal Pradesh.
  -   Undemarcated LAC - different interpretations.
  -   Disparity in infrastructure development vis-a-vis China.
  -   Support to Naxalism - ‘Spring Thunder’ (ideological & resource support).
  -   Water sharing issues: 1000 dams project on Brahmaputra river.
  -   Growing linkages with other Indian neighbours.
  -   **Specific initiatives**: Dhola Sadiya - troop move, delegating power to BRO for administration, financial, Army infrastructure project exempt from forest clearance.
- **Challenges from Sri Lanka**:
  -   Attacks on Indian fishermen (nearby Katchatheevu Islands).
  -   Tamil minority issues - extremist groups - Death of **RAJIV GANDHI**.
- **Challenges from Bhutan**:
  -   Chumbi valley dispute, Chicken’s neck (China using pressure tactics to swap territories & come closer to this strategic) area.
  -   ULFA.

### MARITIME AND COASTAL SECURITY

- **Basics/Significance**: 7,500 km boundary; Indo-Pacific as new global pivot; >90% of trade and 2 million sq km of EEZ; Strategic importance of Islands, sea lines of communications, string of pearls.
  -   _History of 21st century will be written on the oceans_.
- **Issues/Vulnerabilities**:
  -   Maritime terrorism/Piracy & Robbery: Attack on ports and ships.
  -   Infiltration of migrants, refugee influx Ex: Sir Creek, from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
  -   Arms, goods, drugs smuggling, Infiltration (26/11).
  -   Need to protect vital industrial and defence installation on borders (Ex: ISRO launching sites).
  -   Attacks on Indian fishermen Ex: Italian marines case; Problem also near Sri Lanka.
  -   **Governance Issues**:
    -   Lack of coordination among 3 tiers as led by different ministries and governments.
    -   Below par state level monitoring.
    -   Discontent among fishing communities: (they can act as eyes and ears).
    -   Poor training, Shortage of manpower, Infrastructure issues (due to land acquisition).
    -   Difficult terrain, seasonal weather patterns.
- **Measures taken**:
  -   Coastal security scheme Phase 1 - 2005 - better patrolling, infrastructure.
  -   **NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR STRENGTHENING MARITIME AND COASTAL SECURITY (NCS MCS)** headed by Cabinet Secretary coordinates all matters related to Maritime and Coastal Security.
  -   CSS Phase 2 after major learning after 26/11 led to formation of NIA, 3 Tier Security Grid, NC3I (National Command Control Communication and Intelligence System), more police stations, mandatory registration, color coding of fishing boats, installation of transponders, navigation system.
    -   3 level security grid: upto 12 NM by state marine police; 12-200 NM by Indian Coastal Guards; >200 NM by Indian Navy.
  -   **SAGAR PRAHARI BAL** - special force for security of vulnerable areas, naval bases.
  -   Fisherman watch groups, intelligence agents.
  -   **SAGAR KAVACH, SEA VIGIL** - Joint CS exercises.
  -   International exercises summits like IONS.
  -   **NATIONAL MARITIME DOMAIN AWARENESS PROJECT (NMDA PROJECT)** - Led to 2 centres by Indian Navy.
    -   **INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS CENTRE (IMAC)** - _Renamed to NMDA Centre_.
      -   Tracking 1 lakh ships in a year; Data is aggregated and disseminated for intelligence purpose.
      -   Main repository of data generated from NC3I (NC3I is a network that links 50+ coast guard and naval stations located at coasts and islands).
    -   **INFORMATION FUSION CENTRE FOR THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION (IFC-IOR)**.
      -   Actively interacting with 20+ countries and 20+ multinational agencies across the globe for white shipping data.
      -   Liaison officers from various countries such as France, UK.
    -   Both uses sources such as radars, white shipping agreements, Automatic Identification Systems.
- **Way Forward**:
  -   Follow guidelines of IMO for maritime security.
  -   The government must promulgate a National Commercial Maritime Security Policy Document, to articulate its strategic vision.
  -   Clear command SOP, better training to coastal police.
  -   Fisherman as intelligence agent 24/7, day night camera for suspicious activity.
  -   Mock surprise exercises.
  -   Legislative framework to specify statutory duties of government departments, port trusts, state police, private terminal operators, other stakeholders.
  -   Better implementation of security exercises to provide for Inter-agency coordination.

### VARIOUS SECURITY AGENCIES & THEIR MANDATE

![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 9.jpeg>)
**Security Infrastructure in India**

### POLICE REFORMS

- **Enforcement of Law & Order**:
  -   Defence Forces.
  -   State Police.
  -   CAPF.
- **Intelligence Agencies**:
  -   IB.
  -   R&AW.
  -   NTRO.
- **Investigation**:
  -   CBI.
  -   NIA.

#### ISSUES RELATED TO FUNCTIONING OF POLICE

-   **Political Criminalisation Nexus**: **SECOND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS COMMISSION** (2007) has noted that the excessive power in the hands of police has been abused in the past by the political executive.
    -   This nexus interferes with professional decision-making by the police (Ex: regarding how to respond to law and order situations or how to conduct investigations).
-   **Structural Issues**:
    -   Colonial and archaic Indian Police Act 1861 (model police act adopted by various states but various provisions not followed properly).
    -   Top & Bottom heavy: Skewed structure with less officers at middle level.
-   **An Overburdened Police Force**: State police forces had 24% vacancies (about 5.5 lakh vacancies) in January 2016. Hence, while the sanctioned police strength was 181 police per lakh persons in 2016, the actual strength was 137 police. (UN - 222 per lakh).
    -   Individual - enormous workload and long working hours, stress issues (IPS suicide).
    -   Diversion to VIP duties.
    -   Structural causes (overburdened, lack of resources), approval by popular culture (Disha rape case) and political pressure have **valorised violence & torture**.
    -   State of Policing in India Report 2019 - **one in two police personnel do not get weekly offs**.
-   **Need to set Police accountability**: Complaints of unwarranted arrests, unlawful searches, torture and custodial rapes.
    -   Need of accountability of the police to the political executive, internal accountability to senior police officers, and independent police oversight authorities.
-   **Lack of Resources**: CAG audits have found shortages in weaponry with state police forces.
    -   Also, the Bureau of Police Research and Development has also noted a 30.5% deficiency in stock of required vehicles with the state forces.
    -   Further, funds dedicated to the modernisation of infrastructure are typically not utilised fully. For example, in 2015-16, only 14% of such funds were used by the states.
    -   Both the points together show lack of political will to revamp police machinery.
-   Adhoc recruitment & removal of police heads - unlike central forces (overall the selection process is opaque negating democratic accountability).
-   Trust deficit, Poor self image; Citizen have negative perception about police - fear more than public service.
-   Fitness not like Western countries - Can't run.
-   HR violation (encounter killing, custodial violence); Rakshak-Bhakshak Syndrome.
    -   CJI **N.V. RAMANA** said police stations pose the “highest threat” to human rights and dignity.
-   Weak criminal justice system.
-   Mindset issues - where police officers themselves feel it is nothing wrong to beat convicts to extract info (2019 survey by Common Cause & Lokniti).
-   There is a paradox: Citizens no doubt demand newer crime control measures which will keep them safe. At the same time they resent productive and smarter police innovations in the field because of perceived danger to individual rights and privacy.
-   No coordinated database for tracking wanted criminals/persons domestically - in its absence criminals from one police jurisdiction melt into population of other.
    -   There is a need for nationwide integrated database similar to Interpol Notices (that help track fugitives internationally); This can be then shared with countries bilaterally & ultimately deter criminals hoodwinking the law.

#### WAY FORWARD

-   **Curbing Criminalisation of Politics**: Need for laws which debars persons with serious criminal cases from entering the assemblies and the Parliament.
-   Focusing on psychological mindset aspect as well - (which is often ignored).
-   Model Police Act suggested formation of State Police Boards/State Security Composition which will have Leader of opposition, independent members, civil society etc. - **the Board** will play a role in shortlisting and selection of candidates for police **chiefs** (rather than adhoc appointment/removal followed currently; Though boards have been formed by states but they are either not balanced in composition or do not meet regularly).
    -   Best Practice of UK: The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act, 2011, introduced **public confirmation hearings** as an additional layer of check for the appointment of the heads of their police forces known as Chief Constables (this ensures transparency).
-   **Revamping Criminal Justice System**: **MALIMATH COMMITTEE** recommendations for devising a national policy paper on the criminal justice system. Some of the key recommendations are as follows:
    -   A complete revamp of the entire criminal procedure system.
    -   Creation of a fund to compensate victims who turn hostile from the pressure of culprits.
-   **Independent Complaints Authority**: Ex: Model Police Act, 2006 requires each state to set up an authority comprising retired High Court Judges, civil society members, retired police officers and public administrators from another state.
-   **Implementing the SCs directive in PRAKASH SINGH case 2006** (SC had to step in as CG and SG due to lack of political will failed to implement recommendations of successive committees).
    -   Two aims - Increase autonomy and Increase accountability.
    -   Police Establishment Board - to manage transfers, posting, promotion, service matters.
    -   State Security Commission - prevent politicisation of police by state government.
    -   PCA - citizen complaints against police.
    -   ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 10.jpeg>)
-   Well trained analysts to analyse intelligence data, special police officers only for intelligence gathering.
-   Special anti-terror squad in metro within police.

**Steps taken**: MoU between NATGRID and NCRB.
(MoU will give grant to give NATGRID access to the **Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS)** database, a platform that links around 14,000 police stations).

#### Q.) CRITICALLY EXAMINE THE ROLE OF DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF MILITANCY/ TERRORISM IN JAMMU & KASHMIR. (15M)

-   See how many parts it can be broken: You wrote positive role of development initiatives, shortfall, conclusion (No way forward, no manifestation, etc.).
-   **Approach**: Introduce the answer by defining militancy. In the body, explain the **manifestation of militancy in J&K (stone pelting, youth radicalisation, targeted killings).** (both in half page) Next, discuss how developmental initiatives can be an antidote to militancy (reduce trust deficit, Win Hearts & Minds, Jobs, Social integration, G20 meeting). In the next part, suggest what factors are making development lacking to tackle militancy (twin threats, hybrid militants, Complex linkage drug smuggling, Sectarian violence, social media for terror funding). Lastly, suggest a comprehensive approach to tackle terrorism in the region (**Operation Maa by K.J.S. DHILLON** to involve family/civil society; Back to Village Program to re-energise grassroot level, Robust intelligence network). Conclude by impressing on how the confluence of developmental initiatives, security measures, and civil society help in eradicating militancy root and branch (7th Report ARC II - need carrot and stick approach) - Great **KALHANA** who wrote in Rajatarangni, “Kashmir can be won by Power of Spirit (love) … but not by power of Sword (force)”.
-   If you grow snakes in your backyard, don't assume they will bite only neighbours (Pakistan, China, Terrorism).

#### GENERAL WAY FORWARDS/SOLUTIONS FOR INTERNAL SECURITY CHALLENGES
