## Regionalism

-   üí≠: **Definition** (R is an ideology which seeks to adv interest of R over that of state; Fuelled by geog concentration of identity markers); **Thinkers** (Yogendra Y: India is not a N-S but S-N; Sailesh Gowda-B are not geo but dev) **Basis for R (PYQ 16)** (Socio-cul=lang/race/religion eg: Dravidistan vs Aryan race; Bihari explusion from MH; Economic= regional developmental imbalance ie mumbai vs marathwada; Rengma Nagas demand for autonomous council in Assam, Geo=natural resources or loyalties to erstwhile princely rules, Historical=by folklores, Pol-Admin accentuates it), **Forms** (Supra-state ie N vs S or global level N vs S, Inter-state gives eg: river/territory dispute MH vs KR; Intra-state: bodoland/bundel/son of soil in MH/HY; Sep nation-Khalistan/Greater Nagalim) **Effects +ve** (read below) **and -ve** (use forms to create points; read below), **WF/Concl** (Ek Bh SB; Balanced development; Sensitize pol, ECI/Media reforms), Read Yellow pts below avoid green headings ‚≠ê PYQs - 1Q pa since last 2016‚≠ê
-   üèÖ: Yogendra Y, Sailesh Gowda, Using many many examples
    -   +ve: Realise salad bowl concept through regionalism, Right of self determination-Gandhiji‚Äôs quote (ocean of Indianism, being gujrati = port); Subnational solidarity success eg: Kerela;
    -   -ve: Ethnocentrism (own cultural lens used to judge others - eg: NE exodus), Identity Politics, (vote bank politics), Hinders international diplomacy (WB teesta dispute), Son of the Soil
    -   As per BR Ambedkar, Indians must identify themselves as Indians first, Indians last and only as Indians.
-   Intro, Quotes, definition ‚úÖ
    -   Region is any homogenous area which is cult/geog distinct from neighbouring areas. Regionalism is an ideology that seeks to advance the interests of a region rather than that of the state. It is fuelled by geographical concentration of identity markers and encouraged by a sense of relative deprivation
    -   -ve sense: Chauvinism based on regional identity; +ve sense: people‚Äôs love for their region, culture, language (person can be proud Bengali and a proud Indian at once)
    -   Yogendra Yadav : ‚ÄúIndia is not a Nation-State, rather it is a state-Nation‚Äù - Use when regionalism is to be favoured (State-nation accepts that political boundaries do not and need not coincide with cultural boundaries and that a political community can be imagined across deep diversities; This is backed by the idea of unity in diversity)
    -   Sailesh Gowda said ‚ÄòThe boundaries between regions of India are not geographical but developmental‚Äô
-   Basis of R (directly asked in 2016) ‚úÖ
    -   Geo: Regionalism happens due to geog concentration and is further fueled by presence of natural resources such as landforms/forests/climate/coastal areas/international border; Still support their loyalities to pre reorganisation princely states
    -   Historical: Supported regionalism with cultural heritage, folklore, myths
    -   Socio-cultural:
        -   Language as the basis for bifurcation of states such as Assam, PJ (the real demand was religion but was presented under the garb of language as div based on relgion would not have been allowed in secular state); (Explusion of Biharis from MH)
        -   Race, Caste & Religion: Eg: Dravidistan is supported on the histortical premise that Aryan conquest removed their non- brahminical polity and hegemony; Colonial legacy of divide and rule
    -   Economic: Resources are limited and developmental policies could not address regional developmental imbalance in terms of growth hence this leads to demand for smaller states eg: Uttrakhand from UP
        -   Rengma Nagas demand for autonomous council in Assam (feeling of relative deprivation in Mikir hills whose earlier name was Rengma Hills)
    -   Politico-admin: Accentuated regionalism does not create R as such
        -   **Son of the soil**- eg Mumbai for Marathi
-   Forms of R (used in generating content)
    -   Supra-state: Eg: North vs South, NE vs mainland india
    -   **Inter-state**: River disputes, Territory disputes (Assam Mizoram dispute; over Belgavi b/w KR and MH), 3 Bordering village issues b/w Odisha and AP (where AP conducted panchayat polls)
    -   **Intra-state** (Demand for sep state): Bundelkhand, Bodoland, Vidharbha, Harit Pradesh, Saurashtra, Gorkhaland, Greater Tipraland
        -   Son of the soil- eg Mumbai for Marathi, **Haryana local emp law** (run contrary to Ek Bhart Shreshta Bharat)
    -   Demand for **separate nation**: Greater Nagalim, Khalistan
    -   Situation specific- During Corona, Delhi govt- healthcare for only delhi people
-   #### Effects
    -   #### Negative
        -   **Threat to national integration** specially when separatist type movt.
        -   Violent means when used can create internal security challenges - eg: Extremism fueled by ULFA, NSCN
        -   Used as vote-bank politics - used more to gain political mileage
        -   May hinder international diplomacy (West Bengal Teesta dispute)
            -   eg: West Bengal- teesta dispute, Tamil concerns- relations with SL, NE region- Myanmar cautious diplomacy wrt army
        -   Son of Soil Policy (happens in areas of higher ‚Äòin‚Äô migration (bringing outsiders), presence of regional parties, failure of state to acconomdate interests of natives & outsiders) 
            -   Means that the state constitutes the exclusive homeland of its main language speakers, who are the sons of the soil or local residents
            -   **Reasons:** Competition for industrial jobs, Rising unemployment, Rehabilitation of landowners + Agri distress, Linguistic reorg of state, Misued by regional parties **Needed for (+ve side):** Managing migration; Ensure that businesses do not adopt bias against local people (see them as lazy)
            -   **Issues:** May not pass legal scrutiny (**Article 16** only parl can prescribe residence), Auto industry which contributed to 25% of the state GDP of Haryana will be adversely impacted, Dangerous for unity of the country (open pandoras box); Revival of License Raj (akin to pvt nationalisation); Litigation-Does Article 16 cover pvt jobs or only state jobs; **Dr. Pradeep Jain Case** - Son of S would be unconst but not expressly rules on it
        -   **How to combat** (same as ways to tackle regionalism): Inclusive G (Balanced regional growth; Income tax benefits are given for **setting industries/edu/skill institutions** in backward areas); Cooperative federalism, Sensitize politicians, Promoting Unity in diversity; Electoral reforms to penalise hate crime; Ek Bharat Shreshta Bharat-MP in Manipur‚Äôs Sangai Mahaotsav
        -   There is no end to R as it may fuel intra-regional feeling of deprivation (this will happen when resources are not distributed within the region properly) - Difficulty in administrations
        -   May further fuel communalism, domino effect
        -   Resource rich states of JH/CG suffering from dutch disease
    -   #### Positive
        -   Realise **salad bowl concept** in letter & spirit (diversity of India)
        -   Right of Self-determination which makes people empowered and happy: Gandhiji said in this vast ocean of Indianism, being Gujarati is a port for me
        -   Eco: Induces Competitive spirit - eg: Investor meets by GJ, WB, etc
        -   P: Greater the level of subnational solidarity, higher will be the state‚Äôs commitment to social welfare. **Kerala‚Äôs success** is the most striking example (in south unlike north, people are atleast united on languages and not divided like caste,etc which happens in north say in BH)
            -   Multi-party democracy/**Regional Political** parties grew
        -   Admin: Admin efficiency in case of Uttrakhand (Sch V status, hilly areas developed);
            -   Better integration of ppl in overall governance (as not always national interest is pitted against regional interest) - Strengthening of democracy
            -   Vulnerable: Socio-economic development of vulnerable sections in case of states of JH/CG and better admin governace wrt **TG (high rank on EoDB Index)**
        -   Security: Keeping the extremism at bay by accomodating sentiments of all eg: Accord with Mizo National Front (insulating one region from the other)
-   How India as ‚Äònation‚Äô did not negate regional sentiments
-   **Way forward** (How to reconcile national integration and regional autonomy)
    -   Measures taken: Schemes such as Ek Bharat Shreshta Bharat, One Nation One Tax, Promotion of balanced growth (income tax benefits are given for setting industries in backward areas), Three Language Formula
    -   Balanced development models i.e promoting areas left behind eg: Financial Inclusion
    -   These issue will not be threat to Unity if handled in democractic manner. Indian constitution provides enough space for regional demands (thus political autonomy can address regional aspirations - eg: autonomous council)
        -   Approaches used by India to not negate regional sentiments - covered in image above
    -   Sensitize Politics: Political consensus on priortising national interests
    -   Solving border issues ammicably like Assam-Arun Pradesh (**Namsai Declaration)** - more states should adopt cooperation
    -   More decentralisation through 5th, 6th schedule- NCST recommended 6th sch for Ladakh
    -   Print and Electoral Media reforms to cover concerns of all india issues - NE issues, issues of Andaman and not just focus on metro cities
    -   Electoral reforms- Empowering ECI for penalising hate speeches wrt other language,regions
-   **Conclusion:** In the past, India as a nation did not negate regional sentiments by which shows its ability to realise the positive sides of regionalism which are competition, cooperation and co-existence.
-   Regionalism in a **negative sense begets** clashes and conflict, **but in a positive sense** it leads to competition, cooperation and co-existence
-   2020: Do you agree that regionalism in India appears to be a consequence of rising cultural assertiveness? Argue.
    -   1. R is due to rising **cultural assertiveness**
        1. Son of the soil
        2. Hatred towards NE led to exodus in Bangalore
        3. Demand for separate states : examples above
        4. Extremism fueled by ULFA, NSCN in Nagaland
        5. Historic: Guided by myths, customs and folklores
        6. Race, Caste & Religion: Eg: Dravidistan
    2. R is also due to other factors:
        1. Other causes: Economic, Geographic
-   2019: Do we have cultural pockets of small India all over the nation? Elaborate with examples.
    -   1. Define cultural pockets- features of indian society given above
    -   #### Examples:
        -   1. Metro cities such as Delhi/Mumbai (ppl from diff culture came & settled) - Multi Storey housing societies
        2. Central univ/colleges (such as JNU,DU,NSD)
        3. Festival (Ganesh 10 days, or Durga Puja)
        4. Migration causing formation of cultural pockets
        5. Corporate offices and MNCs (celebration of major festivals at work)
        6. Indian sports team/IPL
        7. Media - Bollywood, Television
        8. Others: LBSNAA Cantonment areas (defence forces)
        9. Even idea of global india- Auroville, Parliament, Supreme court
    -   1. However India also consisits of regions (areas where cultural pockets are not there) which have predominance of one form of cultural identity over others as can be seen in 5th and 6th schedule areas of NE to preserve tribal, Ladakh, Kashmir, Andaman islands- which is shows unity in diversity for the large india
-   2018: Discuss whether formation of new states in recent times is beneficial or not for the economy of India.
    -   #### Pros:
        -   1. Political stability creates conducive environment for investment in the region
        2. The Economic Survey 2016-17 stated that smaller states in India trade more than the rest. Smaller states offer better and efficient administration which leads to creation of infrastructure strengtheningthe connectivity in the area, expand its access to market and boost trade for the overall economy of the country.
        3. Greater control over legislative and executive bodies in case of newer states can better deliver the promises made by leaders
        4. Cohesion will lead to **development of regional art, literature**, architecture which can boost tourism and boost consumption of these items/services
        5. Recently formed state Telangana has continuously been among the top ranks in the list of ease of doing business in the country ‚Üí Competitive spirit also ignited among other states
        6. Better economic planning keeping in mind the geography of the region eg: Uttrakhand
    -   1. Cons:
        1. Disputes such as water disputes**,** issue over state capital (Hyderabad in case of AP/TG), dispute wrt division of state resources can hinder the economic progress**;** More boundaries, more disputes
        2. Huge capex to build newer admin/jud/pol machinery eg: New city **Amravati** require investment of **1 lakh crore** which could have been used for developmental purpose or tackling regionalism
        3. Linkages of existing businesses operating before estab of new states may get impacted
        4. Smaller states does not mean better development eg: Ghost hamlets in Uttrakhand
        5. Only new states is not a panacea we need good governance too
    -   2. Solution: **Rather** than increasing **states, increasing number of distt** for targetted scheme delivery**; Increase autonomy of local bodies** in the region
-   2017: In the context of the diversity of India, can it be said that the regions form cultural units rather than the States? Give reasons with examples for your view point.
    -   1. Though the government **reorganized various states and also formed new states but cultural units have been intact** in India till this day. Examples such as:
    2. **Inter-state** diversity
        1. **Chhath parv** is celebrated by **eastern** end of **Uttar Pradesh** and **western** end of **Bihar**
        -   1. **Rice fish dietary culture** has also been practiced across all coastal regions
        2. **Hill dominated culture** in states of HP, Uttarakhand, JK
        3. Festivals such as **Holi are celebrated all over india**; **Agricultural festivals such as Bihu/Pongal/Baisakhi** promote ties **based on economic background** rather than religion
        4. **Sports festivals** such as IPL are combining all cultures
        5. Naga distributed over many NE states, **8 states of NE having similar traditions**
        6. **Population living in green revolution area** that comprises Punjab, Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh practices nearly same traditions and **represents a single cultural unit**
        7. **Combined south dravidian culture** at the same time multiple identities even within diff states
        8. **Similarity** in culture of **Hindi belts - MP, UP, RJ**
    -   1. **Intra-state** diversity
        1. **MP- Malwa plateau**- urban cities of Indore, Khargone region dominated by tribals
        -   UP- diff cultures of west, middle, east UP
        -   1. Even within Maharasthra- **Mumbai kind of mini India**, diff demands of Marathwada, Vidarbha
        -   WB- Gorkha culture, Bengali culture
    -   1. However **state a primary cultural unit too on basis of language**- as seen in demands since independence- AP, Gujarat, Maha, Madras etc also **continued demands for new states on basis of language** (Sindhi pradesh, gorka identity, bodo etc); **Rajput culture RJ**
-   2016: What is the basis of regionalism? Is it that unequal distribution of benefits of development on regional basis eventually promotes regionalism? Substantiate your answer.
-   2016: Has Linguistic states strengthened the cause of Indian Unity
    -   1. Covered in post independence
-   2013: Growing feeling of regionalism is an important factor in generation of demand for a separate state. Discuss. (historic and contemporay examples/map)
    -   1. Various dimesions of R- causes with examples (given above)
    2. **However** new state without R (**due to admin efficiency or security needs**)- for admin efficiency (eg Chattisgarh, Uttarakhand) without very vocal R demands, Ladakh, JK based on politic- security needs
-   2005: "Political boundaries and regional boundaries need to be co-terminus.‚Äù Do you agree?
    -   1. This vision of nationhood is more European than Indian. It draws upon a **model of the nation-state** that emerged in Europe. Europe‚Äôs civilisational unease with diversities has had a long history. Nineteenth century nation-states were an attempt to **settle this unease by matching the cultural boundaries of a nation with the political boundaries of a state**. If there was a mismatch, the nation-state model tried either to shift the political boundaries‚Äîby creating new countries or merging existing states‚Äîor to alter the cultural boundaries by means of cultural integration, assimilation, coercion and even ethnic cleansing.
    2. **Should be co-terminus**: preservation of culture, **social cohesion**, better admin in case of **language- easy governance** in context of linguistic states, **less chances of conflict,** easy to handle security, promote culture of area/tourism, Grassroot l‚Äôship in politics
    3. **Should not be: too many states**, chances of **frictions**, diff in admin, **threat to national integration**, too many elections
    -   1. Cover points of above question in context of diff cultural units - cant make all pol boundaries
-   1985: Keeping in view the political developments in India explain how the need for the national integration and the demand for the regional autonomy can be reconciled
    -   1. Refer way fwds above

## Secularism (2024)

-   üí≠: **Definition** (Doctrine that opposes all forms of inter and intra religious domination), **Key terms** [Sarva Dh Sambhav (equal respect to all R), Complete separation vs Principled Distance] **Constitutional** (Article 25-28, Article 14/15/16, 42nd AA, 51A(e)-promote brotherhood; Right to religion is not absolute though), **Challenges/Threats to S** (Indv, Society, Pol, Admin-2.5% Sachar Rerport, PP Secularism rather than Cont Sec, Inter-national, Media), **Good example** (All faith prayer for new parl foundation), **Way Fwds** (Moral Education, Responsible Journalism via PCI Norms, Periodic convention of Nat Integration Council, UCC, PP oversight over spokesperson) **Conclusion** (Soul of R is one, encased in multiple forms-MG; There is no doubt Secularism is relevant to, and appropriate for India and thus must be defended from evils of communalism, casteism, party politics and obscurantaism); Intra-religious denominations examples- Caste discrimination, Prejudice against women, Sectarianism-Shia/Sunni sects) **Contemporary issues** (UCC, Triple Talaq, Sabrimala Case); Read yellow highlights below
-   **Concept:** _Secularization_ is to be understood as a process in which ties of religion, casteist and ethnic particularism are gradually transcended, in which the politics is defined on rationalist and ideological lines, and in which religion, caste and ethnicity are confined to the sphere of ‚Äòprivate‚Äù life 
-   üèÖ: Tolerance/Pluralism are the pillars of Indian secularism; Sachar Committee Report-2.5% in bureaucracy; Data on communal violences **2900** cases b/w 2017-2021; (_5 yrs from 17 pe khatra_), Madan Commission;
-   Intro, Quotes, constitutional articles ‚úÖ
    -   Doctrine that opposes all forms of inter and intra religious domination (NCERT)
    -   In Indian context , Secularism means Equal Respect to all Religion. It is inspired by the spirit of ‚ÄúSarva Dharma Sambhava‚Äù (Gandhi)
        -   Gandhiji **viewed religion** through **prism of liberal** thoughts ‚Üí therefore ban untouchability
        -   Viewed **secular state** where no single religion can dominate others
        -   **Religion** is a private affair and **no space in politics**
    -   Rajeev Bhargava says that Indian secularism did not erect a strict wall of separation, but proposed a 'principled distance' between religion and state (or principled state intervention)
    -   **Constitution: Article 25-28, 14,15,16 (prohibit discrim on religion), 30 (allows rel minorities to set edu inst)** (can be used in Intro); 42nd AA, Schedule VII (Concurrent list);
-   Indian vs West Secularism (covered in GS2)
    -   In Western context , it means complete separation of state and religion. The wall between them is strict, thus there is no scope for state sponsored religious reforms
    -   In the west, religion as a private matter; No support to institutions run by minorities
    -   Whereas in case of India the **wall is porous** thus allowing state to intervene and provide progressive voices eg: **banning sati, untouchability,** triple talaq, etc; while providing **equal protection to ‚Äòall‚Äô religions (room for reforms)**
        -   **Principle of harmony** rather than strict separation; **Religious tolerance**; **Humanity** at its core;
    -   More liberal: Indian secularism is more liberal in a sense it is not neutral rather accept every religion in a broader sense
-   #### Challenges/Threats faced by Secularism
    -   Indv level: Religious fundamentalism (amplified by social media)
    -   Societal level: **Forced conversions (against Stanislaus judement),** Rise in **majoritarianism eg: Imposition of vegetarianism** (imposing the morals of majority community over the minorities), **Casteism** (greatest roadblock to the furtherance of secularism in our polity), **Obscurantism** is a great hurdle eg: Mob lynching/ **Valentine Day attacks** (people give importance to customs/traditions rather than reason); **Communalism** (data of NCRB 2900 cases b/w 2017-21) 
    -   **Economics Causes** of Communalism: Unemployment leads to riots; Competition of resources (2008 Indore riots marginalisation of Muslim blacksmiths in tin based industries by Hindus); Ghettoization as observed in Ahmedabad 
    -   **Madan Commission** (1970) said primary builders of communal tensions are politicians
    -   International influence: attacks on minorities in BG, Afghanistan issue
    -   Corporatisation of Media ‚Üí **Sensationalisation** of news or circulation of fake news
    -   Political level: Communal politics, Exclusion of minorites (**Sachar Committee Report** - Muslims **only 2.5% in bureaucracy**)
        -   **‚ÄòParty-political secularism‚Äô rather than constitutional secularism -** political parties keep off religion or **intervene as and when it best suits** their party or electoral interests (_parties are not very secular in terms of composition and working_)
-   Issues with Secularism ‚úÖ
    -   Pratap Bhanu Mehta- I sec policy leaves all communities insecure due to divisive politics (asked once in PYQ)
    -   Hindu Majoritarian inferiority complex wrt pseudo-secularism (eg Rajiv gandhi- Shah Bano judgement)
    -   Threat to cultural practices in question
        -   Crackers during Diwali, Triple Talaq, Sabrimala, Freedom of speech used to demean gods, OTT- eg PK movie- Shiv ji in Bathroom, Tandav webseries, pseudo sec, Diff laws for minority inst (given autonomy) and others- eg: dont wear bangles, mehendi in school
            -   However write positives of sec in end- that it reforms orthodox practices- Nikah halala, protects minority, politics of dec etc
-   Contemporary issues with Secularism: ‚úÖ

    -   2022: 19. Are tolerance, assimilation and pluralism the key elements in the making of an Indian form of secularism? Justify your answer. (Answer in 250 words) 15
        -   **Intro**: Indian form of secularism: Rooted in unique historical circumstances, unlike west‚Äôs complete isolation here exists principled distance with equal respect and protection to all religion
        -   India has always been land of tolerance, assimilation, pluralism and has shaped secularism in following ways:
            -   **Tolerance**: Ancient (Samudragupta allowed Meghavarman to estab monastery); Late Ancient (Harshavardhan adopted buddhism w/o giving up hinduism); Medieval (Akbar- Sul-hi-kul policy, Ibadat Khana, KDR employed muslim in admin); MIH (Bhakti-Sufi, Secular politics of MG Ranade, GK Gokhale), Post indep (no official state religion, Article 25-28, etc), Values of **Vasudev Kutumbakam **
            -   **Assimilation**: Process by which diff groups are absorbed into dominant culture of country
                -   eg: Sufi‚Äôs influence from Bhakti used yogic postures, breathing technique; Dr BR Ambedkar called for assimilation of downtrodden into mainstream, Sufi saints are revered by all faiths
            -   **Pluralism**: variety seen in smaller groups making them unique
                -   Festivals (Durga festival in WB, Ganesh festival in MH, X‚Äômas celebrated by all); Linguistic and cultural rights (29,30); Art and architecture (Ajanta having structures of multiple religions), Mughal art had native indian features
        -   **Concl**: We need to ensure value edu so that younger lot can understand and appreciate not only its own religon but also that of others OR these 3 virtues are the 3 pillars of Indian secularism
    -   2017: The spirit of tolerance and love is not only an interesting feature of Indian society from very early times, but it is also playing an important part at the present. Elaborate.
        -   Explain tolerance and love in PESTEL context
        -   Early times- **Indus valley- secular, policies of Ashoka- dhamma**, Mughal rulers like Akbar- Sul-hi-kul policy, Ibadat Khana (discussions), **Buddhism** effect on **Ashoka**, diff invaders assimilated in india due to love and tolerance here, Jainism, **Bhakti Sufi** movt effect- Kabir, Ahimsa, H-M unity advocated by Gandhiji during NCM, Nehru secular approach
        -   **Present times: Non aligned movt, No first use in nuclear doctrine**, federalism, **wildlife care, environmental pacts** with global nations, need to fight common enemies such as poverty, pollution, crime and terrorism, relevant for **soft power diplomacy**
        -   However colonial rule- divide and rule policies- sowed the seeds of communalism- seen in Partition, etc **(prescriptive tone, still lot to be done)**
            -   **Current issues of intolerance**- mob lynching, caste and communal riots, biased social media in post-truth world, divisive politics, hate speech

-   #### Factors/Causes aiding Communalism
    -   Political: Used as a tool by political parties to fulfill their vested interests (politics of appeasement) - Lack of oversight over spokespersons
    -   Communal politicians have successfully used the economics of inequality, uneven development and under-development to reinforce their stranglehold over the society.
    -   **Madan Commission** (1970) said primary builders of communal tensions are politicians
    -   Economic factors:
        -   Feeling of **relative deprivation** due to uneven growth, unemployment ‚Äî both of them aggravates insecurity in the minds of common men
        -   PYQ: Communalism arises either due to power struggle (religious distinctions were coinciding with class distinctions) or relative deprivation
        -   Sachar Committee conveyed about deprivation of Muslims in emp/literacy/admin/political representation
            -   Exclusion of minorites (Sachar Committee Report - Muslims only 2.5% in bureaucracy)
    -   Social factors:
        -   Religious fundamentalism (which is militancy by self styled believers who try to arrest erosion of their religious identities), Forced conversion, Rise of majoritarianism (beef consumption; SC held that nobody likes to be told what to eat or how to dress)
        -   **Psychological factors** such as lack of inter-personal trust and mutual understanding (**feelings of US vs THEM) or C creates** **in-group solidarity by creating negative stereotypes about the out-group**
        -   **Lack of inter-personal trust:** As per Pew Research Centre‚Äôs Survey 2021 (Religion in India: Tolerance and Segregation) **-** Majority of Indians prefer friendships to be largely restricted to their own religious and/or caste groups
    -   International factors: Covered in Secularism
    -   Media: Sensationalisation of news by media, spread of false rumours using social media (ghettoisation of the community); Circulation of fake news and rumours
    -   Administrative Failure: A weak law and order is one of the causes of communal violence; Lack of trust towards administration by minorites; Police seen as being biased
    -   Historical: Fueled by anger from pre-indep era, partition, over-emphasising ancient culture while undermining medieval/british periods
-   Is Communalism a threat to national integration? ‚úÖ
    -   Not a threat: when its nature is that of - Welfarist (examples estab of hostels, scholarship, etc are given to promote community), Retreatist (when memb are prescribed to abstain from politics eg: Bahai community refrains from politics)
    -   Yes a threat: When it assumes form of - Retaliatory C (harms or injures other community), Separatist C (autonomy is asked but within Indian union), Secessionist C (wants to leave Indian union), Religious Fundamentalism
-   Current issues ‚úÖ
    -   Misuse of Anti-religious conversion laws (UP, MP) which bar inter-religious marriages may deepen communal divides and hamper right to privacy & marital freedom
    -   COVID and communalism- Tablighi Jamaat case
    -   Radicalization among youth where Indian joining ISIS

    -   Beef consumption (violate Article 21)
    -   Attack on Christians in Odisha, communal riots, mob lynchings, Social media issues, Fake news, Politics on R rather than dev
-   +ve examples of harmony: ‚úÖ
    -   Same as secularism
    -   Masjids in Sri Nagar called for showing solidarity with terror attack victims which belonged to Hindu & Sikh minority in J&K (during 2021)
    -   Sikh community sanitised Jama Masjid in delhi ahead of Eid 2020 ‚≠ê (This was mentioned earlier under Secularism, good to keep consistent if it's a repeated example.)
-   Way forward (keep issues in mind while suggesting solutions) ‚úÖ
    -   Schemes such as Ek Bharat Shreshta Bharat (promoting unity in diversity through state level exchanges, book translation regional lang, movies, sports eg: MP in Manipur‚Äôs Sangai Mahaotsav), One Nation One Tax
    -   The National Integration Council, the apex body mandated to fight communalism, casteism, regionalism and parochialism, must meet regularly (has not met ever since the BJP-led government came to power at the Centre)
    -   Gandhi - The need for the moment is not one religion for the whole human kind, but mutual respect, equal regard and tolerance of the devotees of different religion. As the soul of religion is one encased in multitude of forms
    -   NCRWC 2000 recommended setting up of ‚ÄòInter-Faith Commission‚Äô to promote inter-religious harmony and social solidarity
    -   Sachar Committee report on the status of Indian Muslims recommended the creation of an Equal Opportunities Commission to deal with complaints of intolerance and exclusion
    -   Movies like - Anek, Bajrangi Bhaijan, Chak De India, Article 15
-   2018: ‚ÄòCommunalism arises either due to power struggle or relative deprivation.‚Äô Argue by giving suitable illustrations. [Causes (Power struggle and relative deprivation)]
    -   1. **Power Struggle:** The **irony in Indian** context was such that **religious distinctions were coinciding with class distinctions** Eg: Hindu landlors vs Muslim peasants in Eastern Bengal whereas Muslim zamindars vs Hindu money lenders in Western Punjab
        1. Political competition on ethnic lines rather than development; Power struggle used as by politicians to gain mileage; Other Points (Legacy of british - communal electorate; Minority in fear; Riots doctored to harden beliefs)
        2. Also one point can be based on Constant view of power
    2. **Relative Deprivation**: Due to differences in level of development there has been resentment in eyes of people. The **govt. is usually in tightspot while dealing** with such matters due to:
        1. Majority regards any action of govt towards minority as minority appeasement
        2. Deprivation wrt police protection, HR abuse leads to indoctrination of minorities
        3. Whereas measures taken for majority is seen as marginalisation by the minority community
        4. Deprivation to majority wrt **beneficial schemes** (Haj Subsidy- now ended) **for minority may lead to communal angle**
    3. End with how tackle- ideals of secularism- welfare of all
-   2017: Distinguish between religiousness/religiosity and communalism giving one example of how the former has got transformed into the latter in independent India. [Religiousness vs Communalism]
    -   1. Religiosity - quality of being religious, **pious and devout**. In other words it is known as having strong religious feeling or belief
    2. Communalism is a **negative connotation** which indicates political trade in religion
    -   #### Differences between the 2:
        -   1. R is **older** concept and as old as civilisation; where as C is **newer** concept **introduced by British Viceroy Minto**
        2. Concerned with **worship of god** whereas C is concerned with **using religious symbols for mobilisation** of followers of one religion in political space
        3. Religiosity by default is **not associated with violence** where as in C the religious identity **overrides everything else**
        4. Religiosity is **inclusive and tolerant** whereas C generally found to be **exclusivist and intolerant**
    -   1. How religiousity got transfomed? **Due to unbalanced economic development** and other causes listed below
    2. Example of Bhindaranwale & the communalization of Sikhs (use this point to highlight differences)
        1. After independence, the Sikhs were **no longer receiving preferential treatment** in the recruitment of Indian army, unlike during the British raj. Landless sikhs **could not reap advantage of Green Revolution** unlike land-owning Hindu-Jat families
        2. Radical Sikh leaders like **Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale used this frustration of Sikh peasants and unemployed youth**
        3. The **5Ks and** paying obeisance to the holy book of **Guru Granth** are the components of the **Sikh religiosity**
        -   1. But, **Bhindranwale** even **threatened to kill the school principals who did not enforce the aforementioned symbols of Sikh religiosity** upon the students. Thus, he transformed religiosity into communalism for his petty agenda.

    -   Use  only for below
-   Basics: ‚úÖ
    -   Globalisation is process where people & countries are getting integrated culturally and economically through trade, labour movt, media, travel and cultural exchanges. Involved movement of people, capital, goods & services
    -   Local events global consequences and global events local consequences (Farm Bill response from Rihana, Impact of MeToo in Hollywood to Bollywood) eg: Global food/fuel inflation fuelled by local Russia-Uk conflict

    -   Other factors: Global challenges (env, dis mgmt, health), Strategic interest are getting linked, Culture (Buddhism linking India with SE Asia & beyond)
-   #### Different forms of impact on Indian Culture:
    -   #### Homogenisation: aka cultural uniformity or westernisation
        -   **Homogenisation of Language**: The **usage of English language - 24 cr Eng speaker**- 2nd most in any country

            -   Internet enables the homogenizing force of English as the world's common language- enables the speakers of various small languages to get connected and build common content [like various regional Wikipedia]
            -   The same globalization allows for cuisines of various nations to be explored by people across the world like Thai, Chinese, Indian or Mexican
            -   Again, a connected world also allows one to **explore different religions and spiritual paths**. You could be sitting in Jakarta and exploring Taoism, Shintoism, Hinduism or various African/native American religions.
            -   Youtube effect- learning various distant arts, new music like Blues - getting connected to history of other countries
    -   **Hybridisation: aka Glocalisation** (Global + Local) 
        -   Eg: Mcdonalds not setlling beef products, Remix music culture, Dubbing of Hollywood in local lang, Celebration of new days such as Father‚Äôs/Mothers day, Contractual marriages (which are done with an aim for getting visa and generally last till the expiry of visa)

    -   **Religious violence is getting connected** across border - France ka badla NZ mein, etc
    -   Computers are being used to prepare horoscope and impress upon the knaive that computer made horoscopes are free from errors. Thus the tools of modern IT have come handy to pseudo science in its effect to propagate and reinforce old age superstitions
    -   Our traditional religions and cultures were gradually subverted - **new forms of god emerging in form of various babas who exploit gullible**
    -   Newer generations are getting away from naming their kids after names of gods**;** They are opting for much more **spiritual route** rather than dogmatic rituals

    -   **Spread** of exotic species due to increasing world trade; **Invasive Alien Species - African Cat fish**
    -   Rapid Urbanisation ‚Üí Urban heat islands, land fills
    -   Commercialisation and mono-culture in agriculture - eg: Indonesian rainforests being replaced by oil palm plantations
    -   Increase fuel consumption which led to rise in pollution
    -   Dumping of industrial waste in oceans and in soil. Oil spills from oil tankers threat pose threat to marine environment
    -   Land use change, degradation, **Scramble for Africa 2.0**
    -   +ves: Global summits, organisation such as ISA, research, awareness, Global movements - Fridays for Future, Collaboration to reduce wildlife trade - **Operation WILDNET (by CITES)**
-   #### Impact on Youth:
    -   **Youth: +ve** (Cosmopolitanism, Employment ‚¨Ü, Cultural hybridisation, Foreign Edu); **-ve** (Consumerist attitude, Youth spend less time with the older generation resulting in loss of wisdom handed down; cases of depression and suicide, more deviant behaviour w/o family oversight)
-   Conclusion:
    -   Gandhiji said ‚Äò**let the wind from all the side** roam around my **house freely** but I **should remain firmly rooted in my own identity** as well‚Äô
    -   Social and Legal institutions need to cope with changes in (based on Qs) to safeguard Indv liberty and social good

        -   1. Covered above
    -   2018- G generally said to promote cultural homogenisation but due to this cultural specificity appear to be strengthened in the Indian society. Elucidate.
        -   1. Start with global homogenisation
        2. **Cultural specificity** - A large segment of populace feels insecure by the inroads of globalization and are trying to preserve their cultural traditions and practices (**can write points of glocalisation)**
            1. Attempts of govt to **revive local languages- NEP mother toungue**
            2. Yoga- Not only promotion in global domain, Indian youth too focussing on traditional health activities
            3. Nutrition- **revival of millets** used since earlier times **due to needs of climate change & health**
            4. Cultural Nationalism leading to conflicts; Rise of right wing nationalist parties in the west; Caste- onslaughts of social media- caste stories, past injustice circulated to harden caste consciousness, supression of Valentine celebration; Religion- Fear of secularism and democracy among traditionalist- use of mass media for pointing our religious deprivation
    -   2016- To what extent G has influenced core cultural diversity in india?
        -   1. Write both negative and positive effects of G on cultural diversity
    -   #### Impact on women (2015)
        -   1. Positive impact on women
            1. Globalisation has created **more jobs (achieve social mobility)**- rise of not only working men but also women, higher pay leading to quality btw sexes in corporate domains, developed **entrepreneurship capabilities** among W; Increase in their **labour force participation**

            -   Benefits of gig economy can be reaped;
            -   1. **Kutchcraft**, an association of 110 craftswomen ºs groups has generated over 6,000 job opportunities since India embarked on the path of globalisation; **Women role in service sector is much more accepted by society;**
        -   1. Negative impact on women
            1. SEZs and EPZs are breeding grounds for women exploitation limited labour laws apply- prefer to hire women because they are more docile

            1. but issues of digital divide
        2. Youtube- can explain almost any education with great clarity
        3. Indian univ need to compete to attract students going abroad, Better research with foreign uni
        4. Recent NEP- open up foreign uni campus india as well as attracting students to study in India
        5. Flip side - erode our traditional values and ethos- students finding western values cool- breaking friendships, marriages, **rising materialism**, neglect of Indian system of medicine, decline of Hindi language, dilution wrt aim of **education which now focuses on getting degrees**, **glorification of western edu model**
    -   2008- G Brought class divides rather than class less society
        -   1. Covered above in general points
        2. Other issues in achieving inclusive growth- rising materialism, inequality etc
        3. **Counter -** Opportunities to skill and learn are more or less getting available to all

## Urbanisation, their problems and their remedies (question in 2023)

-    only yellow pointers below (only of 1st next point/para only, rest no need), asked in 2023
-   üí≠: Intro fact (From 31% to 41% by **2030; 70% GDP**), **Social effects** (disruption of old bonds; Caste‚Üí Class; Annonymity, Mini cultural pot, Suresh Tendulkar Committee ~**13%** popu of urban ppl poor, _normal apni Tendulkar Cmt, 13.7 vs 25.7% tha na_ ), **7 key Problems** (Pol-Gov&Fin, Eco-Infra, Social, Env-Delhi 2% Yamuna patch bt 70% pollution, Housing/Slum, Health-lifestyle/mental h, -ve fallouts on rural areas), **Govt measures** (Smart City, AMRUT, PMSVANIDHI, Jal Jeevan-Urban; Urban Forests), **Way Fwd** (**2nd ARC 6th Report**-Sep cadre, National Urban Policy Framework (_NUPF_) **2018**-Incl cities for LIG, Use of ICT, Cascaded Planning, Transport oriented dev, **NITI**-Model Tenancy Act, Municipal B, Monetise land, Waste to Energy Corporation of India; **15th FC**-publish audit/circle rate; Counter-magnet cities), **Best practices** (Kerela Urban Employement, **Indore Model** of waste management, China‚Äôs factory dorms; **Mahila Milan** developing Pune Slums), **Conclusion** (SDG-11)'; **Terms** (Cities are a technology for poverty reduction; Cities act as magnets; sub-urbanisation, RURBAN, Urban Sprawl (low density housing), Urbanisation of pandemic - 10 cities account for half COVID Cases); Global example (New York's GDP > Russia, Tokyo has short transit timing, High popu density of Tokyo); New York and Copenhagen models of Urbanisation (Vertical density, green spaces, bicycle infra, Community Involvement)
-   #### Conclusion/Way Fwd:
    -   WB President Ajay Banga said ‚ÄúMunicipal financing is the way for India's progress''
    -   A sound urbanisation policy is the need of the hour and cannot be delayed. The policy needs to cater to issues of finance, size of cities, lessons from the historical organizations, city planning should go beyond its political boundaries for viable agglomeration, cater to issues of climate change, utilize technology to alter the working patterns like work from home to reduce burden on transport infrastructure
    -   Solutions: Transforming Urban Governance, Ensuring Participation from Private Sector, Engaging with the People, Ease of Living is and will remain as important as Ease of Doing Business, Development of green buildings along with GRIHA guidelines, Fiscal empowerment of urban local bodies
    -   Urbanization yields several positive effects if it happens within the appropriate limits. Some of the positive implications of urbanization, therefore, include the creation of employment opportunities, technological and infrastructural advancements, improved transportation and communication, quality educational and medical facilities, and improved standards of living
    -   Committee on urban infrastructure headed by Isher Judge Ahluwalia had estimated in its 2011 report that Indian cities would collectively need to invest around Rs 40 trillion in the two decades to 2031
    -   ‚ÄòGood‚Äô urbanisation is crucial to delivering economic justice for women, children and other vulnerable sections of the society. It is impossible to have good urbanisation without focussing on the small and medium cities
-   Global Examples: New York City‚Äôs GDP equals that of Russia with 6% of the people and 0.00005% of the land.; Tokyo has a third of Japan‚Äôs population but planning and investments have ensured that essential workers like teachers, nurses, and policemen rarely commute two hours (v/s Bengaluru where taxi and auto speeds average 8 km/hour)
-   Env Issues of urbanisation, solution [[Env issues of urban life- air pollution, urban heat islands, urban floods (see env content)- focus city specific]]; SPM Rurban Mission [[Rural-urban integration, schemes, benefits, issues]], At last [[PYQs on Urbanization]]
-   Introduction (facts of india, world, trends)
    -   Urbanisation refers to the population shift from rural to urban areas, the decrease in the proportion of people living in rural areas, and the ways in which societies adapt to this change
    -   **Census 2011: ~31.16% (India lives in villages),**; Expected to be reach **41% by 2030**
    -   Global Average of urbanisation stands at ~54%
    -   World Bank- Extent of U in india low compared to China (54%), South Korea(82%), Mexico(79%)
    -   Cities are the **centres of economic growth** as they account for **70% of India‚Äôs GDP**. Thus urban areas are more important towards achieve 5 TD economy
    -   As per C. Rangarajan Expert Group: 17% of urban pop in slums, 13% urban households w/o toilets, 30% urban households w/o clean drinking water and 26.4% urban pop is BPL
    -   Types of Urbanisation: Over-urbanisaiton, **Sub-urbansation** (ppl moving to outside fringes when supported by public transport, high cost of living, new work culture, clean env), **Counter-urbanisation** (reverse urbanisation due to push back factors)
-   Causes
    -   Better eco opp, city life fascination, escaping from orthodox villages, better infra
-   Effects
    -   Social effects (compared to rural) - PYQ 2016 - (read bold)
        -   Family and Kinship- **disruption of old bonds**, joint family (**frnds more imp than immediate family**), individualism, more divorces, disregard for old age
        -   Imp impersonality (lack of emotions) in social relations
        -   **+ve:** Women- **more opportunities** in urban setup, comparitively liberal mindset, however issues of dual work, unequal pay in work, urban crimes
        -   Caste- Normalisation of inter-caste marriages, **less caste solidarity compared to rural**
        -   **+ve: High social mobility in urban areas facilitated by anonymity and homogenization**
        -   Class- Major problem among westernised elite (**caste factors are reducing and class factors have increased**)
        -   Ghettoisation of Religion ‚Üí Riots possibility
        -   Rise of New Middle Class
        -   Resource competition breeds regionalism ‚Üí Son of Soil
        -   Old Age - Old age homes ‚¨Ü‚¨Ü
        -   **Urban crimes**: in modern urban centers corruption and **white collar crimes** (financial & technical frauds) are rampant
        -   **Cultural heritage** is being lost & Environmental issues are ‚¨Ü‚¨Ü; High cost of living of urban centres; Consumerism thru advertisement
        -   **+ve: Melting pot of people** with diverse ethnic, lingustic, cultural diversities
-   #### Problems
    -   **Housing & Slums**: Slums are residential areas considered unfit for human habitation because of overcrowding, lack of sanitation, breeding ground of diseases (Dharawi during COVID), social tensions, etc. Slums are no longer a temporary halting points as almost 66% have lived in the same house for 3 generations or more; One in six people in urban areas live in slums **(17% in slums Census 2011)**
        -   LA 2013 compensation too high- affordable housing not so affordable, railway, PSE large unutilised lands in cities- monetise for AH
        -   Stringent land conversion rules - bureaucracy- impacts Af f Housing
        -   **India‚Äôs urbanisation** process has been **largely ‚Äúmessy and hidden‚Äù, according to a World Bank report** which states that the **urban sprawl (unrestricted growth in many urban areas with little concern for urban planning) actually accounts for 55.3 per cent** of the country‚Äôs total population and that official census figures understate it as **only 31 per cent** (messy is due to slums)
        -   **Causes of Slums**: Improper city planning, Pvt. developers not interested in affordable houses, Failure of state govts to implement National Urban housing & habitat policy 2007 which says every year 15% of land will be allocated for social housing
    -   Socio-cultural problems: Cultural homogenization; Spatial pattern of communal violence as urban areas being segregated based on race/caste/ethnicity; Resource competition breeds regionalism
        -   Urban crimes: in modern urban centers corruption and white collar crimes (financial & technical frauds) are rampant
    -   Physical Infrastructure:
        -   **Overcrowding** and pressure: eg: Mumbai‚Äôs pedestrian bridge accident, Acc to **Traffic index by Tomtom-** Mumbai most traffic congested city in the world for 2 year in a row now
        -   **No round the clock water & electricity supply**- vacuum results in water pollution and other drainage issues; **Inadequate** of **medical care**
    -   **Pollution**: such as land fills, discharge of untreated wastes into rivers, air pollution (India is home to 15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world)
        -   Rapid urbanisation, inefficient waste management and encroachment have turned the **Mahananda River into a drain (waste from Siliguri city), poor condition of Yamuna highlighted by NGT**
    -   **Governance & finance issue**- lack of motivation in ULB staff'; As per Urban Governance Index 2020, **no state has devolved the all 18 functions** mentioned in 12th schedule to their city govts; Urban Governance issue **include deficits of** ‚óè Accountability ‚óè Empowerment ‚óè Financing ‚óè Resources
        -   Institutional capacity of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) remains a persistent challenge. Financial autonomy, taxation powers and fund generation capabilities are the areas of concern
            -   **Finance**- India **3%** municipal revenue share in total revenue but China 25% **(25% = 5-2 = 3%)**; **Reasons**- Irregular updatation of circle rates leading to low municipal revenue; Undervaluation, incomplete registers, policy inadequacy, and inaccurate property tax rolls; Lack of clear/stable policy framework eg: lack of clear policies regarding land acquisition dissuade pvt sector participation
            -   Urban Financing Issues: , Lack of coordination between different levels of government, Property tax collections in India constitute 0.2% of GDP vs 3% in developed nation, Limited government budget/bureaucratic delays/corruption
        -   Lacks Foresight/Expansion without proper planning: eg: Mumbai expanding to suburbs but basic infra such as absence of drainage leading to flooding
        -   Urban Planning is top-down and often aloof to local context
        -   Definition of Urban is not same for centre & state - leading to diversion of resources
    -   Health issues: life style related diseases are increasing in urban areas; Current means of urbanisation & modernisation have brought with them issues of mental health (mental disorders are higher in developed southern states compared to northern states)
    -   Rural Bias: For eg- allocation for rural component of the Swachh Bharat Mission is about seven times more than for urban areas; urban support under the National Health Mission is just 3% of the total allocation
    -   **Negative fallouts of Urbanisation on rural areas:** Declining investment in agriculture, Urban-rural gap in per capita income, Brain drain, Decline in traditional arts and craft, Adoption of urban culture in rural areas
    -   Misc Problems: **Crimes increasing** due to **gaps in aspirations & resources (Delhi crime capital**); **Migration leading to alienation of ppl and mental health issues**; Misgovernance leading to poor tax collections**; Waste mgmt issues land fills**; Poor metro network compared to global cities
-   #### Govt measures
    -   **Smart Cities Program**: Mission covers **100 cities** for the duration of five years until FY20. Objective is to promote cities that **provide core infrastructure** and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of Smart Solutions. Three ways would be used: **Retrofitting, Redevelopment, Greenfield** development
        -   +ves: 5100+ **projects worth Rs. 2 lakh crore had been identified in 100 cities**, of which 81% are tendered and 31% are complete; ‚Äò**Predictive modelling‚Äô** being used such as predict future real estate hotspots, accident hotspots in the city,.etc; **Smart City Index has been launched**
        -   -ves: only 69 projects were for health infrastructure; **Negligible focus on job creation**; **Focused on Class I cities (1 lakh+) that already had relatively better infrastructure**, thus ignoring smaller town (b/w 20k-1lakh ‚Üí Ironic when whole burden of reverse migration was borne by smaller towns); Smart city planning must be democratised so that all members of society, not just those with access to the internet, have a say in the process; Overall As per MoHUA, out of ~4700 projects only 1638 have been completed
        -   Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) are being operated under aegis of SPV rather than ULB staff; There is poor integration of services offered by ULB on the ICCC (thus currently ICCC are splintered nerve centres)
    -   AMRUT 2015: To ensure that every household has access to a tap with the assured supply of water and a sewerage connection. Along with that focus will be on developing greenery and well maintained open spaces and reducing pollution by switching to public transport/non-monitorised transport
        -   Target was for urban renewal in 500 cities by 2020, extended upto 2021
        -   AMRUT has made states equal partners in planning and implementation of projects by approval of SAAP once a year by MoHUA and states have to give project sanctions and approval at their end, therefore actualisation of cooperative federalism
    -   **Jal Jeevan Mission (Urban):** provide universal coverage of water supply to **all households through functional taps** in all **statutory towns** in accordance with **SDG-6 "clean water and sanitation** for all"
        -   Objectives:
            -   Securing tap and sewer connections (to bridge the estimated gap of 2.68 crore urban household **functional water tap connections** and to provide 2.64 crore **sewer connections/septage** in 500 AMRUT cities)
            -   **Rejuvenation of water bodies**: create green spaces and sponge cities to reduce floods and enhance amenity value through an Urban Aquifer Management plan
        -   ‚≠ê**Tools to be used**: IEC campaigns, **Pey Jal Survekshan** (Survey for equitable distribution), By reducing **non-revenue water to below 20%**, **Recycling** used water to **meet at least 20% of total city water** demand, Raising funds through issuance of municipal bonds
        -   Funding will depend on population of cities and funds from centre will be released in tranches based on outcomes
    -   PMSVANidhi: Launched by MoHUA, it will provide collateral free working capital loan of up to Rs. 10,000 to street vendors, which is repayable in monthly instalments within a year. On timely/early repayment of the loan, an interest subsidy of 7% per annum will be credited to the bank accounts of beneficiaries through direct benefit transfer on a six monthly basis.
    -   Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana: to counter the issues of urban slums, urban poor, etc. Mission is being implemented during 2015- 2022 and will provide central assistance to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs); 4 components: **In-situ Rehabilitation of existing slum dwellers** using land as a resource through private participation; Credit Linked Subsidy; Affordable Housing in Partnership; **Subsidy for Beneficiary-led individual house construction**/enhancement
    -   **‚ÄòNagar Van‚Äô or Urban Forest scheme:** envisages creating forests in 200 urban cities across the country in next five years through multistakeholder approach and using funds from CAMPA (Pune‚Äôs Warje forest offers a good model for growth)
    -   DAY-NULM for Skill dev, help urban poor to setu up emp avenues, HRIDAY (rejuvenate heritage cities)
    -   MoHUA- Swatch bharat survekshan survey, municipal perf index for competitive growth among cities
-   #### Way forward
    -   #### ARC 6th report on Urban Governance Reforms
        -   ULB take resp of water supply, power distribution in their area for better citizen centric delivery
        -   Seperate cadre for city admin
        -   Population over 1 lakh cities- PPP for collection and disposal of garbage
        -   Unified Metropolitan Transport authorities set up for million plus cities- for coordinated planning and imp of urban transport solutions
    -   **National Urban Policy Framework** by Mohua 2018
        -   Housing- address neglect of rental housing issue wrt archaic laws, **Niti- Model tenancy law**, **Floor space index inc so that more floors**- more housing with adequate safety audits
            -   **High stamp duty**- more black money in real estate- high prices- so work with **state to reduce it**
        -   **Inclusive cities**- consider issues of poor and **low income groups (LIG),** High standards for parking, reservation in health centres, discrimination should be adressed
        -   **Financing**- ULB devolution, **unleash internal revenue through monetising land assets**, property tax, user charges, insert local bodies list in 7th schedule
            -   **NITI Aayog- ULB municpal bonds (enjoy tax free status)**, standardised and timely financial management
            -   **Best Practice:** States like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh **levy impact fee** and collect it upfront while granting development permission. This can serve as an **important** **revenue-generating tool** especially in the newer developing townships;
        -   **ICT**- smart city control centres wrt traffic, emergency, public light mgmt
        -   Planning- Make urban planning a respected function, innovative and green planning, Implementable master plans **inc both peri urban areas, Rurban integration, gender perspective** in planning **(pink autos, pink buses, coaches)**, **Cascaded planning (long term vision with immediate targets)**
        -   Sanitation
            -   **NITI- explore idea Waste to energy corporation of India** under MoHUA for setting up world class **W2E PPP projects** across the country- target 100 smart cities
        -   Traffic- strict enforcement through fines, sharing systems-car pooling, Ola, cycle lanes, intelligent transort, **car pooling, smart vehicles**
    -   Others:
        -   Newer models of development: Transport oriented model of development where transport is built first and houses, education, hospital etc are linked with it rather than vice-versa
    -   Best Practices:
        -   **Kerala government** runs **Ayyankali Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme** (AUEGS) for guaranteed employment; In 2021, 100 crore Urban Employment Scheme also started by Tamil Nadu
        -   **Himachal Pradesh launched** Mukhya Mantri **Shahri Ajeevika** Guarantee Yojana - providing **120 days of guaranteed wage** employment
        -   China‚Äôs has policy for factory provided dormitory accomodation which makes the Industrial cities slum free
        -   Asia‚Äôs Largest Bio-methanisation plant launched by Indore
        -   **Mahila Milan** brought together **3500 women across Pune slums to redevelop slums** as well as fulfill credit needs through SHGs
        -   Local govts. in china compete among themselves to offer excellent infra and attract investments
        -   Mukuru, Nairobi (one of largest slum dev of Africa) was redeveloped using people participation and customised SOPs
-   Conclusion: Urban spaces need not to be only the centre of economic growth, we also need to make them spaces of cultural activity and social transformation
-   #### Rural-urban integration, schemes, benefits, issues
    -   **Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM)** was launched in **2016 by M/o Rural Development** aimed at developing such rural areas by **provisioning of economic, social and physical infrastructure** facilities
    -   Large parts of **rural areas in the country are not stand-alone** settlements **but part of a cluster** of settlements. These **clusters once developed** can then be classified as **'Rurban'.**
    -   A predecessor to SPMRM was the Provision of Urban Amenities to Rural Areas (PURA), announced in 2003. There are **2 categories of Rurban clusters**: Non-Tribal and Tribal
    -   Under the **mission 300 Rurban clusters are envisaged** to be developed in a time bound manner. Spurred by the success of Rurban clusters, **NITI** **Aayog** has **proposed a new and extended programme** for over a **1,000 clusters** in next 3 years.
    -   **Pradhan Manthri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY):** Core scheme which aims to provide all weather road connectivity in the rural areas
-   #### Way forward for rural-urban integration
    -   **Leveraging Technology** for Self-reliant Village: 650,000-plus existing villages should be smart with ICT integration, create a rural knowledge platform through active collaboration between the public and private sector- cutting edge technology deeper into villages and generate employment.(eg using AI for smart agri); **CSC, National Broadband Mission**
    -   Ensuring **Financial Autonomy: ‚ÄòAtmanirbhar Village bonds‚Äô** could be issued to raise resources, PSL for smart villages
    -   **Training Youth**: create a fresh curriculum in engineering, medical colleges and business schools to train the young workforce to operate in rural areas; **Need specialised measures for rural and urban youth separately (Public Library Movt in Jamatara Distt)**
    -   **Adequate care of village needs in master plans** by taking into account needs of neighbouring villages- providing advanced facilities at outskirts of city, edu inst in rural areas for induced developement.
    -   To ease pressure on cities- smaller towns with city like facilites which are regionally diversified in hook and corner of country for balanced dev
    -   Gandhi dream of Ram rajya, APJ PURA, **Nanaji Deshmukh - idea of self reliant villages** (**Bharat Ratna recently**) based on integral humanism (imp by him in 500 villages in India, especially in the **Chitrakoot area**(Satna Dist-MP),- **zero unemployment, no one below the poverty line**, zero internal legal disputes, **no widow being denied remarriage)**
    -   **Conclusion**: A city can grow only if its villages sustain and vice-versa. **Urbanisation can be prevented from turning ugly not by keeping people away from cities but by taking cities to where people already live**.
-   #### Env issues of urban life- air pollution, urban heat islands, urban floods (see env content)- focus city specific
    -   Issues: (think at all levels air, water, land, disaster, waste mgmt, health)
        -   Urban Heat Islands (micro climate phenomenon) are coming up in cities where average temperature is greater than 2 degree celcius as compared to suburban or rural areas (Eg: Bangalore, Hyderbad)
            -   Mumbai lost 40% of its green cover b/w 1991 & 2018 (Report by Aligarh Muslin Univ and others) ‚Üí led to 2 degree rise ‚Üí Urban heat island
        -   **Urban floods** have become common due to loss of floodplains, lakes and peri-urban wetlands to encroachment;
        -   Internationally it has been recognised that desertification is a major problem particularly due to increased urbanisation
        -   **Air pollution** related issues where rural environments are generally cleaner than urban areas. Quote relevant stats from air pollution content in environment
        -   Huge quantities of **garbage generated by the cities** which are posing a serious health problem
        -   Issues such as **groundwater pollution** and persistent water crisis. Various cities failed the **BIS parameters; Concretisation of ground leading to impact of Rf; Man-Animal Conflicts (leopard encroaching urban areas)**
        -   Lifestyle diseases such as diabetes (other factors diet quality, physical activity levels)
        -   Sub Urbanisation: New trend of people moving away from congested urban areas to cleaner areas outside the city
    -   #### Best Practices:
        -   **Urban Forestry Case Study:** Hyderabad recognised at Tree City by FAO, et al; Programme of Hyderbad is Haritha Haram Program
        -   Ways to tackle: **Implement India Cooling Action Plan**, write schemes for each issue above
-   #### PYQs on Urbanization
    -   2019: How is efficient and affordable urban mass transport leading to rapid economic development (15 marks)
        -   1. Problems in urban transport- congestion leading to long travel time, high parking charges as well as no parking spaces, unlike west- insensible driving, accidents- hesitancy with good samaritan, air pollution etc
        2. **Imp of urban mass transport-** improved GDP- faster inputs, **connectivity to outer city, reduce congestion- save time and fuel, women friendly**, **more leisure hours-less stress**, **ancillary employment near stations**, **less carbon emmision**, cheaper city life - can live outside if good transport (suburbanisation-delhi, mumbai eg);
        -   **Skill development, Labour Mobility**
        -   1. Take example of how 4 metro cities of India are running greatly due to urban transport
        -   **Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) in various cities for example in Indore; Metro Rails, Mono rail in Bombay**
        -   1. Newer options such **Metro lite and Metro Neo** (run on roads) being explored - (**Budget 2021**); **Hyper-Loop under consideration**
        2. Govt efforts
        -   **National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) - plans to increase share to at least 50 percent of all motorized trips using public transport**
        -   1. **FAME** (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of **Electric Vehicles**), **Green Mobility Fund,** High-speed trains and the proposed Hyperloop connectivity
        2. **Transit Oriented Development - results in improved access to transit facilities**- encourage citizen to prefer walking and choosing public transport over using private vehicles.
        -   1. WF- Need for smart and intelligent transort- manage traffic lights efficiently, catch rash drivers through command centres, traffic services in peak hours through radio; **Number plate technology**
    -   2017: ‚ÄúThe growth of cities as I.T. hubs has opened up new avenues of employment, but has also created new problems‚Äù. Substantiate this statement with examples. [Urban Areas (in context of IT Hubs) problems and avenues] - Human geography
        -   1. Basic problems and way forward above
        2. **+ves:** Agglomeration effect, Upskilling, Ancillary services have been developed; Affected by WFH culture
        -   #### Examples
            -   1. **Bangalore- expansion led to encroachment of wetlands**, **lakes polluted**- white foam on roads, flash floods, mass exodus of north east people; water shortage; **Congested housing in Delhi NCR**
            2. Noida, Gurugram- **traffic issues**, inc in land prices, women crimes due to clash of modern and traditional ideology; **Sex ratio being biased**
            3. **Hyderabad**- inc drug abuse, **e-waste**
            4. Urban heat islands, other environmental issues
            5. **Mumbai**- **Son of the soil** issues
    -   2016: With a brief background of quality of urban life in India, introduce the objectives and strategy of the ‚ÄòSmart City Programme‚Äô.
        -   1. Covered above
    -   2015: Smart cities in India cannot sustain without smart villages. Discuss this statement in the backdrop of rural urban integration. [Rurbanization - Need for smart villages (backdrop rural-urban integration)]
        -   1. Covered above
    -   GS-2: 2013: basis PURA Scheme rooted in estb connectivity? Aim? Currently transformed to Rurban Mission
        -   1. PURA concept by APJ Abdul Kalam
        2. His vision was to develop rural India through a cluster development system where 50-100 villages with common competencies and/or mutual markets could be horizontally or vertically integrated as PURA complexes
        3. These villages would be linked through ‚Äúfour connectivities‚Äù ‚Äî physical, electronic, knowledge and economic.
        4. The goal was to provide income and quality of life to all within PURA complex.
        5. While this model would promote some rural-rural migration would be acceptable, rural to urban migration would be minimised.
        6. Bridge R-Ugap- provide physical,social,tech infra in R, use PPP mode resp for urban level water supply, street lightening
    -   2015: Air pollution in Delhi vs Kolkata vs Mumbai; Solutions
        -   1. According to air quality data compiled by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Delhi is the world‚Äôs most polluted city
        2. Reasons:
            1. Delhi has more than 9 million registered vehicles. Further, vehicles from the neighboring states entering in to Delhi are also very high
            2. **Stubble Burning issues**: where wind carries all the pollutants and dust particles, which get locked in the air
            3. Industrial pollution and **coal based power plants** in Delhi and surrounding areas cause pollution in the air
            4. NCR region is **land-locked** thus **pollution cannot dissipate quickly** as in coastal cities like Mumbai or Chennai
            5. **Large-scale construction** in Delhi-NCR leading to dust and pollution in the air
        3. Response: **Graded Response Action Plan**, Happy Seeder, **National Clean Air Programme**, **BS-VI, Green Tax**, **Switch Delhi Policy** to promote electronic vehicles, Judical actions banning crackers, etc.; **New Commission for Air Quality Management in the NCR**
    -   2013: Social problems due to speedy urbanisation process (do for all PESTEL)
        -   1. Covered above
    -   2007: Growing problems of Slums: Nature and causes
        -   1. Basics covered above
        2. Causes: Improper city planning, Pvt. developers not interested in affordable houses, Failure of state govts to implement National Urban housing & habitat policy 2007 which says every year 15% of land will be allocated for social housing; Inflated prices due to demand supply imbalance;
        3. Urbanisation of Pandemic: Animal human interface, 10 cities account for half COVID Cases, Urbanised nations most urbanised

## Population and associated issues

-   **2024:** Read only next 3 yellow paras below then 
-   üí∏: Popu as an asset (if HRD ‚úî, labour supply, huge market), Role of disapora (remittances, diplomacy); Hetrogenous nature of DD in India; Dual burden on state (old age+ still keep giving jobs); Population Pyramid can be drawn (to show bulge); **Eco Survey - DD by 2041 peak (and overall population to peak at 2061); Youth bulge** (need to tap this dividend; where working > dependent population); China (retirement age inc, primary school converted to old age nursing, huge exp on social capital), High economic growth and sex ratio not relative (Punjab,Haryana,Guj), Son-meta pref; When world is ageing, it needs India
    -   **Schemes** (family planning, chaya/antara contraception 88% data, universal immunisation, Jaya Jaitley Cmt - pushing age up) **Swaminathan Cmt** (Reproductive autonomy for women, universal immunisation, Elderly geriatric care, Women led family planning, Streamlining adoption process), **Development is the best contraceptive, UP unveils New Population Policy 2021-30 (targets low TFR);**
    -   **Migrants**: 450 mn (Census 2011); Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, 1979 (register migrant worker, license lab contractors - low followed as per Std Commt of Lab, JH survey, NITI - migration at part of dev, Code of Social security), Women 70% migrants
-   Prepare few graphs from the data if possible as question from population has high chances!!
-   #### Facts and trends in population in India and world
    -   India **17% of world population**, pop density 382/per sq km (Bihar 1106, Delhi NCT 11,320, Arun P 17)
    -   67% of population in working age (15-64), 1 in 4 worker- Indian
    -   India has entered a **demographic sweet spot** (**65% population below 35**) which will continue for 2-3 decades ; **Median age 29 years;**
    -   UN Report (2022) India will cross China as the world's most populous country by 2023 itself 2027 (and remain the **world‚Äôs most populous country till 2100); Become most populous as per UN Population Fund in 2023**
    -   At present, India hosts around 16-17% of the world‚Äôs population, with only 2.45% of the global surface area and 4% of the water resources
-   #### Trend:
    -   1901- 21: High BR, High DR- stagnant growth
    -   1921-51 : High BR, Moderate DR- steady growth
    -   **1951- 81-** High BR, Low DR- led to Pop explosion+ **International migrants incoming**
    -   1981- currently- Moderate BR, Low DR- pop growth slowing down but still huge
    -   Population Pyramid- age sex structure- no. of male and female in diff age groups
    -   P seen as liabilty as an hindrance to dev (or puts pressure on resources) however can be asset (when **HR is transformed into Human capital consisting of eco/soc/cul capital**) too- eg Indian diaspora influence in foreign countries
    -   World population- 7.3B- 50.4% male,49.6%F, 60% in Asia
        -   Africa fastest growing in population followed by Asia
        -   Europe, Japan shrinking population- population ageing
    -   Post NEP 1991 there has been a socioeconomic tranformation in the way family is planned by Indians (which has led to low fertility rate) ie. Where farmers used to see more workers when they saw their children, the new aspirational parents invest more money in their fewer children by sending them to private schools and coaching classes
-   Global Trends of population growth density, factors influencing
    -   **Historical Data**: World population grew from 1 billion in 1800 to 8 billion in 2022
    -   **Projections**: UN projects 9.7 billion by 2050 (thus **ensuring food security** while **preserving environmental resources is paramount**)
    -   **Regional density rise**: Asia's high density due to India and China; Low density in Aus, Canada
    -   **Urbanization affects distribution**: Tokyo, with over 37 million people, exemplifies urban density. even **Mumbai**
    -   **Migration afffects density**: Syrian refugee crisis impacting Europe.
    -   BR, DR, Migration - all effect population growth
    -   Addressing these challenges requires a **holistic approach**, integrating **sustainable development**, **improved healthcare and education**, and effective **migration policies**
-   Factors influencing distribution of P (PYQ 1991)
    -   Geographical
        -   Availabilty of water- river valley densely populated (Ganga valley, Indus valley) compared to deserts
        -   Landform- flat plains (suits agri along with water) over mountains
            -   Soil- fertile imp for agri
        -   Climate- not extreme hot or cold
    -   Economical
        -   Minerals- attract industries- better emp eg Bokaro, Jamshedpur
        -   Industralisation- Ind belts, corridors attract people
        -   Urbanisation- City life etc
    -   Socio-cultural
        -   Religious or cultural significance attract, social/pol unrest repels
-   #### Characteristics of Indian Demography 
    -   **TFR** (no of child women have in their fertility age) All india- 2.3, **24 (state+UT) achieved replacement level 2.1** but high in states such as Bihar-3.4, UP 3.1, MP 2.9, Jharkhand 2.7 etc (Lowest states- WB-1.6, Delhi,Punjab,TN,HP- 1.7, Kerela- 1.8)
        -   **TFR as per NFHS-5 has reached 2.0; Inc in adoption of contraceptives (as highlighted by NFHS-5); _BH, UP, MP, etc are above around 3 TFR_**
        -   #### Other data from NFHS-5: Sex Ratio 1020, Institutional deliveries 88% (from 78%)
        -   However, TFR remains higher than national avg of 2.2 among women in rural areas/having little formal edu/part of lowest income quintile
    -   **MMR**- **Declined to MMR 97 as per SRS Bulletin (18-20)** from 122 in 2015-17 as per SRS - Assam 215, **MP 173** (60 above prev national avg of 113) and Kerela 43, TN 60)
    -   **Life expectancy** rose from 37 (1950) to **~70 years (2020);**
    -   **IMR- Current IMR - 27/1000 (2021), SDG Target 12**/1000 currently (Kerela- 10, MP- 47 (Highest); **Under 5 Child Mortality Rate = 38/**1000
    -   #### Sex Ratio and Child Sex Ratio
        -   Sex Ratio - Census 2011 data: Overall was 943 from 933 in prev census; The number of females per 1000 males in Haryana in Census 2011 stands at 879 followed by Jammu and Kashmir (889 female) and Punjab (895 females)
        -   Manipur = worst (757); Arunachal Pradesh 1084 = best (SRS 2018)
        -   Child Sex Ratio ‚è¨‚è¨‚è¨ unabated since 1951 ‚è¨‚è¨‚è¨
    -   The median age increased for men ‚Äì from 22.6 (2001) to 23.5 (2011) and for women ‚Äì from 18.2 (2001) to 19.2 (2011)
    -   While a state like Kerala is beginning to acquire an age structure like that of the developed countries, Uttar Pradesh presents a very different picture with high proportions in the younger age groups and relatively low proportions among the aged (thus our whole demo dividend is coming at diff times in diff places ~ hetrogenous nature)
    -   SECC Data 2011
        -   Total households 24.39 crore households in India, of which 17.91 crore live in villages. Of these, 10.69 crore households are considered as deprived
        -   In nearly 75 per cent of the rural households, the main earning family member makes less than Rs 5,000 per month

            -   **Children**- **Boys-** large family have to **start working early**, **Girls**- worst sufferer- **low edu, early marriage-** vicious cycle continues; scapegoating treatment recd by extra child
            -   Poor standard of living, hygeine issues, pandemic worst effects
            -   Social norms need to change and the stabilisation strategy needs to keep rights of women & girls in mind (coercive methods have not worked for long anywhere)
        -   Economy

        -   Political & Security- more chances of **instability** going violent as limted armed forces **(Agniveer Protests)**; Dev imbalance **promoted naxalism**
        -   International- **diaspora benefits**, more weight in diplomacy
        -   Mass media- Indianisation of culture, foreign youtubers making indian content
    -   Under population, Issues of advanced countries
        -   Ageing so more dependent- **huge social security, small work force**- limted exp of resources (russia far east)
-   **Population policies, Measures for control** (read bold)
    -   #### Mission Parivar Vikas- inc access to contraceptives and family planning services in 146 districts of TFR more than 3

        -   Push up marriage of girls
        -   Also inviting pvt healthcare for sterlisation
    -   **ASHA couselling** to newly married for **spacing between births** (eg have 3 yr gap after 1st child)
    -   #### Jaya Jaitley Task Force recommended to push up age of marriage
    -   **Two child norms by states such as Assam,** MP, Raj which prohibit persons having more than 2 children to obtain govt job, **disqualify candidate from panchayat elections**
        -   (-) Neglect HR, against art 14 more pressure of women due to son pref
    -   #### Success of Govt Measures: mention data from NFHS-5
-   Recent demographic trends:
    -   TFR declined from 5.6 (1969) to 2.3 (currently) - steep decline reaching 1.3 in 2100 (inc in female edu and access to contraceptives major factor)
    -   #### TFR ‚¨á is ‚Üí Sign of Ageing (also use in old age Qs): Issues on neglect of geritic care, inc dependents, double burden on govt (jobs+social security), Challenges brought by wealth management, insurance
    -   **Socio-eco transformation has been observed since 1990s** where earliers parents/farmers saw children has working hands to now **new aspirational parents wants to invest in their kids** (sending to coaching, coding, etc). This has led to **shift in family building strategies leading to low fertility rate**
-   Policies in News
    -   UP‚Äôs new draft policy, Assam‚Äôs population policy
-   Way forward
    -   **Harnessing the demographic dividend**- dev HR-edu, skill dev, **occupational health for working population**, Labour intensive jobs need to be promoted, creating fiscal space for more investments, **diplomatic efforts for international migration** (**provide human resource to the world**- H1B etc) as 2041 DD will peak and working age will reduce
    -   **Striving towards gender parity**- overcoming son meta pref, equal pay, higher edu for addressing issues of female foeticide, inc FLFP, **better implementation of women property rights law**
    -   **Elderly focus**- greater spending on pensions, geriatric care (focus on NCD‚Äôs), inc age of retirement, meet needs of widows as life exp of W higher, **Harness Silver Economy**
    -   Policies acc to state demography rather than one size fits all
    -   Increasing financial commitment to family planning, sustaining coverage of 10 cr women using contraceptives, attract doc to family planning field, include men in family planning awarness prog,
    -   Key to reduce IMR, MMR is to follow **birth spacing of atleast 3 years**
    -   Handling interstate and R-U migration- population control prog in high fertility regions, **RURBAN dev**, also decent life to urban migrants esp LIG
    -   To unleash the full potential of the young population, **policies must focus on the population development approach** (i.e. better education, better health services, skill development and better standard of living), in order to reap the benefits of demographic dividend (rather than population control)
    -   It is often said that ‚Äú**development is the best contraceptive**‚Äù. **Current Happenings:**
        -   **UP unveils** New Population Policy 2021-30 with **Target of TFR 2.1 by 2026** and 1.9 by 2030
        -   **-ves:** Making welfare conditional is seen as coercion; Puttaswamy Judgement said person's autonomy over her body as an extension to right to privacy (the bill will undermine reproductive freedom); **Sex ratio might become skewed further**(due to aborting daughters to avoid disincentives); Similarly experience shows sterilization camps have disparate impact on minorities and vulnerable groups;
        -   Counter-productive: Studies have found that **men divorced their wives in RJ/MP to** **run for local body elections** and families **gave up children for adoption** to avoid disqualification **in states of RJ, MP**(where 2 child norms were established)
        -   It must not result into what happened in **China** which now mandated **Three Child Policy**
    -   **Conclusion: Development is the best contraceptive -** provide health services, literacy & eliminate poverty
-   #### Migration (cover both internal and international)
    -   Migration refers to geographical mobility between one region & another involving change of residence for considerable period of time; Facilitated by Article 19(1)(d)
    -   Census of india captures definition based on 2 factors: place of birth & place of usual residence
    -   Types of migration:
        -   Based on destination: Internal (intra-state, inter-state) & International
        -   Based on duration: Permanent, Semi-permanenet (forced back due to eco reasons), Temporary/seasonal (voluntary & not forced)
    -   #### Facts on Migration
        -   Total internal migration as per Census 2011 was ~450 mn or every third indian is a migrant (this includes 396 mn as intra-state & 54 mn as inter-state); According to experts, current data is around 600 mn (of which 10% is inter-state)
        -   As of 2011, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were the largest source of inter-state migrants while Maharashtra and Delhi were the largest receiver states
        -   When question on migration cover both domestic as well as International
        -   R-R is largest in absolute number; Increased % is being seen in R-U; **Intra state migration is 4 times of inter-state**; U-R is a new concept marked as counter migration
    -   Causes (pull or push)
        -   Political/Governance:
            -   Pull: **Political freedom** & increased political participation, safety & security
            -   Push: **Failure of govt to implement schemes**, violence, corruption, **poor governance**, displacement of tribes due to development (eg: dams)
        -   Economic:
            -   Pull: Better infra, **skill dev**, Industrialisation, **Counter-magnets** (eg: **greater noida** built to ease pressure on delhi)
            -   Push: **Agri distress**, Decline in village indus, **lack of alternate employment** opportunities
        -   Socio-cultural:
            -   Pull: **Urbanism** leading to **annoymity of caste**, Liberal policies towards marriages/family values
            -   Push: **Division of labour based on caste**, **Patriachy**, Differentiated access to resources due to ethinic/religios/linguistic issues, **Marriage push women** to other areas
        -   New concept of Push-BackFactors:
            -   Eco:
                -   -ve: Congestion in urban areas, High cost of living, ltd. income opportunities
                -   +ve: Commercialisation of agri, Govt schemes in rural area
            -   Soc-cul:
                -   -ve: Ghettoization, Lack of cultural integration, COVID
                -   +ve: Feeling of nativism, Family reunification
            -   Pol:
                -   -ve: Son of the soil policy, state led persecution
                -   +ve: Strengthening of local governance
    -   #### Consequences (Source, Destination, Migrants)
        -   Economic Impact:
            -   On Source Region: Allows source region to employ **greater focus on reduced population**; Loss of HR if migration is of employable people, however **if migration draws upon surplus labour then win-win** situation**; Benefits of remittances**
            -   On Destination Region: Proliferation of **slums** due to mismgmt (as infra part of economics); **Stress on limited eco resources** such as jobs/investment/opportunities
        -   Socio-cultural Impact:
            -   On Source Region: **Newer ideas of social change** such as tech/family planning gets diffused to source regions; Problems of dual burden; Absence of adults may cause dislocation of family; **Violence faced by leftover members**
            -   On Destination Region: Migrants are perceived to take away jobs of locals; **Issues with cultural integration** in some cases (**eg: Outsider movts in NE)** while broadening of mental horizons due to intermixing (ex in case of delhi)
        -   Political Impact:
            -   On Source Region: **Political participation** in activities of source region will **decline (can‚Äôt vote)**
            -   On Destination Region: Regional parties can mobilise natives; **Son of soil policy**; Migrants can **impact politics of the region** in long term **eg: diaspora of india (don‚Äôt forget international aspects)**
        -   Demographic Impact:
            -   On Source Region: Male specific migration will lead to **feminization of work** and increased probability of child labour; **Decline in birth rate**, **Dependent population increases** (as usually younger ones migrate)
            -   On Destination Region: **Skewed sex ratio**, **increased violence** against vulnerable sections;
        -   #### On Migrants:
            -   +ve: **Social mobility** of status in society; **Social capital** increased **due to networking**; Opportunities for **innovation**; Social tolerance increases when diversity is accommodated
            -   -ve: Devoid of skills/info/power they are caught in **exploitative labour arrangements**; **Hardships increases when inter-state** or distance between source & region increases; **Victims of identity politics**; **Denied social security benefits** (as are out of records); Denied political voice as they **lack voting rights**; **Governance failure to implement Interstate Migrant Workmen Act 1979; Invisible during COVID**
    -   **Govt measures** wrt migration
        -   **Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, 1979: Labour contractors recruiting migrants** are required to: (i) **be licensed**, (ii) **register migrant workers with the government authorities**, and (iii) arrange for the worker to be issued a passbook recording their identity.
            -   A report by the **Standing Committee on Labour 2011** observed that **registration of workers** under the **ISMW Act was low** and implementation of protections outlined in the Act was poor. Report concluded that the Central government had not made any concrete and fruitful efforts
        -   **Food distribution** under Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan
        -   Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan also launched a scheme for
        -   Affordable Rental Housing Complexes for **Migrant Workers** and Urban Poor to provide affordable rental housing units under **PMAY**
        -   **UP** government announced provision of **maintenance allowance of Rs 1,000** for returning migrants.
        -   One Nation One Ration card (Issues: low internet penetration, logistical nightmare for some FPS, dilutes local diet and spcl allocation)
        -   **National Migrant Information System** **(_NMIS_)** - a **central online repository** on Migrant Workers - developed by NDMA; **State of JH decided to conduct _migrant labour survey_**
        -   **Ujjwala 2.0:** For LPG address proff no reqd **only self declaration**; **Ayushman Bharat** is portable All India
    -   #### Way forward
        -   #### Need for a National Policy on Migration
            -   **NITI Aayog** - Draft national policy - nullifies handout approach and prefers a **rights-based framework**, inter-state migration management bodies, sees Migration as part of Development
            -   Interoperability of benefits on lines of One Nation One Ration Card
            -   Legal cells can be created to ensure protection of legal right of migrants
            -   Judicious implemenation of act of 1979, amendments keeping in mind present-day realities of internal migrations
            -   Active participation of NGOs to drive away trust deficits b/w natives and migrants
            -   **Develop source regions** to address issues of over-migration
            -   Collection of **proper and reliable data for data driven policy** formulation/reforms eg: Like **JH Survey**
            -   Need to provide **civic right** of voting through some kind of system maybe **one nation one voter id**
            -   Every Panchayat must have a Migrant Labour Cell; Code on Social Security - Minimum social security to all
            -   The SDGs‚Äô central reference to migration is made in target 10.7, to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies
            -   Direct cash transfers
            -   Universalisation of grain distribution from buffer stocks of FCI
            -   Policy needs to ponder ‚ÄòIs migration really a choice?‚Äô in India
        -   Conclusion: as India adopts a strategy of **rapid urbanisation** ‚Äî for example, by building so-called smart cities and essentially using cities as centres of economic growth ‚Äî **levels of internal migration will increase further; SDG 10.7**
    -   #### International Migration
        -   **In 2011**, 99% of total migration (total migration 45.6 crore or ~450 mn) was internal and immigrants (**international migrants) comprised 1%**
        -   As per World Bank Report, India is the **largest source of migrants** in the world. India remains the **highest international remittances**
    -   #### Internal Migrants
        -   They are part of informal economy outside agriculture and dominate low-paying and hazardous jobs. (eg: construction, rickshaw, small factories)
        -   Why internal migration happens? Cover pull & push factor above
    -   #### Issues related to internal migration:
        -   Cover -ve impact on migrants
        -   **Absence of reliable data** wrt to number and nature of migration - Census and NSS surveys are unable to caputure data
        -   **Lack of education for children** of migrants aggrevates the **intergenerational transmission of poverty**
        -   **Social exclusion** due to differences in **culture/language** of source & destination. They **do not form part of manifestos of trade unions**
        -   Trapped in cycle of poverty as they serve hard manual labour in young age ‚Üí chronic illeness ‚Üí lower earning capacity ‚Üí children start migrating ‚Üí cycle repeats
        -   Additional issues due to COVID-19:
            -   Due to uncertainity and desperation, many migrants left on foot or on overcrowded buses/vans
            -   **Social exclusion in source areas due to fear of virus transmission eg: happened in villages of WB**
            -   Loss of jobs combined leading to deepening of poverty
        -   What can be done? Use way forward points above
    -   **GIG Economy:** No clear definition of UBER Driver (whether self employed or gig); Regular jobs into gig
-   #### PYQs on Population
    -   2015: Discuss the changes in the trends of labour migration within and outside India in the last four decades
        -   1. Trend of migration within India **(context of green revolution, LPG reforms)**
            1. **Inter State Migration (East to West Migration):** migration from eastern part of country which includes UP, Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal or North Eastern states, etc. to western part which includes Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Punjab or Haryana etc
            2. Labours **have attracted due to green revolution**, construction jobs, etc.
            -   Migration to IT Hubs
            -   1. Students are being pulled **for education/employment**
            2. In last four decades, **female migration rate has surpassed the male migration**. In Census 2011, **70% of migrants are females**
            3. Most cited eason for **migration is marriage**; Generally women migrated for marriage where as men for work
        -   1. Trend in Migration outside India
            1. **Increase in migration** was observed specially after **globalisation**
            2. **Kerala, Tamil Nadu, AP and Punjab** mainly accounts for **out-migration to Middle East Asia**. Nature is of **unskilled jobs**
            -   1. Migration to **south eastern nations** has been there; **eastern nations** for support services
            2. Skilled workers have also **migrated to various areas of USA, UK** eg: **IT workers**, R&D workers
            -   1. Estimates of the number of international migrants by sex show that the **volume of international migrants has been nearly equal for both men and women**
            2. **Less opportunities in home country** eg: medical students going to Ukraine
    -   2019: Empowering W key to control population growth. Discuss
        -   1. **First issues of over-population** (India to take over China by 2027)
        2. Then causes focussing on W- given above
        -   Then women emp
        -   1. **Education**- **no misinfo about contraceptives**, can counter unreasonable family demands of son pref induced births, family planning wrt no.
            2. **Health**- better reproductive and maternal health- less IMR issues
            3. **Eco**- influence DM powers, role of SHG, not dependent financially
            4. **Pol**- more women in parliament- effect on subjugated women to speak up
            5. **Social- counter patriarchy through media**, awareness etc
        -   1. Mention govt scheme such BBBB and conclude
        2. Cover both angles of yes as well as no (**in ‚Äòno‚Äô list factors two other factors also need to be addressed** and not just women emp)
    -   Sex Ratio: Causes, region wise analysis, solution, way fwd
        -   1. Data above; Quote highest and lowest state
        2. Causes- **Son pref (perform last rites**, lineage and property to sons, **look after parents** in old age), exorbitant **dowry**, Ineffective regulation of **PCPNDT** working, parent feel **difficult to keep girl safe-** society pressure if not agree to marry with their choice
            1. **Easy sex selection test**- High Female foeticide
            2. **High economic growth and sex ratio not relative** (Punjab,Haryana,Guj etc)- basic causes, rich have less kids- so prefer son- ultra sound, patriarchy whereas south -more female autonomy so better SR, migration of men to prosper
            -   **In states like Punjab, Haryana even Child sex ratio is low- shows men migration to these prosperous region cant be said to be reason for low SR**
        -   1. Govt efforts
            1. PCPNDT act- bans sex determination
            2. **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao** (national campaign to address low Child SR districts- success- **Mau (Uttar Pradesh)** from 694 (2014-15) to 951 (2019-20), **Karnal** (Haryana) from 758 (2014-15) to 898 (2019-20)), **initiatives such as beti janmotsav, better inst delivery**, inc GER in edu, building toilets)
            -   1. **Sukanya Samridhhi**, Scheme for adolescent girls for not letting parent take them as burden

    -   2015: Comparison of sex ratio in SCs and STs
        -   1. **Child sex ratio for ST- 957, for SC- 933**, Overall- 919
        2. Why better in ST?
            1. Limited Social bias against W, **matriarchy in many tribes (Garo, etc)**, women can ask for divorce in many tribes (**matrilocal in meghalaya; matrilineal society in Nair tribe Kerela**)
            -   **Less rigid sexual division of labour, thus women is not seen as economic burden**
            -   1. **SCs** are being subject to **sanskritisation** whereas **STs** are **isolated** from this impact
            -   1. However can also be **due to limited awareness** about sex selection **techniques**
            2. Rather than dowry, **bride price is more prevalent in STs**
            3. Recent trends show that SR in ST also declining (could be edu effect)
            4. Why others more- covered in prosperous region SR above
    -   2015: Growing Population cause of poverty or poverty main cause of growing population. Critically examine
        -   1. Population cause of poverty- **pressure on resources**, **limited govt spending and services**, un emp and under emp, high population-**inadequate edu- low skill dev** (here population is seen as liability thus seen leading to poverty)
        -   1. Poverty cause of population- **lack of family planning and contraceptives**, **low edu health unwantedpregnanices**, other basic points above in causes of population
            1. _High income states have low TFR_ **whereas** _Low income states- Bihar,MP have high TFR (shows poverty population linkage)_
        -   2. Write way forward to tackle both poverty and population
    -   1994: National Population Policy
        -   1. Covered above

    -   **Colonial Mentality** - **Continuing** (sitting judge of Madras HC was denied entry in a club in Tamil Nadu as he was wearing a traditional Indian wear; Infatuation with foreign brand names ‚ÄòPeter England‚Äô; Preference is given to western allopathic system) **Given Up** (Rajpath renamed as Kartvya path + Islands; SC Bose on India Gate; Tribal circuits, Buddhist circuits) **Way Ahead** (Academic research needs to be reoriented towards Indian perspectives rather than colonial glaze over caste; Adpot good of west and reject patronising aspects; Use tech to preserve heritage AI for translation of sanskrit manuscript)
    -   #### Mosaic Model (blend of Melting Pot vs Salad Bowl) eg: Urban centres are melting pot whereas tribal areas are salad bowl
    -   #### Indian society includes the following common values: Family values (family ties, touching feet); Spiritual practices (fasts, Roja, Vrata); Ecological values (sacred groves, nature worship)
    -   **Joint Family System -** Family as inst is elsewhere also but Joint family is unique to India; family imp unlike W (leaves parent home)
    -   #### Unity in diversity

            -   **Occupational mobility**- **Brahmin become traders**, Vaishya in teachings
        -   #### Factors/forces affecting changes in caste system (Ways in which caste is taking backseat) - MUG-LIME
            -   **Sanskritisation** by **MN Srinivas**- lower caste claming higher position in society by **changing rituals** such as **adopting veg** and teetotalism
            -   Westernisation- changes in edu, movies, dressing sense, insta influencing
            -   Modernisation- inc rationalism in the new middle class (modern values system are questioning the hierarchy based on birth/ascriptive status) Note: Hierarchy per se is not bad but it should be based on achieved status rather than on birth/ascriptive status
            -   **Industralisation** (Indus is **challenging concept of occupational DoL** as all are now working under same roof)
                -   Occupational DoL - Division of people in society according to occupations or trades
            -   Urbanisation (New food habits- eating at same table; due to annoymity/heterogenity is promoting secular pattern of living)

                -   Joint famlies fell from 19% to 16% (2011) (dip sharper in rural (from 20%to 16%) compared to urban (16.5% to 14.5%)
            -   Space
                -   North- mostly patrilineal, no M within same gotra
                -   South- complicated pattern, dominance of patrilineal but also matrilineal, varying rules of marriage
                -   N-E- matrilineal tribes

    -   Women
        -   Issues etc (will be covered below)
    -   Religious pluralism
        -   Issues- covered in communalism
-   1. 2019: What makes the Indian society unique in sustaining its culture? Discuss. [How culture is sustained in Indian society?] - Use **elements of diversity of India as well**
    1. Start with mentioning basic features of Indian society and culture
    2. **Role of ancient rulers** such as Ashoka, Akbar practiced tolerance- **impact on indian culture wrt toleration (unlike Pak- creation of Bang)**
    3. Assimilation of good things of other cultures, Indian culture is like ocean, in which many rivers come and meet- strengthens our culture
    4. **Cultural Lag** where core values are retained while peripheral values are changing
    5. Patronage for arts Eg **Gharana System** (social org linking musicians/dancers) to preserve A&C
    6. **Inst & Festivals: Jaipur literary festival** (literature promotion and preservation); **SPIC MACAY - Youth awareness** for arts n culture; Role of ASI
    7. **Languages -** carry traditional values and stories
    8. **Technolgy: Dhimsa Community Radio** (Koraput) - Local artisans display talents; **Bharat SHRI - Digitalisation of ancient scripts**
    -   Still people draw identities from community; 85% still prefer arranged marriage (Lokniti-CSDS Youth); Still Family as an institution is strong & helps in pattern maintenance
    -   1. **Multiculturalism** (and not just cultural pluralism) where Indian society is a collection of multiple societies forming composite culture and not just common culture
    2. **Hybridization of culture** (**glocalization prevents original culture to just fade off**) where some parts of the culture has evolved while retaining the original parts eg: Resorting to both allopathic and homepathic meds, **Dubbing of Hollywood into local lang, Business Suits made from Saree cloth;** McDonalds not selling beef based products
    3. Political (disobedience culture by - role of democratic/civil rights activists to counter any single culture imposition, F of speech- promotes toleration and individuality, policies of **inclusive growth, Ek bharat Shresth Bharat-** celebration of diversity
    -   **Constitution as binding factor**
    -   1. Smooth transfer of political power- even after emergency/war periods
    -   1. Unity in diversity - other pts
    2. However **challanges in sustaining**- Glob, materilism,regionalist,communalism,other points from factors threatening India‚Äôs diversity.
    3. End with poisitive note
-   1. 2014: The life cycle of a joint family depends on economic factors rather that social values. Discuss. [Joint Family: Life cycle, Present status,]
    1. Joint family is defined as social group consisting of people united by ties of marriage/blood/adoption. It consists of 2 or more generations
    2. Life cycle of JF is not stable consists of disintegration where it becomes nuclear family, reintegration and so on
    3. Economic factors affecting JF life cycle:
        1. Disintegration due to: Industrialsation (better jobs in city), Pressure on Agri (land fragmentation, disguised unemp- move to cities), better civic facilities, lack of jobs/indus in villages
        2. Reintegration due to: high cost of living forcing back countermigration; Child rearing in dual career family becomes diff in nuclear families; As income inc people can sustain JF better, Feeling of nativism; WFH Culture, Death of spouse
    -   1. Social issues such as women becoming more aware of their rights (issues of purdah, clothing,autonomy in JF), family quarrels , conflicts in HUF, influence of west (movies showing nuclear family as norm) also play their role
    -   1. **In most cases**, there is **breakdown of joint households rather than joint families** as we can observe that **_functional jointness_** (eg: celebration, societal cermonies) is still retained. JF needs to evolve with changing dynamics of the society

## Social Empowerment/ Caste Issue

-   #### Social Empowerment
    -   1. SC: Legal, consitutition
    2. ST: Legal, consitutition, why called ST?
        1. The Constitution of India in Article 366 (25) prescribe that the **Scheduled Tribes means such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342** of the Constitution to be Scheduled Tribes.
    -   #### Article 342 (Process of determinsation of STs)
        -   1. It allows the President of India to specify the tribes or tribal communities that are deemed to be Scheduled Tribes in relation to a state or Union Territory.
        2. The President must consult with the Governor of the state before issuing a notification.
        3. Parliament has the power to include or exclude any tribe or tribal community from the list of Scheduled Tribes specified in a notification.
        4. Once a notification is issued, it can be changed only through an Act of Parliament.
    -   #### ADDITIONAL POINTS:
        -   M/o SJ&E developed an online web-portal e-utthaan.gov.in for monitoring of Allocation for Welfare of SCs
        -   Similar portal also developed for STs by Tribal Aff Ministry
    -   ST- debate at independence- Assimilationist Approach (full) or Isolationist
        -   Nehru brought **Tribal Panchsheel for middle path** by giving them basic modern welfare at the same time protecting their identity (Development w/o interference, Preservation of cultural identity, Administrative autonomy to tribals, Preseve tribal r‚Äôship with nature, Avoidance of over administration)
        -   In order to implement policy for these section- idenitifcation of them and placing in Schedule (therefore called ST, SC)
-   #### Caste and Caste System
    -   Refer Caste, Caste System and related aspects at [[Caste system]]
    -   **Features of caste system**: Innate nature (can never change ones caste), Based on **principles of purity and pollution**, Hierarchy, Separation of contact, Occupational division of labour, Caste Solidarity, Sanctioned by ancient texts, Disability for LCs and Priveleges for UCs
    -   Note: Caste covers both SC and OBC
    -   #### Newer forms of caste system:
        -   Social:
            -   **Reservation demand of dominant castes** - new demands for internal reservations, reservation demand of dominant castes such as **Patel, Marathas, Jats**
                -   Dominant caste are feeling relative deprivation - as cannot compete in pvt jobs against upper castes and cannot compete with lower caste as unlike LC, dominant castes do not have reservation benefit (DCs are socially empowered and hold land but still demamding reservation this proves they are having **feeling of relative deprivation**)
            -   Census **2011**: Only **5.8%** of Indian **marriages were inter-caste**, a rate unchanged over 40 years
            -   When rural workers migrate to new areas- look for people of same caste- strenghtening of identity
        -   Political:
            -   Mandalisation of politics- assertion of OBC politics (‚Äòmodern avatar of castes‚Äô)
            -   Politicisation of castes - Earlier SC were being used by upper caste/dominant caste as vote banks
            -   **Castesisation of politics** - Emergence of **new political parties** such as Bahujan Samajh party, Bhim Sena - Now they **do not want to be used as vote banks** but are emerging fwd themselves by formings PPs
            -   #### Demand of exclusive reservation (as they‚Äôre feeling crowded within SC category) - eg: **Vanniyar** community of TN
            -   More issues of dalit discrimination and untouchability have become the agenda of mainstream politics
            -   **10 year mission** of reservation has become a **political tool** (**Article 334**)
            -   Christophe Jefforlet ‚Äú Indians do not cast their Vote , they Vote their Caste‚Äù
            -   **Indian tendency** - Daughters and Votes must not go out one‚Äôs caste
            -   Dalit politics- recent Bhim Army in UP (edu schools for teaching Dalit history to child-both positive and negative benefits)
            -   **Castes based pressure groups** have emerged; **Policy making of govt** is still impacted by caste (reservation, Mandal commission)
        -   Economic:
            -   **Economic Association** based on castes - Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (**DICCI**), National SC Finance & Development Corporation (**NSCFDC**)
            -   **Dalit capitalism** (coined by Chandra Bhan Prasad which means capitalism being used for their emancipation) - fueled by association, **MUDRA** schemes, **Standup India** schemes, etc.
            -   **Confinement to informal sector after urbanisation** has led to **replication of** inequality based on **caste** in rural areas to based **on class** in urban areas
        -   Media
            -   **Media reports** an **accident also with religious or caste identities**, when it is **completely unnecessary**, say, a dalit youth killed in car accident
            -   Use of social media- **dalit centric films** and videos of continued discrimination like Hathras - shows equality still not there- assertion of identity
            -   Movies- Article 15
        -   Psychological
            -   **Like themselves being called Dalit** instead of Scheduled caste- **getting proud** of their **identity** which has **born of struggle and assertion** (just like African Americans in the United States moved away from the use of the term Negro)
    -   Way Forward:
        -   **Intermarriages** to reduce caste issues (fusion of blood), **Dereservation of castes based on social mapping**, **Education system** need to overhauled; Expedite the report of **Rohini Commission (37% caste zero rep, 97% edu/job by 25% caste);** Bring **Creamy Layer for SC as per Jarnail Singh Case 2018**
        -   #### Politics: Voter education, Sensitize PPs, Constitutional ideals
    -   Measures needed/taken
        -   NITI Aayog has proposed to revamp SC ST Sub Plan where rather than every ministry utilising funds for SC ST they will deposit it into a central fund; (this is done as at ministry level these funds were unutilized due to ministry not being able to identify schemes targeted to SC/ST)
        -   Fund allocation for schemes of SCs increase by >50% in Budget 2021-22

    -   2018: ‚ÄúCaste system is assuming new identities and associational forms. Hence, caste system cannot be eradicated in India.‚Äù Comment.
        -   Breif info about caste system and its basic features
        -   New forms and identities, association forms which is strenghtening caste identity- anhilation difficult
        -   However - casteless society ultimate aim for giving life of dignity to all- need awareness, debates on reservations, eco growth, preventing violence against dalit and untouchability - focus on rural areas etc
    -   2015: Debate the issue whether and how contemporary movements for assertion of Dalit identity work towards annihilation of caste. [Debate: Dailt identity movts. v/s annihilation of caste]
        -   Write positive effects of contemporary movt working for caste discrimination- more rep in govt, youth politics, confident about their identity etc, hathras and rohit vemula media coverage etc
        -   however diff - earlier anhilation- means removing caste- now feeling proud about it as seen in demands by other castes
        -   WF- Dr. BR Ambedkar in his **book ‚ÄòAnnihilation of Caste‚Äô** advocated for intermarriages to reduce caste issues (fusion of blood), sensitising children, reforming reservation system so that deserving should not get disheartned whatever be the caste, Dereservation of castes based on social mapping, Perception mgmt where job seekers need to made job creators, Education system need to overhauled (value based w/o any ideological coloration), Newer yardsticks to measures backwardness need to be introduced eg: NALSA judgement 2014 said OBC status to transgenders
    -   2020: Has caste lost its relevance in understanding the multi-cultural Indian Society? Elaborate your answer with illustrations
        -   Define multicultural society - a **society where many different cultures live together;** aka cultural diversity; In multicultural communities, **people retain, pass down, celebrate, and share their unique cultural** ways of life, languages, art, traditions, and behaviors
        -   **Ways in which caste is taking backseat** in urbanisation, sanskritisation, industrialisation, Role of state, Modernisation, Westernisation, new social media & movies, etc
        -   However **side by side assertion** also going on as well continued discrimination and violence so caste not lost relevance (write other PESTEL points wrt strengthening of caste)

-   2021: Q10. Examine the role of ‚ÄòGig Economy‚Äô in the process of empowerment of women in India. (Answer in 150 words) 10
    -   1. A **gig economy** is a **free market system** in which **temporary positions** are common and organizations hire **independent workers** for **short-term commitments.**
    -   1. Gig economy can help in **process of empowerment of women** in India in following ways:
        1. Gig employment allows **part-time work** and **flexible working hours** which allows women to **balance**their **traditional roles** (homemakers and care giver) with employment.
        2. Gig employment complemented by work-from-home (WFH) and technology has addressed the issue of safety during travel and night shifts. Also, new employment opportunities for women in tier 2 and 3 cities have emerged.
        3. It provides women with on-demand work allowing her join and drop-out of work force as per her own will.
        4. Gig employment helps women earn extra income, boosted her confidence and gives decision making power all of which are important component of women empowerment.
    -   2. However, gig economy comes with its own set of constraints such as:
        1. Gig economy works purely on market principle of demand and supply. It views humans just as another resource. Easily replaceable low skill gig laborers are exploited by employers. There is also lack of certainty regarding availability of work and stability of career.
        2. Lack of benefits: Flexi-workers usually are not entitled to minimum wages, insurances, PF, retirement plans, paid leave, maternity benefits, etc.
        3. Pay difference: Permanent employees have a grade-pay plus benefits like travel allowance, etc. Gig workers are paid strictly as per the amount of work.
        4. Restricted growth: Low skill gig workers cannot move-up the organizational hierarchy and not considered for promotions.
    -   3. In short term, gig economy can be a step towards increasing female labour force participation and women empowerment. But, in long run, predictable and formal employment with opportunities of upskilling is required

-   2014: Why do some of the most prosperous regions of India have an adverse sex ratio for women? Give your arguments
    -   1. India‚Äôs **per capita income increased nearly 10 times** over the last 65 years yet there has been an **unabated fall in child sex ratio since 1951**. This can also be corroborated by the fact that many Indian cities has high economic growth but lower figures on sex ratio than rural areas.
    2. Reasons: Continuation of Gender Bias (anti-female bias, suffer educational, health and nutritional discrimination); Son-Preference (men are perceived as the principal wage earners); Social Practices (Despite banning, dowry still prevalent and massive expense); Accessibility to postnatal sex selection techniques; Distortion in the Marriage System (some villages in Haryana and Punjab have such poor sex ratios that men ‚Äúimport‚Äù brides from other States which is often accompanied by the exploitation and violence, human trafficking)
        1. Gender-imbalance: Prof. Amartya Kumar Sen, in his world famous article ‚ÄúMissing Women? has statistically proved that during the last century, 100 million women have been missing in south Asia.
    3. Measures needed: Bringing Behavioural Change (government‚Äôs Beti-Bachao Beti Padhao Campaign has achieved remarkable success); Sensitizing Youth; Stringent Enforcement of Law (Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994)
