# Personal insights and Improvement Journaling
## Saturation
- its alright to change subject when saturated. do this: when saturated from short term target, make sure you have monthly goal in mind, and adjust accordingly. the diversity is so much that you wont feel saturated. at least for a year. thus,
	- weekly and daily targets = dynamically adjustable
	- monthly target = achieve at any cost.

## Lectures 
- What i feel when i listen to word "Lectures"
	- Illusion of conceptual clarity 
	- productive procrastination 
	- mental masturbation
- WHY?
	- the modern history lectures i watched, the polity lectures i watched **twice** what is the output? did they save my time? did they help me write good answer?
	- it sure felt productive and felt like i ma getting things done but was it the case fr? 
	- ULTIMATELY toh bhai notes revise karunga tab firse kuch kuch confusions hongi, lectures waste of time :(
	- the point it, even after i watched those lectures, made notes dilligently, i wont use it anywhere. the output is minimal. 
- Goal is not to watch lectures and do what everybody else does, the conventional path of UPSC aspirant, BUT- just a simple goal = CLEAR THE EXAM. by hook or crook.

## Updated strategy and mindset.
#### Prelims: 
1. **Copy paste AIR 28 Notes** (why AIR 28?: Vision IAS + Value added = complete in a good format)
2. Read them on split screen on my **iPad like teaching myself**- Twice. = *refer to lectures ONLY when any topic is NOT understandable*. (got em all complete lectures on YouTube thankfully already.)
3. read standard book alongside these base notes as a reference. - skim fast topics repeated and understood. 
4. **Remember**: *Dont Focus on remembering stuff*. for that **anki decks of rahul w already exist**. 
> [!Workflow:]
>1. Topic wise notes(AIR28) to [[Lecture Notes]] 
>2. Read like teaching myself 
>3. Standard book parallel to it. 
>4. Read once --> solve mocks and PYQs
>5. Read second twice with focus on weak areas. 
>DONE!

#### Mains (workflow not set on stone but in general:)
1. Copy paste AIR 28 Notes / Rahul W notes --> Read it once and some topper copies alongside. 
2. Mains advance batch = Vision *Lectures* (**Why?= Mains ke lectures analytical thinking ke liye yaad rahenge and will selve the purpose of foundation and FOMO**) ADD TO BASE
3. Read topper copies for a particular topic --> Practice that topic --> Value addition after practice. --> for whats lacking/needed. 

#### Socio
- Bhai procrastinate mat kar! Lectures dekh chuka hai, repeat karke fayeda nahi. badhiya transcript hai. jaldi jaldi khatm kar. JO samajh me nai aaye uske liye lecture dekhlena. 
##### Paper 1:
1. Read transcript Notes --> get foundational understanding. 
2. Make topic wise notes Like GS. add links to syllabus MOC. (use content from these lectures primarily and other content various pdfs out there.)
3. PRACTICE. AFTER EVERY TOPIC COMPLETION. 
##### Paper 2: 
1. Lecture transcripts. on ipad. 
2. Topic wise notes.
3. Extra: Smriti mam class notes/ Lectures.
4. PRACTICE. AFTER EVERY TOPIC COMPLETION. 

##### Extra: 
- Level up crashcourse : content add karlena --> READY NOTES me. 
- jo cheeze yaad nahi ho usko anki me daaldena.
- jo cheeze nahi samajh aaye uske liye lecture dekhlena ya ignou padhlena ya next ias notes ya AI.
