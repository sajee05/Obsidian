# Marxist and Feminist Views of Family

## Quick Recap of Previous Material (17:20)

- **Family Definition (MURDOCH)**: A social group which is characterized by common residence, economic cooperation and reproduction
- **Key Components**: It includes adults of both sexes, at least two of whom are in a socially approved sexual relationship, and one or more children (biological or adopted) socially recognized as their children

### Functional Theory of Family

- **Four Functions according to PARSONS**: Reproductive, educational, economic and sexual functions
- **Two Basic Functions in Industrial Modern Society**:
  1. Primary socialization of young
  2. Stabilization of adult personalities
- These are the two basic and irreducible functions of the nuclear family in modern industrial society

### Critical Views of Family Previously Discussed

- **Unresolved parental conflict**: Projected onto children leading to emotional scapegoating and mental instability
- **EDMUND LEECH**: Nuclear family criticism
- **RD LANG**: Compares families to gangsters due to nexus between family members
- **DAVID COOPER**: Interiorization of the family kills the individual, death of family necessary for liberation of individual from its clutches

## Marxist View of the Family (24:27)

- **KARL MARX**: Wrote very little on family himself
- **ENGELS**: Wrote detailed commentary in his book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State"

### ENGELS' Analysis of Family Evolution

#### Primitive Society Stage

- **No restrictions on sexual behavior**: Any member of group could have sex with any other person without social/legal restrictions
- **Pre-private property era**: No concept of inheritance or property transmission

#### Emergence of Private Property and Family

- **Technological improvement**: Led to surplus and emergence of private property concept
- **Need for paternity certainty**: People required mechanism to be sure of paternity of children who would be heirs to their property
- **Sexual behavior restrictions**: Increasingly put in place to ensure undisputed paternity
- **Monogamous marriage system**: Culminated in one man-one woman system so men could be sure of property transmission

#### Formalization Process

- **State intervention**: These restrictions on sexual behavior were sanctified and formalized by the state through laws
- **Purpose**: This was done to ensure that property was passed down to children of undisputed paternity

## Marxist Feminist Perspective (34:11)

- **Mid-20th century development**: Marxist framework applied by feminist scholars to analyze working-class family in modern industrial capitalist society
- **MARXIST FEMINISTS**: Those who apply Marxist framework to comment on position of women in society and family

### Family as Part of Superstructure

- **Superstructure role**: Family legitimizes status quo and protects/serves class interests of capitalists (bourgeoisie)
- **Serves ruling class**: Working-class family serves interests of those presently in power in capitalist society

### Ways Family Serves Capitalist Interests

#### 1. Reproduction of Labor Power (37:56)

- **Continuous supply**: Capitalist system requires uninterrupted supply of labor power
- **Working-class families**: Ensure continuous supply through reproduction
- **Scholar**: ANGELA DAVIS has written extensively on this issue

#### 2. Ideological Conditioning Device (39:06)

- **Submission to authority**: Family teaches traits useful for capitalist system
- **Blind obedience**: Following authority figures, doing as told
- **Authority training**: "Yes papa" becomes "yes boss" in workplace
- **Non-questioning attitude**: Personalities well-suited for exploitative capitalist system
- **Scholars**: DIANE FEE and DAVID COOPER have highlighted this dimension

#### 3. Reduces Bargaining Power of Proletariat (43:29)

- **MARGARET BENSTON**: Highlighted this dimension
- **Social responsibility burden**: Working-class man burdened with moral responsibility of providing for wife and children
- **Cannot withdraw labor**: Compelled to sell labor for whatever meager wages offered by capitalist
- **Reduced negotiating power**: Family responsibilities prevent withdrawal from labor market

#### 4. Unpaid Domestic Labor (46:35)

- **MARGARET BENSTON**: One wage buys labor of two persons for capitalist
- **Women's unpaid work**: Working-class women perform very large amounts of unpaid labor inside homes
- **Capitalist benefit**: Male worker free to devote all hours for producing surplus for capitalist
- **Zero cost**: Wife's domestic labor at zero cost to capitalist

#### 5. Safe Venting of Frustration (50:00)

- **Exploitation effects**: Workers' frustration and anger from capitalist exploitation
- **FRAN ANSLEY**: Men enjoy "petty dictatorship" over their wives and children
- **Anger redirection**: Frustration safely channelized within family realm rather than against capitalist system
- **"Takers of shit"**: Women perform traditional role, helping capitalist bosses sleep more secure ⭐ (This is a direct quote from Fran Ansley but uses offensive language that may be inappropriate in academic contexts)

## Liberal Feminist Views of Family (54:16)

### Overview of Feminist Categories

- **Three main categories**:
  1. **Marxist feminism**: See economic factors as basis of women's exploitation
  2. **Liberal feminism**: Suggest incremental changes within existing social framework
  3. **Radical feminism**: Suggest complete overhaul of prevailing social structures

### ANN OAKLEY's Analysis (56:55)

#### Gender Socialization

- **Family role**: Engages in gender socialization, teaches and reinforces gender stereotypes
- **Personality traits**: Family encourages traits that align with traditional gender roles
- **Birth vs. socialization**: "You are born a female and made into a woman"
- **Sex vs. gender distinction**: Male/female are sex categories (anatomy-based), man/woman are learned personality traits

#### Gender-Specific Upbringing

- **Boys raised to be**: Dominating, aggressive
- **Girls raised to be**: Delicate, weak
- **Toy examples**: Girls get dolls/kitchen sets, boys get guns/cars (markers of aggression/assertion)
- **Role preparation**: Family prepares both genders for future gender-specific roles in society
- **Subconscious learning**: Through observing parents' examples and division of labor

#### Mother-Housewife Role Critique (63:38)

- **Primary social identity**: Adult women's defining identity is mother and housewife
- **Most alienating role**: One of most alienating of all social activities
- **Working conditions**:
  - Very long hours with no cap (unlike factory workers)
  - Never any holidays
  - Unpaid and not regarded as work
  - Deemed as "non-work" by society
- **Work characteristics**: Dull, monotonous, repetitive, no scope for innovation or enriching experience
- **Public health concern**: Should be regarded as public health concern number one due to widespread effects ⭐ (This seems like a strong claim that may need verification)

### JESSE BERNARD's Marriage Analysis (70:17)

#### Two Marriages Concept

- **Every marriage contains**: Actually two marriages - man's marriage and woman's marriage
- **Different experiences**: The two are quite different from each other

#### Research Findings

- **Married men**: Live longer, healthier, more fulfilling lives than unmarried men
- **Married women**: More prone to disease, sickness, generally more dissatisfied and unhappier than unmarried women
- **Net result**: Men are net beneficiaries of marriage, women are net losers

## Radical Feminist Views (74:09)

### Key Scholars

- **SUSAN BROWN MILLER, CAROL HANISH, SHULAMIT FIRESTONE**: Major radical feminist scholars

### Criticisms of Family

1. **Patriarchal ideology**: Family socializes young into patriarchal ideology
2. **Childbearing burden**: Women alone bear burden of childbearing and child rearing
3. **Seat of patriarchal power**: Family is seat of patriarchal power - patriarchal unit of patriarchal whole
4. **Naked patriarchal expression**: Within family, patriarchal attitudes and actions visible in most naked form

### Domestic Violence Analysis

- **Widespread problem**: Domestic abuse is rampant across all social classes
- **Not class-specific**: Occurs in educated, middle, and upper-middle class homes
- **Examples cited**: PRITI ZINTA, RISHI KAPOOR's wife cases mentioned ⭐ (These appear to be specific allegations that may need verification)
- **Global statistics**: According to United Nations, every third woman has experienced spousal violence across globe
- **Indian data**: National Family Health Survey 5 found about 30% of female respondents experienced spousal violence

### ANTHONY GIDDENS' Transformation of Intimacy (92:01)

#### Historical Evolution of Marriage Basis

| Era                       | Basis of Marriage        | Characteristics                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-industrial Society    | Pragmatic considerations | Practical needs - cooking, provision, safety, sex, reproduction |
| Modern Industrial Society | Romantic love            | Concept of soulmate, perfect man/woman imagery                  |
| Contemporary Period       | Plastic sexuality        | Flexibility, choice, multiple partners                          |

#### Romantic Love Characteristics

- **Soulmate concept**: Every person has predetermined soulmate to find
- **Perfect imagery**: Built on imagery of perfect man (tall, dark, handsome) and perfect woman (beautiful, virgin, delicate)
- **Popularization**: Through literature, romantic novels, films (SHAH RUKH KHAN in Indian context)
- **Survey data**: More than 80% Americans identify love as important reason for marriage

#### Plastic Sexuality Era

- **Moldable/flexible**: Like plastic - inherent flexibility in sexual relationships
- **Multiple partners**: People have multiple sexual partners
- **Duration flexibility**: Relationships last only as long as both parties benefit
- **Contraceptive impact**: Development of contraceptive technology separated sexual act from reproduction
- **Sexual freedom**: Can have sex without worrying about pregnancy and long-term commitments
- **Arrangements**: Short-term arrangements like open relationships, one-night stands, friends with benefits

#### Pure Love

- **Contemporary development**: Plastic sexuality era witnessed rise of "pure love"
- **Shift pattern**: From pragmatic considerations → romantic love → plastic sexuality and pure love

### Late Marriages Trend (107:48)

- **US Census Bureau data (2018)**: Average age of first marriage increased to 30 years for men, 28 years for women

#### Consequences of Late Marriages

1. **Decline in fertility rate**: Later marriage = fewer children due to biological window
2. **Premarital sex normalization**: Becomes commonplace and acceptable
3. **Dating institutionalization**: Society develops mechanisms for sexual need satisfaction before marriage
4. **Earlier sexual intercourse**: Age of first sexual intercourse declined to 16-18 years in US

### Living Relationships/Unmarried Cohabitation (120:43)

- **Definition**: Young adults staying together without formal marriage
- **US Statistics (2016)**: About 7% of America's adult population in living relationships
- **Indian context**: Becoming more common but often hidden from families

#### Social Consequences

- Traditional sanctity of marriage declines
- More childbirths outside marriage
- Need for legal framework expansion (domestic violence laws covering living partners)

### Single Person Households (125:48)

- **US trend**: Increased from 12% in 1961 to 29% in 2010

#### Social Ramifications

1. **Fertility rate decline**: Single people don't reproduce
2. **More mobile labor force**: Easier job relocation without family considerations
3. **Greater spending flexibility**: More impulse purchases, self-spending
4. **Reduced average household size**: Fewer people per household
5. **Boost to personal care industry**: Need for nurses, medical services when sick

### Changes in Reproductive Behavior (130:59)

1. **Decline in fertility rate**: Leading to declining population size and smaller family size
2. **Increased age of first child**: People having children later
3. **Increasing childlessness**: 15% of American women aged 40-44 have never birthed children
4. **Technology in reproduction**: Contraceptives, cesarean births, IVF, surrogacy

### Births Outside Marriage (138:14)

- **US Statistics**: About 40% of all births by unmarried mothers
- **Legitimacy concept**: Traditional notion of legitimate/illegitimate children being transformed

### Elderly Living Arrangements (140:45)

- **Historical pattern**: Elderly moved in with adult children after spouse's death
- **Current trend**: Elderly staying alone even after widowhood
- **Statistics**: Only 12% widows above 65 lived alone in 1910 vs. 70% nowadays

#### Reasons for Change

- Better health than elderly in past
- Greater financial independence
- Expanded state welfare support
- Reduced dependence on children

### Changing Family Relationships (144:57)

#### Spousal Relationship Changes

- **Reduced women's dependence**: Women pursuing independent careers
- **Symmetrical family emergence**: More equality in roles and powers of husband and wife
- **Scholars**: YOUNG and WILMET wrote about this
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Women gainfully employed outside home
  - Men contributing to domestic chores
  - Women's views sought in family decisions
  - Greater independence and say for women

#### Parent-Child Relationship Changes (148:58)

- **More democratized**: Less rigidly hierarchical and authoritarian
- **Collaborative decision-making**: Family decisions made through conversation and consultation
- **Two-way communication**: Rather than authoritative, rigid approach

### Divorce Rate Analysis (152:52)

- **Western rates**: 30-50% in different western societies
- **Indian rates**: Very low, less than 3-5% of all marriages
- **Comparison**: Every second or third marriage in west ends in divorce vs. very rare in India

#### Reasons for High Western Divorce Rates

1. **Reduced social stigma**: Divorce more socially acceptable
2. **Women's financial independence**: Can afford to leave marriage
3. **Excessive expectations** (LEECH): Nuclear family like overloaded electrical circuit
4. **Decline in religious significance**: Marriage secularized rather than sacred
5. **Legal framework changes**: Divorce made quicker and easier

#### Social Implications of High Divorce

1. **More single-parent households**: Children stay with one parent
2. **Rise in step families**: 50% US children below 13 live in step families ⭐ (This statistic seems very high and may need verification)
3. **Different relationship dynamics**: Greater chance of sexual abuse, different sibling relationships

#### PARSONS' Interpretation

- **High divorce rate indicates**: Very high value American society places on marriage and family
- **Logic**: Societies with low divorce rates don't expect much from marriage and compromise in bad marriages
- **Americans expect more**: High expectations lead to leaving unsatisfactory marriages
- **High remarriage rates**: 20% of US marriages were remarriage for one spouse, another 20% remarriage for both spouses
