# Environmental Sociology and Climate Change

## Introduction to Environmental Sociology (30:21)

- The discussion begins with a question about whether environmental concerns should be part of sociology, given that this is not a geography class or GS environment portion
- **Environment as part of society**: Environment cannot be separated from society as life cannot function without environment
- **Nature's definition**: Refers to flora, fauna, forests, and natural elements that affect human life

### Environmental Impact on Society

- **Religious practices**: Many religious practices are derived from or related to environment
  - Examples from Indian society: Sun worship, Indra Deva worship
- **Economic activities**: Based on raw materials obtained from nature supplied by mother nature
- **Way of life influenced by environment**: All parameters of life are affected including habits, dressing, and food habits
  - People in hot climates wear cotton clothes
  - Kashmiri people wear warm woolen clothes
  - Rajasthani tribes like Kalbeliya tribe copy snake movements in their dance forms (Naggin dance)

### Contemporary Environmental Challenges

- **Development vs Environment conflict**: Development is being compromised because of environmental concerns, and environment is compromised because of development
- **Human-animal conflict**: Results from this development-environment tension
- **Administrative and judicial frameworks**: NGT (National Green Tribunal) and other tribunals exist for environmental protection
- **Policy considerations**: Today's policy must be informed by environmental concern
- **Tribal dependence**: A considerable chunk of population, particularly tribals, are directly dependent upon environment for their survival
- **Moral duty**: It is our moral and social duty to ensure coexistence of wildlife and humanity as the superior species

## Environmental Impact on Social Life (32:03)

### Resource Scarcity and Social Conflict

- **Basic survival needs**: Shortage of natural resources like water leads to social conflict and tensions
- **Interstate disputes**: Resource scarcity causes conflicts between states
- **Slums and industry disputes**: Environmental degradation affects urban areas
- **Higher needs**: Even spiritual and religious needs are affected (Hindus retiring to forests for spiritual awakening)
- **Religion and nature**: Religion started as nature worship

### Climate Change Reality

- **Current trends**: Every year is becoming the hottest year since records began
- **Environmental destruction**: Results in flash floods and numerous other problems
- **COP 28**: International climate conferences highlight global concerns
- **Physical manifestations**:
  - Glaciers melting
  - Coastal area problems
  - Heat bubbles in urban areas
  - Heat waves
  - Erratic rainfall patterns
  - Unpredictable monsoons

## Founding Fathers and Environmental Concerns (43:35)

### Neglect in Classical Sociology

- **Founding fathers' oversight**: Most writings of founding fathers (Marx, Weber, Durkheim) do not contain adequate analysis of environmental concerns
- **Absence of environmental analysis**: How environment affects human society and impact of human activity on environment was largely neglected
- **Exception - Marx**: Only fleeting mention of rising pollution in urban areas from industrial zones and factories, making cities unlivable
- **Conspicuous absence**: Environmental concerns are conspicuous by their absence in founding fathers' writings

### Development of Environmental Sociology

- **Timeline**: Environmental sociology as a field started developing around the middle of the 20th century (mid-20th century)
- **Contemporary recognition**: Today it is well acknowledged that human societies are embedded in a wider ecology
- **Mutual impact**: Human activities have profound impact on environment, and human social life is greatly affected by environment
- **Holistic understanding**: Everything from religious beliefs to economic activity to policy is affected by environment

## 21st Century as Environmental Century (49:07)

### Ernst Weiszacker's Observation

- **Key statement**: Ernst Weiszacker says the 21st century is the century of the environment
- **Meaning**: Environmental concerns and developments will affect each and every aspect of social life

### Environmental Impact on Social Institutions

- **Law**: Plethora of legislation regulating man-nature interaction including Wildlife Protection Act, Forest Conservation Act
- **Public administration**: Ministry of Environment and Forests, National Green Tribunal
- **International relations**: Conflicts between developed and developing countries regarding burden sharing of environmental conservation and carbon emissions
- **Migration patterns**: Environmental factors affect population movement
- **Politics**: Environmental concerns influence political decisions
- **Urban planning**: Cities planned with environmental considerations
- **Healthcare**: Corona regarded as zoonotic disease having animal origins
- **Transportation**: Shift to CNG as cleaner fuel
- **Religion**: Hindu Diwali crackers affected due to environmental concerns

## Anthony Giddens on Modern Capitalism (52:42)

- **Giddens' analysis**: Modern capitalism and industrialism adversely affects nature
- **Consequences**: Results in large scale environmental degradation and ecological destruction
- **IPCC reports**: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports point out that global warming has been caused due to ecological degradation
- **Anthropogenic factors**: Human activities causing temperature rise globally including:
  - Cutting of trees
  - Burning of fossil fuels
  - Livestock farming
  - Use of nitrogenous fertilizers
  - Greenhouse gas emissions

## Climate Change and Human Health (55:52)

### A.J. McMichael's Analysis

- **Health impacts**: Climate change adversely affects human health leading to new diseases and extreme weather patterns
- **Natural disasters**: Leading to injuries and deaths
- **Vulnerable populations**: Climate change will particularly affect poorer regions and populations

### Environmental Justice

- **Rich vs Poor debate**: Whether environmental concerns are a rich man's concern or developed country's concern
- **Full tummy phenomena**: Once adequate material security is achieved, focus shifts to environmental quality
- **Reality for poor**: Poorer populations and countries will be affected more by climate change
- **Impacts on poor**: Heat waves, floods, cyclones, disturbed water flows, forced migration, food security issues, mental health problems

## Sustainable Development (60:39)

### Definition and Concept

- **Classic definition**: From Brundtland Report - "Development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"
- **Implicit criticism**: The concept contains implicit criticism of the present model of development
- **Unsustainability**: Present developmental model being pursued is largely unsustainable

### Why Current Model is Unsustainable

- **Rapid resource depletion**: Natural resources are used at a faster pace
- **Wasteful usage**: Inefficient usage of resources
- **Characteristics of current model**:
  - Based on large scale industrialization
  - Mass production
  - Fuel guzzling
  - Resource intensive
  - Wasteful
  - Ecologically unviable
- **False assumption**: Assumes natural resources are limitless, which they are not

## Three Pillars of Sustainable Development (89:04)

### Balanced Approach

- **Three pillars**: Economic, Social, and Ecological
- **Integration requirement**: Sustainable development lies at intersection of all three concerns
- **No sacrifice approach**: Don't sacrifice economic growth for environment
- **Balance principle**: Strike balance between all three aspects rather than seeing them in conflict

## Requirements for Sustainable Development (91:53)

### Technological Changes

- **New technologies needed**: Present production and manufacturing technologies based on industrial revolution model
- **Current problems**: Resource guzzling and environmentally destructive

- **Political will**: Immense political will required
- **Short-term vs long-term**: Economy benefits in long run but may face short-term dips
- **Political consensus**: Required across party lines on need for sustainable development

### Policy Framework

- **Enabling policies**: Required at international, national, state, and local levels
- **International negotiations**: Between countries on environmental issues
- **Developed vs developing countries stance**:
  - **Developed countries**: Accusing big developing economies (India, China) of being biggest polluters
  - **Developing countries**: Insisting on "polluter must pay" principle
- **Climate justice**: Shared but differentiated responsibility
- **International agreements**: Net zero carbon emissions by 2050, carbon trading systems

### Private Sector Involvement

- **Cost considerations**: Private sector faces costs for implementing green technologies
- **Government role**: Stringent implementation of environmental protection laws
- **Incentive mechanisms**: Tax holidays, subsidies (example: solar panel subsidies)

### Attitudinal Change

- **Individual responsibility**: People think one individual cannot make a difference

- **Multi-level change**: Required at individual, government, and private sector levels

### People's Participation

- **Civil society role**: Essential for sustainable development
- **Awareness creation**: Through education and campaigns
- **Government initiatives**: Mission Life (Lifestyle for Environment)
  - Solar panels on residences
  - Shift from ceramic cups to earthen pots
  - Jute bags instead of plastic
  - Avoiding synthetic materials
- **People's movement**: Sustainable development should become a people's movement

## Ecological Conflicts and Movements (121:51)

### Definition and Characteristics

- **Ecological conflicts**: Conflicts between social groups for control over natural resources including water, land, forest produce, timber, minerals, marine resources
- **India's ranking**: According to Environmental Justice Atlas, India tops the list with over 300 ecological conflicts
- **Types of conflicts**: Over ownership, control, exploitation of natural resources

### Historical Context

- **Ramachandra Guha and Madhav Gadgil**: In book "Ecology and Equity"
- **1950s-60s period**: Not many environmental movements or conflicts during first two decades after independence
- **Reasons for initial calm**:
  - National leadership gave clarion call for collective resource utilization for national development
  - People had abiding faith in national leadership (Chacha Nehru's influence)
  - Trust in Nehruvian state

### Rise of Conflicts (1970s onwards)

- **Change by 1970s**: Large number of protests and agitations started in different parts of country
- **Reason for change**: People realized benefits of developmental projects were not accruing to them but being diverted elsewhere
- **Trend since 1970s**: Ecological conflicts have increased in both frequency and intensity

### Factors Contributing to Increased Conflicts

- **Population increase**: Increasing competition between social groups for finite natural resources
- **Industrialization**: Resources getting depleted at faster pace
- **Multinational corporations**: Set eyes on natural resources
- **Increasing awareness**: People more aware of their rights

## Forest-Based Struggles (133:39)

### Historical Background

- **Colonial period**: Forest department established, forest laws passed, dikus introduced in tribal areas
- **Result**: Numerous tribal revolts and uprisings with forest resource control as important ingredient

### Chipko Movement

- **Access issues**: Water bodies and fish access has been matter of contention in coastal states
- **States affected**: Tamil Nadu, Kerala facing fishermen community protests

### Mechanized Trawlers Conflict

- **Traditional vs mechanized**: Local fisherman communities protested against mechanized trawlers
- **Problems caused by trawlers**:
  - Catch fish in large amounts
  - Disturb fish breeding patterns (requires calmer waters)
  - Reduce fish available for traditional fishing
  - Make traditional fishing unsustainable

### Recent Water Conflicts

- **Coca-Cola plants**: Opposed in Kerala for water pollution

## Dam Projects - "Dams and the Damned" (150:26)

### Nehru's Vision

- **Nehru's belief**: "Big dams and factories will be the temples of modern India"
- **Expected benefits**:
  - Cheap electricity (renewable, pollution-free)
  - Irrigation facility
  - Flood control
  - Promote pisciculture (fish breeding)

### Ignored Costs

- **State's oversight**: In enthusiasm to build large scale projects, state ignored social and ecological costs

### Ecological Costs of Dam Building

- **Forest submergence**: Entire forests submerged
- **Aquatic life disturbance**: Water ecosystems disrupted
- **Water logging**: Led to new diseases
- **Ecological balance**: Adversely affected forest ecological balance

### Social Costs

- **Large scale displacement**: Massive population displacement
