# Rural Sociology: Green Revolution and Agrarian Structure

## Rural Sociology Recap (13:31)

- **Colonial view of Indian villages**: Villages were considered as "little republics" - a phrase used by **CHARLES METCALF**
- **Village studies boom**: Village studies became popular in the **1950s** due to India becoming a welfare state with greater engagement of the state with the population, as most population resided in villages
- **Critical perspectives**: **AMBEDKAR** had a critical view of rural society, though he was not entirely hopeless about rural life
- **Land reforms**: The last topic discussed before this lecture, focusing on their impact including the downfall of Congress and issues with women cultivators being ignored in land rights

## Green Revolution (18:00)

### Definition and Objectives

- **Green Revolution (Harit Kranti)**: A state-led program of technological modernization of Indian agriculture
- **Main objective**: To significantly increase agricultural production and productivity to attain self-sufficiency in food grain production

### Key Features and Technologies

- **Technologies introduced**:
  
  - HYV (High Yielding Varieties) seeds
  - Insecticides and pesticides
  - Chemical fertilizers
  - Irrigation facilities
  - Tractors and threshers
  - Dams and credit facilities

- **Context of implementation**: 
  
  - Widespread mass hunger globally
  - India's dependence on imported substandard food grain from the US (PL480)
  - National security concerns due to food dependence

### Key Contributors

- **NORMAN BORLAUG**: Western scientist who contributed significantly
- **SWAMINATHAN**: Indian scientist involved in the green revolution

### Positive Consequences

**ASHOK GULATI** points out several positive impacts:

1. **Increase in rural prosperity**
2. **Expanded market for agro-industry products**
3. **Boost to consumer goods industries** (washing machines, mixers, etc.)
4. **Helped stem migration from rural areas to urban slums**

**K.N. RAJ** highlights:

- **Considerable stimulus to private investment in agriculture**
- **Improvements in transportation system**
- **Road building and transportation network development**
- **Rural electrification**
- **Agricultural research universities establishment**
- **Credit and banking network expansion in rural areas**

**DANDEKAR and RAJ** note:

- **Primary objective of self-sufficiency was met within reasonable time frame**
- **Helped tackle mass hunger, rural poverty and famines**
- **Encouraged saving habit in rural populace**
- **Infused sense of competition in Indian agriculture**
- **Gave boost to rural entrepreneurship**

### Negative Consequences

#### Economic Inequality

**FRANKLIN FRANKEL** points out:

- **Led to increase in income gap between big farmers and small farmers**
- **Big farmers could benefit more from mechanization** due to:
  - Capital intensive nature of green revolution
  - Economies of scale advantages
  - Better access to formal credit channels

#### Social Impact

**RUDOLPH and RUDOLPH** and **PAUL BRASS** note:

- **Intermediate castes like YADAVS and JATS of UP** who had benefited from land reforms were enthusiastic participants and able to modernize

**ASHISH BOSE** (leading demographer):

- **Led to increase in demand for male child**
- **Contributed to skewed child sex ratio**

#### Environmental Issues

**VANDANA SHIVA** in "The Violence of Green Revolution":

- **Environmentally destructive** compared to traditional ecologically sustainable farming methods
- **Reduction in crop diversity** with focus on wheat and rice at cost of other crops
- **Introduction of chemicals in food chain** due to excessive pesticides and fertilizers
- **Depleted soil of nutrients** leading to declined soil fertility
- **Adversely affected groundwater table**

#### Water Crisis

**SINGH** writes extensively about water dimension:

- **Acute water shortage in northwest India** (Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, parts of UP) was made worse
- **80% of water demand comes from agriculture**
- **Increased cropping intensity** with shorter cycles
- **Introduction of water intensive crops** like rice and sugarcane
- **Rapid depletion of groundwater table**

#### Labor Impact

**BILLINGS and SINGH** study:

- **Led to reduction in demand for labor by up to 50%** due to mechanization

**JAN BREMAN** concept:

- **Foot loose labor**: Continuously mobile workers searching for temporary livelihood sources
- **Seasonal rural to rural migration** from non-green belt areas (Bihar, Eastern UP) to green revolution areas (Punjab, Haryana, Western UP)
- **Foot loose labor more prone to exploitation** due to:
  - Complete dependence on labor contractors and landlords
  - Reduced bargaining power
  - Often paid less than minimum wage
  - Higher risk of accidents with mechanized agriculture

#### Regional and Social Issues

- **Regional imbalances**: Some regions became prosperous while others remained underdeveloped
- **Spawned regional movements** like Telangana movement due to coastal Andhra prosperity vs interior parts
- **Drug problem in Punjab** traced partly to green revolution
- **Cancer epidemic in Punjab** attributed partly to excessive chemical use

| Positive Impacts                | Negative Impacts             |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Self-sufficiency in food grains | Environmental degradation    |
| Rural prosperity increase       | Income inequality widening   |
| Infrastructure development      | Water crisis intensification |
| Technology advancement          | Labor displacement           |
| Entrepreneurship boost          | Regional imbalances          |
| Poverty reduction               | Social disruption            |

## Mode of Production in Indian Agriculture (50:23)

### Feudal Mode of Production

#### Key Characteristics

- **Main input**: Land obtained through inheritance passed down from generation to generation
- **Other inputs**: Seeds, water, manure procured from nature
- **Land significance**: Far beyond economic importance as primary input
  - Strong sentimental and emotional attachment
  - Marker of social status and family honor
  - Not readily sold regardless of price offered

#### Social Relations

- **Main classes**: Zamindars/Lords and Garibs/Tenants/Serfs
- **Hierarchical relationship**: Lords enjoy very high status, dignity, patronage, and immense power
- **Decision making**: Lords take all decisions regarding production process
- **Beyond economic ties**: Tenants provide customary services and extra help to lord families
- **Exploitative forms**: Sometimes included sexual exploitation of tenant women by lords

#### Production Purpose

- **Primary purpose**: To meet sustenance needs of tenant and lord families
- **Nature**: Primarily meant for consumption, not market sale

### Capitalist Mode of Production

#### Key Features

- **Main input**: Capital
- **Other inputs**: HYV seeds, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, irrigation, tractors, threshers, electricity
- **Input source**: All inputs procured from market, not nature

#### Production Purpose

- **Primary objective**: Sale in market for profit maximization
- **Nature**: Agriculture treated as business like any other, not way of life

#### Land Relations

- **Land status**: Considered as one input in production process
- **Marketable commodity**: Can be bought and sold in market
- **Sentimental attachment**: Greatly vanished or decreased
- **Acquisition**: Need not be inherited; can be bought or leased

#### Social Relations

- **Tenant obligations**: Confined to timely payment of rent
- **Decision making**: Taken by tenant/entrepreneur working the enterprise
- **Working class**: Growth of agricultural working class paid monetary wages
- **No customary ties**: No exploitation or customary services required

### Current State of Indian Agriculture

**DAI** and **K.L. SHARMA** consider:

- **Changing from feudal mode to capitalist mode** in several parts of country
- **Change taking place at rapid pace**
- **Feudal mode in purest form**: Confined to most underdeveloped regions such as Eastern UP and Bihar
- **Capitalist mode more pronounced**: In pockets of green revolution such as Punjab, Haryana and Western UP

#### Regional Studies

**ASHOK RUDRA** in study of Punjab:

- **Found capitalist mode quite pronounced**
- **Capitalist farmer tends to**:
  - Cultivate land himself instead of leasing out
  - Employ hired labor instead of family labor
  - Use machinery
  - Be market minded and profit oriented

**AMIT BHADURI** in study of West Bengal:

- **Considers agriculture in East India to be semi-feudal**
- **Characteristics**:
  - Extensive use of sharecropping arrangements
  - Land owners frequently lenders to small tenants
  - Small tenants lack full access to market
  - Often in perpetual indebtedness

**UTSA PATNAIK** considers:

- **Indian agriculture largely pre-capitalist** because:
  - Lack of capital accumulation
  - Personalized relations between landowners and landless laborers
  - Widespread informal money lending
- **Small but growing class of agricultural capitalists** exists

| Feudal Mode                   | Capitalist Mode                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Land through inheritance      | Land bought/leased from market |
| Inputs from nature            | Inputs from market             |
| For consumption               | For profit maximization        |
| Way of life                   | Business enterprise            |
| Hierarchical social relations | Market-based relations         |
| Customary obligations         | Monetary transactions only     |
| Lords make decisions          | Entrepreneur makes decisions   |
| Emotional attachment to land  | Land as commodity              |

## Community Development Program (90:12)

### Overview and Objectives

- **CDP**: Multi-purpose program launched in **1950s** with aim of overall development of rural India
- **Nehruvian faith**: Very abiding faith in power of bureaucracy to bring about desirable transformation
- **State-led approach**: State machinery and community involvement based rural development program

### Program Components

**CDP included**:

- Agriculture
- Animal husbandry
- Irrigation
- Cooperatives
- Public health
- Education
- Communication facilities
- Village industries

### Implementation Structure

- **Government officials assigned for each activity at district level** to plan, execute and evaluate program up to village level
- **Aimed at community involvement** by using local leadership, human and physical resources to transform agrarian economy

### Objectives According to S.C. DUBE

**Main aims**:

1. Increase agricultural production
2. Improve rural communication system
3. Better health and hygiene
4. Education

**Overall goal**: Complete socioeconomic transformation of villages

### Reasons for Failure

**DUBE** suggests CDP unable to achieve objectives due to:

- **Excessive bureaucratization**
- **Absence of clear priorities**
- **Hierarchical caste relations in village**
- **Unqualified personnel** without requisite skills and training
- **Top down approach**

**ARAM** considers:

- **CDP erroneously assumed village community has consensus and common interests**
- **Failed to take into account villages have irreconcilable differences**

**OSCAR LEWIS**:

- **Lot of confusion and conflict regarding powers and duties of officials**

### Recommendations

**BALWANT RAI MEHTA COMMITTEE**:

- **Suggested democratic decentralization for success of program**

## Cooperatives (102:55)

### Definition and Principles

- **Cooperative**: Collectivity of people who pool their resources and jointly undertake and manage some economic activity in cooperation
- **Autonomous association** in which people unite voluntarily to fulfill common economic and social needs
- **Democratically controlled** by their members

### Historical Development

- **Origin**: In agriculture and allied sectors at end of 19th century
- **Context**: Growing indebtedness and impoverishment of farmers
- **First establishment**: Cooperative societies were first established to address agrarian distress

### Successful Examples in India

**Major successful cooperatives**:

- **Sugar cooperatives in Maharashtra**
- **Milk cooperatives in Gujarat**
- **Silk cooperatives in Kerala** 
- **Fishing cooperatives in Kerala**
- **Wide network of banking and credit institutions**

### Legal Recognition

- **97th Constitutional Amendment**: Recognized importance of cooperatives making it fundamental right
- **2021**: Central government established new **Ministry of Cooperation** to strengthen cooperative movement

### Scholarly Perspectives

**DUBASHI**:

- **Cooperatives are not just association but are a movement**

**ARAM**:

- **Helped address agrarian distress to some extent**
- **Complement land reforms**

**DANIEL THORNER**:

- **Most cooperatives have been hijacked by rich and powerful**
- **Many cooperatives dominated by single family** in villages of Gujarat

**BAVISKAR and ATTWOOD** in "Finding the Middle Path":

- **Cooperatives movement in Punjab failed to take off due to excessive bureaucratic interference**

**VERGHESE KURIEN** (spearheaded AMUL movement):

- **Promotion of cooperatives provides viable and better alternative to MNC-led exploitative capitalism** followed in name of economic liberalization

## Agrarian Social Structure (127:02)

### Theoretical Framework

**ANDRE BETEILLE** considers study of agrarian social structure has **two major aspects**:

1. **Technological arrangements**: 
   
   - Geography in terms of soil fertility
   - Amount of rainfall received
   - Technology available (HYV seeds vs regular seeds, water pumps)

2. **Social arrangements**: 
   
   - Refers to agrarian stratification system
   - Social classes involved in ownership, control and use of land

### Classifications by Different Scholars

#### ARAM's Classification

**Divides agrarian society into three major classes**:

- **Upper class land owners**
- **Middle class land owners** 
- **Lower class land owners** (small and marginal farmers)

#### JAN BREMAN's Classification

**Studied Surat in Gujarat, divided farmers into three categories**:

- **Large farmers**: Own more than 15 acres of land
- **Middle farmers**: Own between 5 to 15 acres of land  
- **Small and marginal farmers**: Own less than 5 acres

**BREMAN suggests** apart from size of land holding, should also consider:

- Nature of soil and its productivity
- Irrigation facilities
- Availability of marketing infrastructure

### Caste vs Class Debate

#### ANDRE BETEILLE

**In "Class Structure in an Agrarian Society"**:

- **Jotedars of West Bengal** (agricultural caste) are moving towards transformation into a class
- **Class as form of stratified inequality is replacing caste**, but as yet it is amorphous (not clear)

#### PAULINE KOLENDA

**Study of Shripuram village in Tamil Nadu**:

- **Divided agrarian society into two main classes**: Owners of land and non-owners of land

**Study of village in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu**:

- **Caste has been clearly replaced by class in villages**
- **High castes replaced by middle class** (typically doctors or professionals living in city but owning land in village)
- **No rich in countryside** - opportunities for wealth lie outside village

### DANIEL THORNER's Classification

**Three-fold classification**:

1. **MALIK**: Big landlords who own large tracts of land
   
   - **Two types**: Absentee landlords or supervisory maliks

2. **KISAN**: Cultivators who typically have small tracts of land
   
   - Either own some tract of land or lease land from maliks
   - Use family labor and may hire outside labor to supplement
   - Hire labor on temporary/seasonal basis

3. **MAZDUR**: Those who do not own any land and only sell their labor
   
   - Include landless laborers, poor tenants and sharecroppers

### Government of India Classification

**Based on size of land holding**:

- **Marginal farmers**: Less than 1 hectare
- **Small farmers**: 1 to 2 hectares  
- **Semi-medium farmers**: 2 to 4 hectares
- **Medium farmers**: 4 to 10 hectares
- **Large farmers**: More than 10 hectares

**Current statistics**:

- **About 85% of all farmers are small and marginal**
- **Large farmers are mere 0.4% of all farmers**

| Classification System | Categories                                            | Key Criteria                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ARAM                  | Upper/Middle/Lower class land owners                  | Land ownership size            |
| JAN BREMAN            | Large (>15 acres)/Middle (5-15)/Small & Marginal (<5) | Land size + other factors      |
| DANIEL THORNER        | Malik/Kisan/Mazdur                                    | Relationship to land ownership |
| Government of India   | Marginal/Small/Semi-medium/Medium/Large               | Hectares of land owned         |

## Factionalism (150:23)

### Definition and Characteristics

- **Factionalism (Gutbazi)**: Village community divided into factions typically along kinship lines
- **Structure**: Within large extended family, different sets of cousins or descendants of same ancestor on different sides
- **Contrast with Gandhian view**: Emphasizes conflict rather than harmony and cooperation as characteristic of rural social life
- **Violence**: Regular conflict with violent manifestations

### Causes of Factionalism

**Range from petty to substantial issues**:

- Trivial matters like teasing or affairs
- Substantial issues like land ownership disputes
- Property inheritance quarrels  
- Family feuds over adoption of male child for succession
- Disputes over land and irrigation rights
- Sexual offenses and murders
- Rivalries between castes

### OSCAR LEWIS's Study

**Study of fictitiously named Rampur village near Delhi** (Hindu Jat village):

**Major causes identified**:

- Quarrels and disputes over property inheritance
- Family feuds over adoption of male child for succession
- Disputes over land and irrigation rights  
- Disputes caused by sexual offenses and murders
- Rivalries between castes

### Types of Factionalism

**Three types identified**:

1. **Resolvable conflicts**: Between parties with permanent or periodic resolution through votes or arbitration mechanism

2. **Group dissolution conflicts**: Between subgroups of larger group leading to dissolution of group with no resolution mechanism - permanent fracture

3. **Unorganized conflicts**: Between unorganized and transient groupings resulting in dissolution of major group and lack of cooperation between smaller groupings
