# Political System: Religion, Regionalism and Caste in Indian Politics

## Introduction and Ethnicity (17:24)

- **Ethnicity**: A sense of belongingness based on some shared element of culture like religion and language etc.

- **Ethno-nationalist movements in India**: 
  
  - Dravidian movement
  - Khalistan movement 
  - Pakistan movement (which has been quite successful)
  - Hindutva movement (quite successful in recent times)

- The discussion covers political system, regionalism and religion as interconnected themes in Indian politics

## Indian Secularism vs Western Secularism (21:17)

### Western Secularism

- **Western secularism**: About a very clear demarcation between state and religion
- Involves separation of religious institutions from state affairs

### Indian Secularism

- **Criticism of Nehru and secularism**: It was too liberal
- According to critics like **T.N. MADAN** and **PARTH CHATTERJEE**, the problem with Indian secularism is:
  - It sidelines religion essentially 
  - It cannot be sidelined in a society like India where bulk of the population is very religious

#### Arguments of Critics (T.N. Madan)

- **Main argument**: Secularism in India must factor in the import of religion in people's everyday lives
- It should not try to be a cheap or pale imitation of Western secularism  
- In Hindu philosophy itself you find a sufficient basis to create a secular society and polity
- Build upon that foundation so people will not be alienated
- The way it has been done since Nehru's times is impractical and inappropriate

#### T.N. Madan's Position

- **"Secularism is a social myth"**: It is the creation of ruling elites' minds, not the ground reality
- People are not secular by temperament because people are very strongly attached to their respective religious communities
- As a Hindu, I have a strong attachment and inclination towards fellow Hindus
- I do not have the same kind of allegiance or feeling towards Muslims
- It is impractical for elites to expect people to be secular

| Aspect                | Western Secularism                     | Indian Secularism (Critics' View)                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**          | Clear separation of state and religion | Should incorporate religious reality               |
| **Foundation**        | Modern political thought               | Should build on Hindu philosophical basis          |
| **Practicality**      | Works in less religious societies      | Impractical in highly religious society like India |
| **People's response** | Accepted in individualistic cultures   | Creates alienation from ruling elite ideology      |

## Communalism - Definition and Ideology (28:18)

### What Communalism is NOT

- **Not the same as fundamentalism**: Following fundamental tenets of faith does not make one communal
- **Not the same as religiosity**: Being a devout practicing Hindu/Muslim (daily puja, five times namaz) does not make one communal  
- **Not community preferences**: Having preference for one's religious community in matters of marriage, kinship is not communalism

### Definition of Communalism

- **Communalism**: An ideology that seeks to mobilize a religious community as a political group
- **More specifically**: Using religious identity for political purposes or political ends
- Communal politics try to politically mobilize a religious community by juxtaposing it against another religious community

#### Examples of Communal Appeals

- To Muslims: "All politically unite because Hindus are a threat to Muslim identity, Muslim culture, Muslim interests"
- To Hindus: "Unite and start voting in bloc as Hindus, otherwise Muslims are a demographic threat and Hindus will be reduced to a minority in India"

### Manifestations of Communalism

**According to BIPINCHANDRA**, communalism emphasizes:

- **The distinctiveness and even opposition** of the culture of a religious community to that of other religious communities
- Communal ideology seeks to further **protect and promote the socio-economic interests** of a particular religious group through political mobilization

#### Stages of Communal Development

1. **Stage 1**: Highlighting that cultures are different - "We do this, they do that, our religion vs their religion"  
2. **Stage 2**: From differences it turns into opposition - stark opposition between belief systems and rituals
3. **Stage 3**: Not just about religion and culture, becomes about socio-economic interests

**Example**: The communal Pakistan ideology argued that Muslims will be socio-economically dominated in a Hindu majority India - if 80% are Hindus, then political administrative system will remain dominated by Hindus in civil services, parliament, state legislatures.

### Forms of Expression

**The ideology of communalism may find expression in the form of**:

- Communal riots
- Targeted attacks on places of worship and residential quarters of other religious communities  
- Hate speech
- Communal polarization
- Communal tensions etc.

## Causative Factors of Communalism (44:29)

### 1. Colonial Policy of Divide and Rule

- **Popular view**: British sowed the seeds of communal disharmony
- Prior to British rule, various religious communities (Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains) were living side by side, co-existing peacefully for several centuries
- Very long tradition of peaceful co-existence till the British came and spoiled the party
- This view lays the blame squarely on British policy of divide and rule

#### Counter-argument by Scholars like T.R. SHARMA

- **Religion has been used for politico-administrative purposes in Indian society since long before colonial rule**
- British were not the fathers of mixing religion and politics - it was happening from civilizational childhood

**Historical Examples**:

- **Ancient period**: Various Hindu rulers relied on authority of religion, scriptural sanction, Brahmin priests conducting rituals like Ashwamedha Yajna
- **Divine theory of kingship** mixed religion and political administrative machinery
- **Battle between Brahmanical Hinduism and Buddhism** for political patronage - one reason cited for decline of Buddhism when it lost political patronage and shifted to Hinduism

#### Medieval Period Evidence

- **Discriminatory taxes like Jazia** imposed only on non-Muslims
- **Sikh Gurus** fighting continuous battle against Mughal rulers
- **Destruction of Hindu temples** by various Islamic rulers (as documented by scholars like SEETARAM GOYAL and RAMSAROOP)

**Conclusion**: British did not start the fire - our house was already on fire. British may have added ghee to the fire, but didn't light it.

### 2. Religious Reform Movements

**Contributing factors during colonial period**:

- **Shuddhi movement** by Arya Samaj  
- **Cow protection movement** started by Arya Samaj (cow raksha brigades)
- **Aligarh movement**: Meant to modernize Indian Muslims, but upper middle class and upper class Muslim elites who emerged also became founders of communal Pakistan ideology

### 3. Pakistan Movement

- **Most express form** of communal ideology  
- **Led by**: JINNA (political), SYED AHMAD KHAN (early stirrings)
- **Ideological father of Pakistan**: MOHAMMAD IQBAL
  - Same person who wrote "Tarana-e-Hindi" (Saare jahan se achha Hindustan hamara - "Religion does not teach mutual enmity, we are Hindus, our homeland is Hindustan")
  - Six years later his mindset changed completely - wrote "Tarana-e-Milli" on same meter: "China-o-Arab hamara, Hindustan hamara, Muslim hai hum watan hai saara jahan hamara"

### 4. Hindutva Ideology

**According to critics like ROMILA THAPAR, ASHUTOSH VARSHNEY**:

- **Hindutva is a divisive and communal ideology** because it seeks to politically mobilize the Hindus
- **Exclusionary approach**: Painting Muslims as an existential threat to Hindu identity and culture
- Demonizes Muslims and excludes Muslims from the idea of the nation

### 5. Congress Party's Role

**Congress was an umbrella organization** which contained within itself the Hindu right wing also

**Examples of Congress leaders using religious platforms**:

- **Leaders like PANDIT MADAN MOHAN MALVIYA**: Several Congress leaders used religious platforms for political mobilization  
- **TILAK popularized Ganpati festival** in Maharashtra
- **Durga Puja in Bengal** - politically used to educate masses, as people would gather for religious events where political speeches could be given

**Other Congress actions**:

- **Support to Khilafat cause** under Gandhi - which was not a national cause but religious cause, giving legitimacy to Muslim League politics
- **Popularized imagery of Bharat Mata** - seen as communal because imagery closely resembles Hindu goddess (saffron saree, lotus, four hands with Vedas and rosary)
- **Vande Mataram slogan** - context from Anandamath has communal undertones

## Communal Riots - Scholarly Analysis (68:41)

### PAUL BRASS Analysis

**Communal riots are NOT the result of spontaneous outburst of public anger**

#### Street Theater Analogy

- **BRASS suggests**: Communal riots are mostly like street theater
- Just like theater involves detailed planning, allocation of resources, coordination etc., communal riots require:
  - **Resources needed**: Diesel, swords, police complicity, police being absent
  - **Organization and planning**: Like theater preparation that takes months
  - **Director**: Typically local politicians who engineer the riots

**According to BRASS**:

- Riots are **engineered by local politicians** to garner votes
- If Hindu-Muslim polarization happens, Hindus will feel only "56 inch chest" person can save them from riotous Muslims
- Then people will start voting for 56 inches (reference to Modi)

### WILKINSON Analysis

**Highlights important role of the state in communal riots**

- **If it wants, the state can and does stop communal riots**
- State has sufficient capacity - government machinery can nip in the bud any communal tension if it wants
- **The state does so when the party in power will politically benefit by preventing the riots**

### ASHUTOSH VARSHNEY Analysis

**Urban vs Rural Pattern**:

- **Communal riots are mostly an urban phenomenon**, not rural
- This may be slightly counter-intuitive because one would expect people in villages to be more regressive in thinking, more committed to religion and religious identity

#### VARSHNEY's Data (1950-1995)

- **Only 4% of all deaths** in Hindu-Muslim riots were in villages  
- **96% deaths were in urban areas**

**Reasons for urban concentration**:

- High population concentration
- Media coverage  
- Anonymity in urban areas (easier to escape recognition after violence)
- In rural areas, perpetrators would be easily identified

#### Eight Riot-Prone Cities

**VARSHNEY identified eight cities** that are particularly riot-prone:

- These eight cities account for **49% of riot-related deaths**
- They together account for only **6% of India's population**

**The cities**: Delhi, Bombay, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Baroda, Aligarh, Meerut, Hyderabad

#### Civil Society Organizations Role

**What makes these eight cities particularly vulnerable?**

**VARSHNEY's finding**: In riot-prone cities, **civil society organizations of Hindus and Muslims were separate**

- **Where organizations have mixed membership** (both Hindu and Muslim members): Channel of communication remains open between communities, rumors can be dispelled
- **Where organizations are separate**: Rumors build up, no communication channel exists
- **Having mixed civil society organizations can serve as a bulwark against communal riots**

### GHANSHYAM SHAH (GHURE) Analysis

**Cultural Incompatibility Theory**:

- **Culture of the two main communities** (Hindus and Muslims) are not just different from each other
- **They are mutually incompatible**: Hindus worship cow, Muslims eat cow; Islam is monotheistic, Hinduism is polytheistic  
- **One sword cannot remain in one sheath**: Differences between communities are irreconcilable

#### GHURE's Arguments

- **Islam has failed to get absorbed into Indian culture** despite centuries of contact
- **Hardly any cultural rapprochement** - no middle path or scheme for peaceful coexistence
- **Chief instigators of communal riots are Muslims**
- **Muslims are unwilling to be fully integrated into the Indian nation** and therefore pose a threat to national unity

#### Counter-perspective

- GHURE was a very strong nationalist who saw threats in multiple groups:
  - Muslims as threat
  - Linguistic minorities as threat  
  - OBCs as threat
  - Tribal/North Eastern tribals as threat
- Basically, only upper caste (North Indian Brahmins) were considered ideal

### NORMAN PALMER Analysis

**Structural Incompatibility**:

- **"India is the most unlikely place to establish a secular state"**
- **Because it is a religiously impregnated society**
- Religion flows in our veins - if you tear open my chest, what will you see? "Mere Prabhu Shri Ram"

## Caste in Indian Politics (118:32)

### Theoretical Framework: Democracy vs Caste

#### Perceived Incompatibility

**Democracy and caste are seen as mutually incompatible**:

| **Caste System**                                       | **Democratic System**                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Based on principle of hierarchy                        | Based on principle of equality                                         |
| Generally perceived as regressive                      | Seen as progressive                                                    |
| Classic defining feature of traditional Indian society | Aspect of modern Indian political life                                 |
| Unit of analysis: Community                            | Emphasis on individual (individual rights, freedoms, one man one vote) |
| Seen as exclusive (excludes others)                    | Understood as inclusive (gives space for everyone)                     |
| Seen as oppressive and exploitative                    | Seen as empowering and liberating                                      |
| Ideological foundation in Hindu religious scriptures   | Traced to modern political thought (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau)           |

#### DR. B.R. AMBEDKAR's Pessimistic View

- **"Political democracy requires social democracy"**
- **"We will be entering an era of contradictions"** with independence
- **In politics**: Era of equality - all politically equal, one man one vote, all public offices open to everybody
- **In society and economy**: Stark inequalities of caste and income will remain
- **Conclusion**: Democratic development in India will be hampered by caste
- **Caste system is categorically against the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity**
- **Democracy will not be fruitful as long as we have caste inequality in society**
- Political equality will be a farce as long as we don't have social equality

#### Modernization Theorists' Optimistic View

**Leaders like NEHRU were more optimistic**:

- As India embarks on journey of modernization and becomes more modern, **caste will eventually die**
- Will be replaced by **class**
- With spread of modern education, scientific temper, rationality, constitutional ethos:
  - Democracy will deepen and break caste
  - Political modernization/spread of democracy will eventually lead to destruction of caste

### Actual Experience: Democracy and Caste Coexistence

**However, the operation of democratic political machinery in India over the last seven decades has shown us a very different experience**:

- **Neither democracy has been retarded nor has caste system broken**
- **Democratic experience since independence indicates otherwise** - that democracy and caste may not be incompatible
- **Caste has shown great resilience** - it has verily survived political modernization and deepening of democracy
- **Democracy has definitely deepened but caste has also maintained its relevance**

#### ANDRE BETEILLE's Analysis

**"Democratic politics has infused a new lease of life in the caste system"**

- Caste has been kept alive thanks to democratic politics
- **Democratic politics has kept alive caste**

### Scholarly Analysis of Caste in Politics

#### RAJNI KOTHARI's Framework

**"Politics involves identifying and manipulating existing and emerging identities in order to mobilize support"**

**Basic logic of democratic politics**:

- People are mobilized to seek their votes
- Different social groups fight among themselves electorally  
- Competition between different communities and social groups to claim greater share of societal pie
- Every community wants something from political administrative system

**Why caste works as political identity**:

- **Caste is a very readily available identity** based on which people can be very easily mobilized politically
- In Indian society, **caste provides a ready-made basis for political mobilization**

#### Kothari's Key Insight

**"It is not only politics which has become casteized, but also caste has been sufficiently politicized"**

- Caste now plays political roles it never did before
- Caste-based associations have emerged
- This is a new form of caste we are witnessing

### M.N. SRINIVAS Contributions

#### Vote Bank Concept

**SRINIVAS developed the concept of vote bank**:

- Originally meant patterns in Jajmani-type system where patrons mobilize votes of their clients
- **Today, vote bank means**: All votes of a particular community (caste, religious community, tribe) seen as captive vote bank, quite likely to vote en bloc for a particular political formation

#### Horizontal Stretch of Caste

**SRINIVAS gave concept called "horizontal stretch of caste"**:

**Traditional pattern**: Caste conventionally operated at local level

- Dominance was a localized affair  
- A caste enjoyed dominance in a village and group of nearby villages

**Modern transformation**: With improved transportation, communication facilities, mass media, and rising political consciousness:

- **Nearby castes are aggregating** to derive benefits such as acquiring political power at regional level
- **Example**: In UP and Bihar, various cow-herding castes such as Gwala, Ahir, Gopi came together under umbrella term **YADAV** to gain political influence at state level

**Facilitating factors**:

- Modern means of communication (pamphlets, newspapers)
- Modern transport  
- Helped caste leaders across different localities connect with each other
- Facilitated the stretching of caste beyond local boundaries

### Limitations of Caste in Politics

#### SUHAS PALSHIKAR's Analysis

**"Caste as an organizing principle in Indian politics has reached its limits"**

**Why caste factor gets neutralized**:

- **Caste arithmetic is known to everybody** and all political parties factor in the caste angle in ticket distribution
- **For a Jat constituency**: All major political parties will give tickets to Jat candidates mostly
- **Result**: Fight between Congress Jat, BJP Jat, and Samajwadi Party Jat
- **Caste factor stands neutralized** - can't appeal for votes based on caste alone
- **Politics has to be beyond caste** - must appeal on other criteria like development, clean track record, corruption issues, etc.

#### DEEPANKAR GUPTA's Numerical Reality

**"There are numerous castes in any political constituency"**:

- **Tens of castes present** - no single caste enjoys decisive vote share
- **Even most dominant castes lack numbers**:
  - **Western UP (Jatland)**: Jats are only 9% of population  
  - **Bihar**: Yadavs are merely 15% of total population
- **No single caste can ensure victory in elections** because even the most numerous don't have the numbers

**Conclusion**: **Electoral victory requires caste plus other factors** - beyond caste mobilization.

## Caste-based Movements in South India (169:39)

### Justice Party Movement in Tamil Nadu (1916)

#### Initial Focus

**Justice Party movement challenged Brahmanical domination in education and public employment**:

- **Problem identified**: Brahmins who constitute miniscule fraction of Tamil Nadu population are over-represented
- **Backward classes** who are bulk of population do not have access to lucrative government jobs - grossly under-represented

#### Evolution under PERIYAR Leadership

**Under E.V. RAMASWAMY NAICKER (Periyar), scope widened and it became**:

- **Self Respect Movement** 
- **Suyya Maryadai Movement** (Tamil for self-respect)

### Ideology of Self Respect Movement

#### Three Core Principles

1. **Self Respect**
2. **Rationalism** 
3. **Eradication of Caste**

#### Multi-dimensional Opposition

**The movement was simultaneously**:

| **Opposition Type**                 | **Details**                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anti-Caste**                      | Saw caste system as inegalitarian, exploitative, irrational                         |
| **Anti-Patriarchy**                 | Championed gender equality                                                          |
| **Anti-Brahmanical**                | Starting as anti-Brahmanical domination, became anti-Brahmin                        |
| **Anti-Aryan and Anti-North India** | Argued Dravidian culture superior to North Indian Aryan culture                     |
| **Anti-Congress**                   | Saw Congress as party dominated by upper caste North Indian Aryans                  |
| **Anti-Religion**                   | Religion seen as irrational, promoted rationalism                                   |
| **Anti-Hinduism**                   | Hinduism seen as foreign imposition by alien Brahmins on Dravidians                 |
| **Anti-Hindi**                      | Resisted attempts to impose Hindi, celebrated Tamil culture and identity            |
| **Anti-National**                   | Later demanded establishment of separate Dravidanad (homeland for Dravidian people) |

#### Core Ideological Framework (IRSCHICK's Analysis)

**The Self Respect Movement**:

- **Glorified Dravidian culture** as egalitarian, rational and superior to Aryan culture
- **Targeted Brahmins** as agents of foreign Aryan culture who introduced:
  - Oppressive caste system
  - Patriarchal ideology among Dravidian society
- **Anti-Hinduism rationale**: Hinduism responsible for caste system which denied privileges and access to opportunities to bulk of population
- **Later became anti-Hindi**: Resisted language-based politics, celebrated Tamil identity
- **Anti-national element**: Demanded confederation of Dravidian states as separate homeland

### Assessment of the Movement

#### Successes

1. **Challenge to Brahmanical dominance**: Largely successful
   
   - Tamil Nadu has reservation up to 69% implemented since several decades
   - Large number of people from backward classes have penetrated education system and public services

2. **Anti-Hindi agenda**: Quite successful  
   
   - Anti-Hindi sentiment still widely prevalent in Tamil Nadu
   - Tamil people retain strong linguistic pride

3. **Anti-Congress**: Successful
   
   - Congress last in power in 1960s - once kicked out, remained out of power
   - Power oscillates between **DMK** and **AIADMK** (both children of Suyya Maryadai movement)
   - Congress has no major role in Tamil Nadu politics

4. **Use of popular cinema**: Leaders successfully mobilized popular cinema to propagate ideology
   
   - Many tallest leaders have been cine stars, writers (KARUNANIDHI, JAYALALITHAA, MGR)

#### Limitations

1. **Geographic limitation**: Impact largely confined to Tamil Nadu
   
   - Not successful in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka
   - Failed to create envisioned alliance against North Indian Aryan culture among Dravidian states

2. **Religious contradiction**: Anti-Hinduism rhetoric vs ground reality
   
   - Tamil people remain very devout Hindus and very religious  
   - Tamil Nadu has one of largest numbers of temples in India
   - Has not made Tamil people atheistic despite anti-Hindu rhetoric

3. **Caste persistence**: Despite anti-caste stance, caste has not died out in Tamil Nadu

4. **Separatist agenda abandoned**: Anti-national rhetoric of separate Dravidanad was given up during 1962 Sino-Indian War when central government cracked down on seditious speeches

**Overall**: Movement had mixed success - achieved many political goals but failed to fundamentally transform society on religious and caste dimensions.

| **Hindutva Ideology**          | Critics' Analysis              | • ROMILA THAPAR, ASHUTOSH VARSHNEY • Divisive, exclusionary, anti-Muslim • Paints Muslims as existential threat                                                                                                    |
| **Congress Role**              | Communal Elements              | • Umbrella organization with Hindu right wing • TILAK's Ganpati, MALVIYA's religious platforms • Khilafat support, Bharat Mata imagery, Vande Mataram                                                              |
| **Communal Riots**             | PAUL BRASS Theory              | • NOT spontaneous outbursts • Like street theater: planned, organized • Need resources, police complicity • Engineered by local politicians for votes                                                              |
| **Riots Analysis**             | WILKINSON's State Role         | • State can stop riots if it wants • Has sufficient capacity • Does so when party benefits politically                                                                                                             |
| **Riots Pattern**              | VARSHNEY's Urban Focus         | • Mostly urban phenomenon (96% deaths) • Only 4% deaths in villages • Eight riot-prone cities: 49% deaths, 6% population                                                                                           |
| **Civil Society Role**         | VARSHNEY's Solution            | • Mixed organizations prevent riots • Separate organizations increase vulnerability • Communication channels crucial for peace                                                                                     |
| **Cultural Theory**            | GHURE's Incompatibility        | • Hindu-Muslim cultures mutually incompatible • Islam failed to absorb into Indian culture • Muslims as chief instigators, threat to unity ⭐ (This represents GHURE's controversial views, not factual assessment) |
| **Democracy vs Caste**         | Theoretical Opposition         | • Caste: hierarchy, regressive, exclusive, traditional • Democracy: equality, progressive, inclusive, modern • AMBEDKAR: Need social democracy for political democracy                                             |
| **Modernization Theory**       | NEHRU's Optimism               | • Caste will die with modernization • Will be replaced by class • Education, rationality will break caste                                                                                                          |
| **Actual Experience**          | Coexistence Reality            | • Neither democracy retarded nor caste broken • ANDRE BETEILLE: Democracy gave caste new life • Caste maintained relevance despite democratic deepening                                                            |
| **KOTHARI's Analysis**         | Political Mobilization         | • Politics involves manipulating identities • Caste provides ready-made basis • Not only politics casteized, caste also politicized                                                                                |
| **SRINIVAS Concepts**          | Vote Bank & Horizontal Stretch | • Vote bank: Captive community votes • Horizontal stretch: Local castes aggregating regionally • Example: YADAV identity from multiple cow-herding castes                                                          |
| **Caste Limitations**          | PALSHIKAR & GUPTA              | • Caste arithmetic known to all parties • Multiple castes in each constituency • No single caste has decisive numbers • Need caste-plus factors for victory                                                        |
| **South Indian Movements**     | Justice Party (1916)           | • Challenged Brahmanical dominance in jobs/education • Under PERIYAR became Self Respect Movement • Three principles: self-respect, rationalism, caste eradication                                                 |
| **Self Respect Ideology**      | Multiple Oppositions           | • Anti-caste, anti-patriarchy, anti-Brahmin • Anti-Aryan, anti-Congress, anti-religion • Anti-Hinduism, anti-Hindi, anti-national • Glorified Dravidian over Aryan culture                                         |
| **Movement Assessment**        | Successes & Limitations        | • Success: 69% reservation, anti-Hindi sentiment, anti-Congress • Limitations: Only Tamil Nadu, Hinduism still strong, caste persists • Used cinema effectively for propaganda                                     |
