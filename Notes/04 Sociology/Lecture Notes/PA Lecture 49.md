# Work in Contemporary Society, Alienation and Informal Organization

## INTRODUCTION AND RECAP (20:41)

- In the last lecture, we had covered and begun with the unit on **Work and Economic Life**
- We have discussed and compared work in **slave, feudal and capitalist societies**
- Quick mention regarding work in capitalist society - we specifically covered **management approaches**:
  - **Scientific Management Approach**
  - **Human Relations Approach**

### Scientific Management - Taylor's Four Principles

1. **Scientifically analyze and break down the task**

2. **Scientific selection of workers** (first select, then train)

3. **Scientific training of the workers**

4. **Cooperation between workers and management**
- This can result in:
  - Significant reduction in wastage
  - Significant increase in production efficiency
  - A mental revolution ushering in an era of industrial peace and harmony

## WORK IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY (24:27)

- **Contemporary society** refers to today's work conditions, not specifically mentioned in syllabus but important from exam point of view
- This is the most frequently asked portion from work - they will seldom ask about slave or feudal society, little more about industrial capitalism, and quite frequently regarding work in contemporary society

### Difference from Industrial Capitalism

- **Question**: Is contemporary society any different from work in industrial capitalism?
- **Key difference**: Nature of jobs is changing
  - **Earlier**: Most jobs were manufacturing/factory jobs (blue collar jobs)
  - **Now**: White collar jobs, higher structure, rise of equity

### Post-Industrial Society Characteristics

- Western economies since middle of 20th century have entered what is called the **post-industrial phase**

- Also called:
  
  - **Post-modern societies**
  - **Post-industrial economies** 
  - **Knowledge economy**
  - **Information societies**

- **Defining feature**: Shift from manufacturing to services sector

- Even in India, the biggest chunk of GDP comes from services, and we are not yet even a fully modern society

### Economic Sectors Transformation

| Sector     | Type                | Examples                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary    | Agriculture, Mining | Farming, extractive industries                                    |
| Secondary  | Manufacturing       | Factories, industrial production                                  |
| Tertiary   | Services            | Banking, education, healthcare                                    |
| Quaternary | Higher services     | Higher education, research & development                          |
| Quinary    | Elite services      | High-paying consultancy, top government jobs (Golden collar jobs) |

### Services vs Manufacturing

- **Manufacturing**: Things were produced - goods, tangibles you could touch and feel (automobiles, shoes, shirts)
- **Services**: Services are rendered - you cannot touch and feel
  - Education (part of service sector)
  - Banking and financial services
  - Insurance
  - Restaurants (you pay for the service, not just the ₹5 potato)
  - Hair cuts/salon services
  - Hospitality
  - Medical services
  - Tourism
  - Health care

## KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY AND KNOWLEDGE WORKERS (37:42)

### Key Scholars and Concepts

- **DANIEL BELL** and **ALAIN TOURAINE** - elaborated on post-modern society
- **PETER DRUCKER** - termed this post-industrial economy as **Knowledge Economy**

### Knowledge Workers vs Manual Workers

- **Knowledge workers** drive the knowledge economy
- They are engaged in:
  - **Production of ideas** (not goods)
  - **Processing of information**
- This contrasts with manual workers who were producing things/physical objects

### Late Capitalism (Marxist Perspective)

- **Marxist scholars** use the term **Late Capitalism** to refer to this post-modern/post-industrial society
- Features of Late Capitalism:
  - **Globalization of capital flows**
  - **Integration of markets**
  - **Emergence of multinational corporations**

### Peter Drucker's Contribution

- Drucker suggests that Marx should be replaced by TAYLOR
- "Taylor has made Marx redundant"
- **Question**: Why didn't working class revolution happen?
  - Because of scientific revolution and immense gains in productivity
  - Much of the benefit got passed on to workers
  - "The proletariat became bourgeois"
- Drucker credits Taylor's scientific management for America's victory in World Wars

## GIG ECONOMY (40:04)

### Definition and Characteristics

- **Gig**: Person not committed to any permanent organization, part-time work
- **No formal employer-employee relationship** in gig economy
- Examples: Uber, Zomato, Swiggy, food delivery apps, cab rental apps, Zepto

### Features of Gig Economy

**Workers in gig economy:**

- Are engaged for **short-term contractual tasks**
- Do **not have fixed work timings**
- The organization providing gig work, gig worker, and client **do not have long-term commitments** to each other
- Commitment is only **that the gig to be performed**

### Impact on Nature of Work

**Advantages:**

- **Greater freedom** and flexibility
- **Multiple streams of income** (can work for multiple organizations)
- Worker can choose when to work (e.g., Uber driver can decide daily rides)

**Disadvantages:**

- **Workers do not have social security**
- **Employers do not have commitment to provide social security or job security**
- **Workers are at the mercy of organizations**
- **Legislative/regulatory framework for gig arrangements still being worked out**

### Rise of Employeeless Organizations

- **Gig economy has given rise to employeeless organizations**
- Large companies with huge revenues but not large workforce
- Companies like Uber don't own cabs, Airbnb don't own hotels
- **Mind-boggling**: Some of biggest cab rental companies don't own cabs or have drivers on payroll

### Why Organizations Prefer Gig Model

- **Much cheaper** to have work done
- **Don't have to provide benefits** to workers
- **Easy to fire** if performance lacks  
- **Don't need infrastructure**
- **Easy to get out of market/test market** with minimal investment
- **Save on infrastructure costs**
- **Escape obligations toward workforce** (long-term commitments, welfare legislation)
- **Overhead costs reduced**

### Worker Perspective on Gig Economy

- In America, about **one-third of all workers** are engaged in such short-term engagements
- **Why do employees prefer gig over conventional jobs?**
  - Conventional jobs offer stability and regular income
  - **Gig offers flexibility** 
  - Workers are preferring **flexibility over income stability**
  - Can spend time with family, choose not to work on certain days
  - **Multiple work culture** - can work for multiple employers

### Arguably Less Alienation

- **Less alienation in gig economy** because:
  - Less under control of employer/boss
  - **You are your own boss** in gig economy

## NEW WORK MODELS (45:45)

### Modern Work Arrangements

**Work is based on new models such as:**

- **Flexi time**
- **Work from home**
- **Freelancing**
- **Remote login**

### Recent Trends

**The Great Resignation:**

- Large number of knowledge workers, very handsomely compensated, are resigning voluntarily
- **Reasons for resignation:**
  - Dissatisfaction from work
  - Hostile work environment  
  - Stagnant wages
- **Indicates that workers are alienated** - not happy

**Post-Pandemic Refusal:**

- Many workers refused to return to workplace after pandemic
- Preference for work from home
- Workers realized unnecessary travel time, being deprived of comfort of home
- **Again indicates people are not happy** with traditional work arrangements

**Quiet Quitting:**

- Workers **work only as per formal contractual requirements and no more**
- **No overtime**, will not take work back home
- **Indicates workers are not engaged in work**

## NEW ECONOMY AND PROSUMERS (97:43)

### Social Media Economy

- **New economy**: Social media has spawned huge amounts of wealth
- Examples: Reels, TikTok videos, YouTube content creation

### Prosumers Concept

- **ALVIN TOFFLER** coined term **Prosumers** (Producer + Consumer)
- **AXEL BRUNS** uses term **Produsage** to refer to **user-led content production**

**In produsage:**

- **Strict producer-consumer dichotomy does not exist**
- **Users/consumers are also producers of content**

### Key Features of Produsage

1. **User-led content production**
2. **Collaborative online environment**  
3. **Iterative development**
4. **Alternative approaches to intellectual property**

### Examples of Produsage

- **Wikipedia**
- **Memes** 
- **Citizen journalism**
- **Instagram**

**Characteristics:**

- **Collaborative online environment** (e.g., Wikipedia - multiple people edit entries)
- **Iterative development** (e.g., memes work and spread through iterations)

### Alienation in New Economy

- **In online work environments, frequently the person is the product**
- Example: "What have you purchased from IAS Gurukul? Me. I am the product"
- **We are continuously selling ourselves**

## ALIENATION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY (56:08)

### Marx's Original Concept

- **KARL MARX** formulated concept of **alienation** while analyzing work conditions in **early industrial capitalism (19th century)**
- Marx's concept seems quite appropriate to understand nature of work in 19th century industrial English society

### Changes Since Marx's Time

- **Nature of work in Western societies has changed substantially since Marx's time**
- **Workers of today are vastly different from workers of Marx's time**

### Important Developments

**Capitalism has transformed from exploitative to welfare capitalism:**

- 20th century Western capitalist economies transitioned to **welfare capitalism**
- **State has taken upon itself many welfare duties**
- **Passed many pro-worker legislations:**
  - Minimum wage laws
  - Laws governing conditions at workplace
  - Laws provisioning for social security of workforce

**Why this transformation?**

- **Western societies have democratic polity**
- **Democracy is a numbers game**
- **Working class numerically far more than capitalists**
- **Governments have to be responsive to workers' needs**

### Collective Bargaining Power

- **Workers enjoy sufficient strength for collective bargaining**
- **Trade union movement has gone from strength to strength**
- **Logic of collective bargaining**: Individual worker is powerless before capitalist, but together workers can pressure capitalist

### Improved Material Conditions

- **Workers today far better off materially than in Marx's time**
- **Growth of affluent workers** (GOLDTHORPE AND LOCKWOOD study)
- **Many manual workers enjoying middle-class level incomes**
- Example: Working class homes in America have air conditioners, washing machines, TVs

### More Leisure Time

- **Workers today have far more leisure time than in early capitalism**
- **Legislative regulation of work hours**
- **Substantial reduction in working hours**: From 18-19 hours/day to 8 hours/5 days week
- Some societies contemplating **four-day work weeks**

### Work-Life Balance

- **In contemporary times, lot of emphasis placed on work-life balance**
- **Work should not be the sole thing in your life**
- **What you do other than work is essential** - spending time with loved ones, holidays, pursuing passions and hobbies

### New Management Techniques

**Managements taking increasingly good care of workers:**

- **Job rotation** (6 months one duty, then another to add variety)
- **Innovative workshops and skill enhancement** at company expense
- **Work from home options**
- **Team-based activities**
- **Yoga retreats and meditation**
- **Inviting work places** (example: Infosys campus with pool table, gym, quality food)

### Service Sector Advantages

- **Lot of people engagement** in service sector
- **Not dealing with large lifeless machines**
- **Knowledge economy** involves information and knowledge processing - mind remains engaged, less likely to get bored
- **Continuously dealing with people**, don't get disconnected from society

## ROBERT BLAUNER'S STUDY (70:16)

### Technology and Alienation Relationship

- **ROBERT BLAUNER** investigated relationship between **improvements in technology and worker alienation**
- **Marx's view**: As technology improves, alienation increases (reaches peak in capitalist society)
- **Technology takes away skill, initiative, ingenuity from worker**
- **Technological improvements lead to de-skilling of workforce**
- **Technology replaces/displaces human labor**

### Blauner's Research Method

- Studied worker alienation in **four sectors of economy**:
  1. **Printing** (pre-industrial technology)
  2. **Textiles** (early capitalism) 
  3. **Automobiles** (advanced capitalism)
  4. **Chemicals manufacturing** (very advanced technology)

### Key Findings

| Sector      | Technology Level | Expected Alienation | Actual Alienation      |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Printing    | Pre-industrial   | Low                 | Low                    |
| Textiles    | Early industrial | Medium              | Medium                 |
| Automobiles | Advanced         | High                | **Highest**            |
| Chemicals   | Very advanced    | **Highest**         | Lower than automobiles |

### Surprising Results

- **Highest alienation found in automobiles industry**, not chemicals
- **Why chemicals manufacturing less alienating?**
  - Despite more technological intervention, **workers felt high degree of responsibility for final outcome**
  - Workers felt they were playing very important role

### Blauner's Conclusion

- **Technological advancement does not necessarily mean increase in worker alienation**
- **Technology can also enrich and make work more creative and engaging**
- Examples:
  - Accounting software simplifies boring/routine tasks
  - CAD software for architects frees them for creative dimensions
  - Internet makes studying more engaging with graphics and videos

**However**, alienation does not go away - it's not an alienation-free society, only that there's **not a linear relationship between technological advancement and alienation**

## C. WRIGHT MILLS ON SERVICE SECTOR ALIENATION (80:39)

### Personality Market Concept

- **C. WRIGHT MILLS** says that in service sector dominated economy, a **personality market has emerged**
- **Personality market**: Where pieces of personality are bought and sold
- **Aspects of personality are bought and sold in personality market**

### America as Big Sales Room

- Mills compares **20th century America to a big sales room**
- **Everywhere, everybody is engaged in selling** - not just in shops, but also in offices, board rooms, flights, malls
- **People are selling bits of their personality**

### Faking Personality for Sales

- **In order to close a sale, we are all faking bits of our personality**
- **People are faking their personalities**

**Classic example**: Air hostess

- "How can I help you sir?" (with fake plastic smile)
- **What is she doing? Faking a personality because her job requires certain kind of personality**

### Personal Examples from Lecturer

- **Job interview example**: "Tell us about yourself"
- For banking/sales job: "I am ultra-friendly, I love to travel" (faking personality to sell myself)
- **Insurance sales example**: Senior took 4-year-old daughter on sales call as prop
- **Doctor friend example**: Had to maintain serious face despite being jovial person

### White Collar Worker Alienation

- **White collar workers in service economy are also alienated**
- **If I'm continuously faking myself to you, can I establish strong bond with fellow human beings?**
- **I'm not being who I am, and when for most of day I'm not being who I am, I'm also alienated from my own self**

**Therefore**: White collar workers in service economy are **alienated from both wider society and themselves**

## HERBERT MARCUSE ON LEISURE (92:05)

### Leisure and Alienation

- Critics say workers now have leisure time for self-fulfillment
- **HERBERT MARCUSE** argues: **Leisure is as alienating as work in capitalism**
- **Leisure dominated by mass media**
- **Leisure time dominated by mass media is as alienating as work**
- No escape from alienation even in leisure time
- Example: Watching shows like Big Boss

## FORMAL AND INFORMAL ORGANIZATION OF WORK (110:17)

### Two Interpretations

**First interpretation** (already covered):

- **WEBER** - Bureaucracy theory talks about **formal organization**
- **PETER BLAU** - criticized Weber, suggested informal mechanisms can be more efficient
- **ELTON MAYO** - in every formal organization exists an informal organization

**Second interpretation**: 

- **Informal workers** and **informal sector of economy**

## INFORMAL SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY (112:50)

### What is Informal Sector?

- **Bulk of India's workforce engaged in informal sector**
- **Informal workers**: Those who do not have job security and social security
- **Cash economy** - informal sector runs primarily on cash

### Definitions of Informal Sector

### Distinguishing Formal vs Informal

| Formal Sector Examples       | Informal Sector Examples |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| TATA                         | Local grocery shop       |
| Bharat Petroleum             | Puncture repair shop     |
| Large companies (India Inc.) | Roadside dhaba           |
|                              | Home tutors              |
|                              | Fruit/vegetable vendors  |
|                              | Weekend markets          |

## IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION ON INFORMALIZATION (130:00)

### Expected vs Actual Impact

**Expectation**: Informal sector should shrink and formal segment should expand as globalization spreads
**Reality**: **Globalization is resulting in further informalization of economy**

### Reasons for Informalization

#### 1. Intensified Competition

- **Intense competition between companies under globalization**
- **Companies preferring to hire informal workers to cut down costs**
- **In India**: Formal sector corporations having informal workers through contracting out

#### 2. Competition Between Countries

- **Intense competition between countries/governments for attracting FDI**
- **Governments reducing pro-worker legislation to facilitate investments**
- **Rolling out red carpet for MNCs**
- **Loosening labor laws** including Modi government's four labor codes

#### 3. Pattern of Economic Growth

- **High rate of economic growth since globalization**
- **But period has been largely of jobless growth**
- **In formal sector, not enough jobs being created**
- **People moving to informal sector when formal jobs unavailable**

#### 4. Economic Crisis Periods

- **2008 global financial crisis**
- **COVID pandemic**
- **Decline in formal employment, rise in informal employment**

#### 5. Economic Restructuring

- **Privatization of public sector enterprises**
- **Retrenched workers move into informal economy**
- **Private enterprises are profit-driven, tend to retrench workers**

#### 6. Insufficient Income Levels

- **Income levels in formal sector not sufficient to fulfill growing aspirations**
- **People seek alternative avenues to supplement income**
- **Example**: Infosys employee doing tuition on side

#### 7. Outsourcing

- **Companies in developed countries outsourcing jobs to informal sector in developing countries**
- **From formal first world jobs to informal third world jobs**
- **Sweat shops in Bangladesh and India with pathetic conditions**

### Need to Regulate Informal Sector

#### Why Regulation Needed

1. **Income levels**: Average income of informal worker far below formal worker
2. **Strong correlation between informality and poverty** (CHARLES AND SEETHMAN studies)
3. **Working without minimum wages, social security, certainty of regular income**

#### Gender Inequality in Informal Sector

- **Women workers more concentrated in informal sector** (fewer skills, lesser access to education)
- **Linkage between working in informal sector and poverty is stronger for women than men**
- **Gender gap in wages in informal sector**
- **Women deal with perishable items** (fruits, vegetables - short shelf life)
- **Men deal with non-perishables** (shoes, pens - no limited shelf life)

#### Impact of Globalization on Gender

- **As globalization leads to informalization, more men join informal sector**
- **Women workers pushed further down in informal economy**
- **Strong linkage between informal work, poverty and gender**
- **Linkages reinforced by globalization**

### Challenges in Regulating Informal Sector

1. **Require comprehensive data** - need detailed research and proper documentation (difficult to get)
2. **Require in-depth analysis** - need to identify linkages between globalization and informal economy position of women/gender
3. **Require action programs** - ensure global competitiveness of workers in informal sector
4. **Require proper policy framework** - develop social security mechanism for informal sector workers
5. **Formalizing the informal sector**
6. **Collective bargaining power** - formal sector workers have trade unions, informal workers bear burden alone

## WORK FROM HOME (157:22)

### Definition and Scope

- **Work from home not a new thing** and **not just an IT/online thing**
- **Very old concept** - even before industrialization
- Examples: Beedi industry, dolls and toys, clothing - work from home very popular

### ILO Homework Convention Definition

**Homework defined as work carried out by person:**

- **In his home or other premises of his choice**
- **Other than workplace of employer**
- **For remuneration** (not domestic chores)
- **Which results in production of product or service as specified by employer**
- **Irrespective of who provides equipment, materials and other inputs used**

### Types of Homework

#### 1. Industrial Homework

- **Products that home workers produce as part of and in place of factory production**
- **Items like**: Beedi, toys, dolls, fire crackers, tobacco, textiles, baskets, handicrafts, sarees, etc.

#### 2. Tele Work

- Example: ICICI customer service from home

#### 3. Home-based Digital Platform Work

- **Service sector tasks performed by crowd workers according to specifications of employer**

### Conditions for Homework (ILO)

**Homework found when three conditions fulfilled:**

1. **Production process can be disassembled into discrete tasks**
2. **Capital required for production is accessible at relatively low cost**
   - Example: Middle class can afford PC/laptop, woman can afford sewing machine
3. **Labor force available with requisite skills**

### Global Statistics

- **Before pandemic**: 7.9% of world's employment were home-based workers
- **56% of all home-based workers are women**

### Serious Ramifications

#### Gender Impact (ASHWINI DESHPANDE)

- **Impact of pandemic has been gendered**
- **Women's experience of work from home different from men**
- **For women**: Dual burden - increase in domestic chores and domestic responsibilities
- **Resulted in "shadow pandemic"** - increase in domestic violence

#### Research Findings

**MARIA MIES** - studied homework by lace makers in Narsapur village, Andhra Pradesh:

- **Work by women often regarded as non-work** (even when paid)

**RUKMANI SEN** - highlighted **rise in incidence of domestic abuse due to work from home in India**

#### Child Labor Issues

- **Child labor becomes difficult to tackle** when work from home practices exist
- **Children often involved in work from home at very low pay levels**

| Homework Type    | Examples                     | Key Characteristics              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Industrial       | Beedi, toys, textiles        | Part of factory production chain |
| Tele Work        | Customer service, IT support | Remote digital services          |
| Digital Platform | Crowd-sourced tasks          | Service sector, crowd workers    |
