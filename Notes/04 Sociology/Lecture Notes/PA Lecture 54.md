# Sociology and Common Sense & Comparison with Other Social Sciences

## Introduction and Pending Topics (12:56)

- Today we should be able to complete the syllabus and discuss at least the more difficult questions in this year's UPSC Sociology paper
- Pending topics from the unit of Sociology the discipline:
  - Scope of the subject
  - Comparison of sociology with common sense
  - Comparison of sociology with other social sciences

## What is Common Sense (14:45)

- **Common Sense**: Refers to practical knowledge which is considered as obvious
- Common sense refers to sound judgment which most people possess, based on which they are able to live their lives in a safe, practical and sensible manner
- Common sense is often based on and reflected in popular proverbs, native wisdom, popular proverbs, intuition, prudence and reason which guide us in our daily life

### Examples of Common Sense

- "Empty vessels make much noise" 
- We don't put fingers in fans - this is common sense, not taught knowledge
- Building jumping is avoided through common sense

### Characteristics of Common Sense

- It is that intuitive knowledge which every member of society is expected to have and possess
- It is considered somewhat innate - something we are born with
- Even if we acquire it with age, it doesn't require any specialized training and education
- It is something you acquire if you are a practical person, reasonably intelligent and thinking person

## How Sociology Differs from Common Sense (28:02)

### Major Differences

**1. Scientific and Systematic Study**

- **Sociology**: Involves a scientific, systematic study of society
- **Common Sense**: No systematic analysis of social life; scientific approach is missing

**2. Empirical Testing and Scientific Procedure**

- **Sociology**: Relies upon empirical testing of its hypothesis
  - You begin with a hypothesis proposing relationship between variables
  - You collect data, process it, apply to hypothesis
  - Then you arrive at conclusions
- **Common Sense**: Relies upon received wisdom from ancestors and elders

**3. Sociological vs Common Sensical Understanding**

- Sociological analysis and understanding of various social phenomena often stands in stark contrast to the common sensical explanation of that phenomena
- For example: Common sensical understanding of poverty could be that it is due to laziness, but sociological analysis reveals that it is due to structural factors

**4. Level of Analysis**

- **Common Sense**: Often relies upon individual level reasoning, biological reasoning, or appeals to nature
- **Sociology**: Looks for causative factors in the society, seeks explanation in the nature of society

### C. WRIGHT MILLS and Sociological Imagination

- To understand any phenomena sociologically, we must apply the **SOCIOLOGICAL IMAGINATION**
- This means:
  - Connect the individual to the social
  - Connect the present to the past  
  - Connect the personal to the political

**Examples of Sociological Imagination:**

*Unemployment Analysis:*

- **Common Sense**: Individual is lazy, doesn't study, doesn't upgrade skills
- **Sociological**: Millions of youth suffer from unemployment due to structural factors - not adequate employment being generated

*Drug Addiction Analysis:*

- **Common Sense**: Individual lack of control, frustration
- **Sociological**: Societal issue affecting scores of youth due to societal causative factors (like in Punjab due to Green Revolution effects, mechanization, porous borders)

### Additional Characteristics of Sociology

**5. Reflexive Nature and Organized Skepticism**

- Sociology is characterized by **organized skepticism**
- You don't have to accept any conclusion
- It continuously challenges its own knowledge base
- Has self-corrective mechanism
- In common sense, you cannot question beyond a point - "it's too obvious to be questioned"

**6. Scholar Perspectives on Common Sense**

- **DURKHEIM**: Argued vehemently against use of common sense in sociological research
- Said common sensical understanding should not be allowed to contaminate sociological research
- Keep common sense aside while conducting sociological research
- Treat social facts as things

**From Marxist Perspective:**

- Common sense is part of the ruling class ideology
- It makes the rule of the ruling class appear natural and obvious
- Common sense from Marxist perspective is status quo-ist

## Areas of Convergence Between Sociology and Common Sense (50:02)

### Where They Overlap

**1. Source of Hypothesis Formation**

- Common sense can be a source of formulating hypothesis for sociological research

**2. Theoretical Alignment** 

- Sociological theory and perspective frequently align with common sense
- **Functional theory** often makes the same arguments as common sensical in more sophisticated academic language
- Functional explanations of social phenomena coincide with common sensical explanations

**Example:** Women's confinement to domestic sphere

- **Common Sense**: God made them for mothering, they have to breastfeed, their body is weaker
- **Functional Theory**: Similar explanation in academic language

**3. Ethnomethodology**

- **Ethnomethodologists** acknowledge common sense as the basis on which social reality is constructed by people
- Scholars like GARFINKEL, BERGER, SCHUTZ reject the scientific method
- Their job as sociologists is to study the methods that ordinary people use to construct their social world, including common sense

**4. Research Concepts to Common Understanding**

- Sometimes sociological research throws up concepts which become part of our common sense understanding
- **Example**: M.N. SRINIVAS's concept of "vote bank" - originally a research concept, now part of common understanding

### Utility Comparison

| Aspect                 | Common Sense                       | Sociology                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily Life Application | Far more useful in day-to-day life | Relatively less application or limited application                          |
| Popularity             | Everybody is presumed to have it   | Few people know sociology                                                   |
| Practical Use          | Used in daily life situations      | Has application in governance, policy formulation, social work, criminology |
| Scope                  | More practical and immediate       | More analytical and research-oriented                                       |

## Sociology and Other Social Sciences (57:38)

### Founding Fathers' Approach

- The founding fathers were absolutely clear that sociology has nothing to do with other disciplines
- One of their main endeavors was to carve out a **distinctive identity**
- They were trying to carve out a niche area of investigation for the then nascent discipline of sociology

### Current Status

- Over the past more than 150 years, sociology as a discipline has matured
- Its roots have deepened and it has become very sure of its distinctive identity
- Today sociology **freely borrows from and contributes to various other disciplines**
- Sociology has developed a **truly interdisciplinary approach**

## Sociology and History (64:01)

### Key Differences

| Aspect           | History                                                   | Sociology                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time Orientation | Past focused - study of the past                          | Present focused - study of modern society                 |
| Focus Area       | Political aspects, dynasties, kings, political events     | Various aspects of social life including political        |
| Approach         | **Idiographic** - focuses on unique events                | **Nomothetic** - focuses on patterns and generalizations  |
| Method           | Explains unique events (Battle of Panipat, 1857 uprising) | Identifies patterns (urbanization, family nuclearization) |

### Areas of Convergence

**1. Data Dependency**

- Sociologists often rely upon data supplied by historians

**2. Historical Materialism**

- **MARX and ENGELS** used historical materialist approach
- Analysis of society also analyzes historical development of society
- Required close collaboration between sociologists and historians

**3. Evolutionary Theories**

- Scholars like **HERBERT SPENCER** traced developments in society overtime
- **COMTE**: Theological to metaphysical to positive stage
- **SPENCER**: From simple to compound to doubly compound to trebly compound

**4. Unique Events Study**

- Sometimes sociologists also study unique events
- **Example**: WEBER's study of rise of capitalism in Europe

**5. Overlapping Branches**

- **Historical Sociology**: Study of societies in the past
- **Social History**: Study of nature of society in the past
- Substantial overlap in subject matter between these branches

## Sociology and Anthropology (74:17)

### Key Differences

| Aspect                 | Anthropology                                               | Sociology                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Focus Society          | Small, primitive/tribal, pre-modern societies              | Large, complex, modern industrial societies |
| Scale                  | Small scale societies                                      | Large scale societies                       |
| Complexity             | Simple societies                                           | Complex societies                           |
| Methods                | Ethnography, participant observation, qualitative research | Quantitative methodologies, surveys, census |
| Subject Matter Overlap | Overlaps with biology, archaeology                         | Focus on social institutions                |

### Context of Emergence

**Anthropology:**

- Emerged in context of **European colonialism**
- Europeans wanted better understanding of primitive cultures and small scale societies
- To rule them better, they needed to understand people and their culture

**Sociology:**

- Emerged due to **modernization of Europe itself**
- To understand its own problems and find solutions to its own issues
- Changes brought about due to French and Industrial Revolutions during 18th and 19th centuries

### Areas of Convergence - Sister Disciplines

**1. Common Subject Matter**

- Both study **society and culture**
- Both focused on study of social groups or human communities

**2. Methodological Exchange**

- Many sociologists rely upon qualitative methods developed by anthropologists
- Participant observation used by sociologists to study small groups like criminal gangs

**3. Modern Convergence**

- No society literally worldwide has remained untouched by forces of industrialization
- Both disciplines study impact of industrialization on tribal communities
- Many universities have combined departments of sociology and anthropology
- Many scholars like **M.N. SRINIVAS** are considered both sociologists and anthropologists

**4. Contemporary Societies**

- Modernizing societies (like India) retain several characteristics of pre-modern society while becoming large scale
- Large scale like modern society but dependent on agriculture, birth-based criteria, kinship playing important role like pre-modern societies

## Sociology and Psychology (88:14)

### Fundamental Differences

| Aspect           | Psychology                           | Sociology               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Focus            | Study of human mind and behavior     | Study of society        |

| System Type      | Study of mental systems              | Study of social systems |
| Subject Matter   | Individual behavior, animal behavior | Social phenomena        |

### Historical Distinction

- **DURKHEIM**: Social facts are clearly distinct from psychological facts
- His study of **suicide** proved that what was typically regarded as psychological phenomena is really a social phenomena
- He demonstrated that what was typically considered as psychological phenomena is really social phenomena
- Rejected psychological explanations of suicide and highlighted social factors: **social integration and moral regulation**

### Areas of Convergence

**1. Weber's Contribution**

- **WEBER's** writings brought sociology closer to psychology for first time
- **Verstehen method**: Researcher has to interpret subjective meaning attached by actor to his actions

**2. G.H. MEAD**

- **"The Self is a social construct"** according to MEAD

**3. Phenomenology and Ethnomethodology**

- Seek to understand how people think, how they create their social world

**4. Karl Marx's Alienation Theory**

- Alienation is societal condition but affects worker psychology
- Explores psychological state of workers because of prevailing social conditions

**5. Crowd Psychology**

- **LE BON** wrote "The Crowd" - crowd psychology
- How people think and behave differently even in groups

## Sociology and Political Science (96:44)

### Core Differences

| Aspect      | Political Science                                   | Sociology                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focus       | Study of political system exclusively               | Study of polity as one of many social institutions        |
| Scope       | Domain of power and politics                        | Various social institutions                               |
| Approach    | Formal aspects - structures, procedures             | Actual workings of government                             |
| Perspective | State as overarching arrangement containing society | Society as overarching entity containing state and polity |

### Methodological Differences

**Political Science:**

- More focused on **formal aspects**
- Analyzing formal aspects of government (structures, procedures)
- How bills are passed, stages of legislation, executive organization

**Sociology:**

- More interested in **actual workings** of government
- Actual working of political system, not just formal aspects
- Role of pressure groups, actual political processes

### Historical Convergence

**1. Common Roots**

- Both trace roots in **ancient Greek philosophy**
- Scholars like **PLATO and ARISTOTLE** analyzed nature of state and society
- Their writings were beginnings of inquiry in both disciplines

**2. Shared Theories**

- Several theories of power and politics are common to both disciplines
- **WEBER**: Bureaucracy, political parties, different types of authority
- **Elite theories**: Modern and classical elite theories appear in both

**3. 20th Century Transformation**

- Nature of state transformed from **police state to welfare state**
- **Police State**: Primarily concerned with maintenance of law and order and revenue collection
- **Welfare State**: Functions expanded greatly - education, healthcare, minimizing inequalities
- With development of welfare state, engagement of state with society has increased
- Consequently bringing the two disciplines closer

### Examples of Convergence

- Analysis of impact of government schemes on society interests both disciplines
- Study of political participation and representation

## Sociology and Economics (108:04)

### Basic Definitions

**Economics:** Study of production, distribution and consumption of goods and services

**Sociology:** Studies economy as one of many social institutions

### Fundamental Differences

| Aspect      | Economics                                                                          | Sociology                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Focus       | Relationship between economic variables (demand, supply, price, GDP, unemployment) | How social factors impact economic behavior                  |
| Human Model | **Homo Economicus** - fully rational being driven by benefit maximization          | Recognizes economic behavior driven by various other factors |
| Approach    | Views economy almost in isolation                                                  | Acknowledges economy as part of wider society                |
| Analysis    | Pure economic logic and rationality                                                | Social correlates of economic behavior                       |

### Economic vs Sociological Analysis

**Example: Purchasing Decision**

- **Economic Logic**: Buy from cheaper source for benefit maximization
- **Sociological Factors**: 
  - May buy from sister to help family
  - Religious considerations (boycott based on community)
  - Caste considerations (same caste preference)
  - Social and political reasons influence economic decisions

### Sociological Critique of Economics

**1. Gendered Analysis**

- **Feminist sociologists** criticize economics for ignoring immense amounts of work done by women inside homes
- Housework, domestic chores, baby care, elderly care often ignored in economic analysis

**2. Embedded Economy**

- Economics often ignores and focuses mainly on economic variables
- Sociology recognizes how economy is **embedded in wider society**
- Connected with various other social institutions: religion, caste system, family, kinship, political system

### Historical Examples of Different Approaches

**Division of Labor:**

- **ADAM SMITH**: Division of labor results in increased production efficiency
- **DURKHEIM**: Complex division of labor had wider societal impact, resulted in organic solidarity

### Areas of Convergence

**1. Marxist Framework**

- **MARX**: Economy is the base upon which whole edifice of society is built (superstructure)
- Various social institutions (family, religion) are shaped by economic base
- Changes in society result from changes in economy
- In Marxist writings, economics and sociology converge

**2. Expanding Scope of Economics**

- Economics has broadened its scope to include study of previously neglected phenomena
- Social inequality, human development, not just economic growth
- Gender budgeting, behavioral economics
- How various non-rational, non-economic factors affect economic behavior

## Scope of Sociology (121:53)

### Two Schools of Thought

**1. Specialist School of Thought**

- According to specialist school, sociology has a **narrow scope**
- Sociology is a **specific science**
- Scholars: **SIMMEL, TONNIES, WEBER**
- Sociology is a **pure and independent social science**

**2. Synthetic School of Thought**  

- According to synthetic school, scope of sociology is **very vast**
- Called synthetic because it is a **synthesis of various social sciences**
- Covers almost everything about human behavior and social life
- Scholars: **SOROKIN, HOBHOUSE**
- Sociology is a **general science**
- It is interconnected with other social sciences

### Definitional Approaches by Scholars

**According to WEBER:**

- Sociology is the study of **social action**
- Interpretative understanding of social action

**According to DURKHEIM:**

- Sociology is the study of **social facts**

**According to COMTE:**

- Sociology is the study of **social statics and social dynamics**
- Things which remain (how things continue in society) and how things change

## Discussion of 2023 Exam Questions (142:22)

### Selected Questions Analysis

**1. Distinctiveness of Feminist Method of Social Research**

- Feminist research methodology is very distinctive from conventional research methodologies
- Conventional: Focus on objectivity, scientific method, detached approach to research subjects
- Feminist: Advocates very close and intimate relationship between researcher and research subjects, collaborative approach

**2. Relationship between Sociology and Political Science**

- Already discussed comprehensively

**3. Dramaturgical Perspective (Goffman)**

- **IRVING GOFFMAN**: "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life"
- Compares social life to theater
- Various members of society are like actors on stage performing in front of audience
- While performing various roles, they are acting various characters
- They must look the part - use various props, appropriate language
- **Front stage vs Back stage behavior**
- Engage in **impression management** - try to convey positive image by concealing certain aspects and hiding others

**4. Reference Group Theory - Universal Applicability**

- **Not universally applicable** despite very wide application
- Has very wide application in various social contexts
- **MERTON** was against grand theorizing
- It's a **middle range concept** with wide application, not universal applicability

### Iron Law of Oligarchy - Robert Michels (150:10)

**Background:**

- **ROBERT MICHELS**: Elite theorist, same category as PARETO and MOSCA
- Book: "Political Parties"
- Originally a socialist, disillusioned with Socialist Democratic Party

**The Iron Law:**

- **"Organization says oligarchy"**
- All organizations eventually develop into oligarchy
- In large groups and complex organizations, real democracy is nearly impossible
- Even if organization established on democratic principles, eventually develops oligarchic tendencies
- **Representative democracy is a facade** which hides and legitimizes rule of elites

**Reasons for Oligarchy:**

1. **People's Disinterest**: General public quite laid back and disinterested in day-to-day political affairs
2. **Practical Constraints**: Everybody can't participate in large scale organization
3. **Leadership Control**: Leaders control information flow, official communication, can dispense patronage
4. **Centralization**: Those at top centralize power by controlling flow of information and due to indifference and non-participation by ordinary members

### Lions and Foxes (Pareto's Theory) (163:16)

**Differences:**

- **Lions**: Ruthless, use force, aggressive, assertive, decisive, conservative
- **Foxes**: Cunning, manipulative, use deception

**Similarities:**

- Both are part of ruling class
- Both possess qualities absent in masses
- Both lack qualities of the other
- Neither can stay in power perpetually
- Both are complementary to each other - both qualities needed for rule

**Circulation of Elites:** One type replaced by another due to these differences

## Post-Modernism (192:02)

### Context and Background

**The Question:** "Does collapse of functionalism and bankruptcy of Marxism coincide with the rupture of modernity?"

**Modern Theories:**

- **COMTE, SPENCER, DURKHEIM, PARSONS, MARX, ENGELS, WEBER** - all modern theories
- Developed to explain **modern society**
- Modern society emerged in aftermath of **French and Industrial Revolutions**
- Based on principles of **Enlightenment**
- Saw birth of modern society as **progressive development**
- Believed in notion of **progress**

### Characteristics of Modern Theories

**1. Comprehensive Framework Claims**

- Claimed to provide comprehensive and definitive theory of society
- Claimed to discover objective truth about society

**2. Influenced by Enlightenment**

- Influenced by ideals of Enlightenment: rationality, scientific approach
- Explained modern society which emerged in context of French and Industrial Revolutions

**3. Progress Orientation**

- Believed in notion of progress
- Built very comprehensive frameworks explaining totality of social relations

### The Rupture - Emergence of Post-Modernity

**Timeline:** Middle of 20th century, clearly after 1950s (some argue 1980s-90s)

**Post-Modern Society Characteristics:**

- Western world entered new phase: **post-modernity**
- What we discussed as **post-industrial society**
- Dominated by service sector, globalization

### Post-Modern Theory Principles

**1. Rejection of Enlightenment Values**

- Post-modernism **rejects values of Enlightenment**
- **LYOTARD, BAUDRILLARD** are key post-modern theorists

**2. Abandonment of Enlightenment Project**

- The Enlightenment project has been abandoned in contemporary societies
- People are pessimistic about future
- Unlikely to believe claims of grand theories like Marxism

**3. Diversity of Views**

- Much wider variety of views and beliefs in post-modern societies
- People unwilling to accept that any one set of ideas tells absolute truth
- Post-modernists see these developments as welcome changes

### Key Post-Modern Concepts

**4. Disbelief in Meta-Narratives (Lyotard)**

- **LYOTARD** suggests post-modern culture began to develop by end of 1950s
- Encourages **disbelief in meta-narratives**
- Search for truth is abandoned
- Diversity of beliefs is embraced

**5. Simulacra (Baudrillard)**

- **BAUDRILLARD**: Post-modern world characterized by free exchange of images and words
- **Blurring of differences between real and unreal/imaginary**
- Development of **simulacra** - imaginary exists in real world and real exists in imaginary
- **Examples**: Theme parks like Disneyland, cities like Los Angeles

**6. Media Influence**

- **Mass media, especially TV**, led to development of post-modern world
- "**TV watches us**" - TV alienates, informs, manipulates us
- Unable to distinguish between images and reality
- **"Dissolution of life in TV"**

### Decline of Modern Theories

**Functionalism:**

- Got discredited due to over-emphasis on cooperation and harmony
- Seemed very status quo-ist, conservative in orientation

**Marxism:**

- Got discredited due to **fall of communism**
- Fall of Soviet bloc and Berlin Wall discredited Marxism as theoretical framework

**Timeline Convergence:**

- All three happened around same time period (1950-1980)
- Functionalism dominant till 1950-60, then went out of fashion
- Marxism discredited with fall of Berlin Wall
- Society transitioned from modern to post-modern society in West
