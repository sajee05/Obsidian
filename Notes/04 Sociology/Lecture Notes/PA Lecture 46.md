## THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON TECHNOLOGY IMPACT (85:36)

### Three Broad Views on Technology Impact

#### 1. Technological Optimism (87:24)

- **Core Belief**: The impact of technology on human society is largely positive

- **Justifications**:
  
  - Technology has made our lives far more comfortable
  - Increased efficiency and facilitated communication
  - Reduced burden of work
  - Thanks to advances in medical technology, human life spans have increased significantly
  - Mortality rates and infant mortality rates have come down significantly
  - We are living longer, healthier and more comfortable lives

- **Historical Comparison**: 
  
  - People today have better quality of life than AKBAR THE GREAT
  - AKBAR did not have electricity, tubelight, bulb, fan, All Out mosquito repellent
  - For travel from here to Agra, he would go on elephant back spending many uncomfortable hours
  - We can travel in Shatabdi train for ₹500 in less than half the time with twice more comfort
  - AKBAR did not have flush toilets

- **Democratization of Comfort**: 
  
  - Technology has made it not just an elite thing
  - The ordinary guy has access to such kinds of comforts
  - AKBAR did not have WhatsApp, today even rickshaw puller has it
  - We are living vastly better lives largely for the better by accident of the times we have been born in

#### 2. Technological Pessimism (92:03)

- **Core Belief**: Technology has had an impact on human societies, but its impact has been largely negative

- **Destructive Capabilities**:
  
  - Due to technology, mankind now witnesses large scale destruction unprecedented in human history
  - Due to military technologies, complete annihilation of cities like HIROSHIMA and NAGASAKI is possible

- **Alienation of Man**:
  
  - Technological progress has resulted in alienation of man from work
  - Technology has taken away any skill, initiative, creativity required to perform our tasks
  - Man has been reduced to an appendage of the machine
  - We have all become robots ourselves

- **Disconnection from Nature**:
  
  - Technology has taken us away from the lap of Mother Nature
  - We live in very artificially constructed environments, not in natural environment
  - Unlike almost all other species which flourish in nature
  - Our circadian clock has been disrupted - we no longer sleep with setting of sun and wake with rising of sun
  - We consume blue light from phones and televisions late at night

- **Social Isolation**:
  
  - Technology has separated man from fellow man
  - Even when with friends and family, people are glued to mobile phones
  - It is erecting walls between people and transforming nature of human social interaction
  - People take offense if you don't reply to messages promptly

- **New Problems Created**:
  
  - Technology has resulted in birth of new diseases (possibly COVID was created in Chinese lab in Wuhan)
  - Greater surveillance - never disconnected from work, always at beck and call of employer and boss
  - Intrusion in people's privacy

  - What should be nature of relationship between surrogate mother and child born out of surrogacy?

#### 3. Technological Neutrality (101:16)

- **Core Principle**: Technology in itself is neither good nor bad

- **Human Agency**: 
  
  - Technology is a facility in human hands
  - Whether its effects are good or bad depends on what use it is put to by human beings
  - Same technology can be put to either productive uses or destructive ones

- **Examples**:
  
  - Nuclear technology: Can generate electricity or create atom bombs
  - Internet: Can explore infinite world of knowledge and information OR access dark web for drugs, human trafficking

## SCHOLARLY PERSPECTIVES ON TECHNOLOGY (103:07)

### KARL MARX on Technology

- **Technological Progress as Positive**: Advancement is good as it indicates man has been able to better control nature
- **Increased Productivity**: Technological change has resulted in increased productivity - all good from Marxist viewpoint
- **Alienation Concern**: But improvements in technology also result in increase in alienation

### WEBER on Science and Technology

- **Modernization Process**: With modernization comes rationalization and disenchantment
- **Reason as Guiding Force**: Reason becomes the guiding force for human and social action
- **Driven by Logic**: People are more driven by reason, logic, calculability

## CULTURAL LAG THEORY (108:00)

### W.F. OGBURN's Cultural Lag Concept

- **Source**: According to WILLIAM F. OGBURN in his book "Social Change with Respect to Culture and Original Nature"
- **Definition**: The term cultural lag indicates the gap between changes in material culture and those in non-material culture

#### Two Parts of Culture

| Material Culture                       | Non-Material Culture                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Physical objects, things, technologies | Norms, values, ways of thinking prevalent in society |
| Changes at fast pace                   | Changes slowly                                       |

#### Cultural Lag Process

- **Speed Difference**: Material culture changes at faster pace than non-material culture

- **Catching Up**: Non-material culture has to play catch up

- **Maladjustment Period**: During the period when non-material culture has not yet been able to keep pace with changes in material culture, cultural lag results

- **Consequences**: 
  
  - Maladjustment between different parts of culture
  - Since societal norms and people's mindset take time to catch up with technological developments, cultural lag results
  - Such cultural lag may lead to social problems and lack of synchronization between two parts of culture

#### Examples of Cultural Lag

**Contraceptive Technology Example**:

- Contraceptive technology has been around for good amount of time
- Condoms are most easy to use contraceptive method
- But condom usage is abysmal low
- Not due to lack of awareness - people know about contraception
- Due to mentality - many Indian men take it as affront to their masculinity
- Available technology not being fully adopted, resulting in social problems like population explosion and high fertility rate

**Vaccine Hesitancy Example**:

- During pandemic, vaccines were developed
- But there was initial period of vaccine hesitancy
- People were reluctant to get vaccine shots
- This indicates cultural lag

**Online Education Example**:

- Online education is very real possibility
- Many students opt for online education
- But several still have old mindset that studying happens in classroom face-to-face
- May cost 10 times more with boarding and lodging expenses and lot of hassle
- Yet people opt for classroom education instead of online education
- This is cultural lag

## MASS MEDIA (131:03)

### Definition and Components
