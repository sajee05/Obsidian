# Criticism of Marxist Theory - Lecture Notes

## Quick Recap of Previous Class (17:12)

- **Class Struggle**: All existing society historical epochs have passed in the history of class
- Every society from ancient slave society to feudal society to capitalist society to communist society passes on changes because of the class struggle between the haves and have nots
- In case of ancient slave society the haves were the masters and the have nots were the slaves
- There's a fundamental conflict of interest because of which there is a continuous class struggle sometimes hidden sometimes overt between the two main classes
- **Negation of Negation**: Like one class ends and gives rise to another
- **New Productive Forces**: New productive forces started in the framework of the old. New productive forces start taking shape within the framework of the old society
- There comes due to technological progress a point that it is not able to further progress in the same framework
- The old relations of production start serving as a hindrance to the further development of the new productive forces
- It is at this point that a class struggle starts taking place between the ruling class and the emerging class
- The emerging class also mobilizes the support of the have nots against the ruling class

### From Capitalism to Communism

- There always exists a contradiction between the two classes
- These differences are irreconcilable - they cannot be reconciled
- Certain social processes result in class polarization in capitalist society such as deskilling and the consequent homogenization of the workforce
- **Polarization of the Proletariat**: The petit bourgeoisie will sink into the working class
- More and more workers start getting concentrated in larger factories

### Class Consciousness

- **Class in Itself**: Workers do not have consciousness that there are differences between them. They don't have the awareness or the consciousness that they all belong to the same class
- **False Class Consciousness**: Workers have incorrect understanding of their class position
- When class polarization takes place, false class consciousness is replaced by true class consciousness
- Workers transform from a class in itself to class for itself
- They realize that they belong to the same class having the same class interest and they identify the common class enemy and take collective action against the class enemy

### Nature of Communist Society

- **Classless Society** with advanced technology
- No division of labor, no deskilling
- Everybody can do whatever they want like hunting in the morning
- No religion, no concept of state, no money, no property, no alienation
- **Stateless** society
- **From each according to his ability to each according to his needs**
- People start working for the innate satisfaction that work brings rather than being driven by external rewards
- No narrow occupational categories being confined to
- No further change

### Dictatorship of the Proletariat

- An intervening stage between capitalism and communism
- The state apparatus and the means of production are controlled by some members of the proletariat on behalf of the whole of the society
- Purpose: To remove the last vestiges of capitalism

## Student Criticisms of Marx (30:24)

### Utopian Nature

- **It's a utopian idea**: Too idealistic, too perfect to be practicable
- Marx romanticized the transition to communism

### Historical Development Issues

- **Eastern Block Countries**: Many jumped from feudalism to dictatorship of the proletariat without going through industrial capitalist development
- The eastern block countries during the cold war were in the nature of dictatorships of the proletariat, not communism proper
- They jumped without having gone through industrial capitalist development

### Economic Determinism

- **Marx ignores greed**: Greed is what drives everything that people do, and Marx completely ignores this
- Marx was very single-minded - he saw everything through the economic lens and downplayed the importance of various other factors in social life

### Practical Impossibility

- A completely egalitarian society is practically impossible
- Even if you don't have differences in wealth you will have differences in some other parameters such as maybe bodily strength
- **Capitalism rewards**: Hard work, better performance, merit
- It provides room for growth of the individual

### Violence and Conflict

- Marx provides a moral justification for violence
- Once you do that, women will pick up arms to fight patriarchy, tribals will pick up arms to fight their exclusion from the wider society

### Motivation and Work

- **People will become lethargic**: They won't be hardworking as there will be no concept of money
- There will be no motivation
- If many people are interested in a particular occupation in communist society, then how will the other societal needs be fulfilled?

### Innovation and Competition

- Due to egalitarian nature, competition is less, which leads to no innovation taking place
- Advancement in technology is less

### Other Criticisms from Students

- **Marx did not go anywhere**: Just sat at one place and made a theory
- Communism came out as an antithesis to capitalism but never had its independent existence
- Marx's ideas revolve mostly around the economy and he ignores other social and cultural aspects
- **Marx ignores the middle class**: Society getting clearly polarized into haves and have nots, but the middle class has expanded in western societies
- **Marx ignored the female population**: He literally ignores the plight of half of the world's population

## Cold War Context (32:48)

### Basic Division

- After the second world war, the world was broadly divided into two competing blocks
- **Western Block**: Led by USA as the guiding superpower, capitalist in orientation in terms of economic structure, liberal democracies in terms of politics
- **Eastern Block**: Led by USSR or Soviet Russia, subscribed to communist ideology, lot of state control in economies, governed by single party mechanism

### Cold War Period

- Period of around four five decades of cold war till about 1990
- The world was always on tenterhooks
- USA and USSR were nuclear capable powers with lot of stockpiling
- Lot of tensions, skirmishes etc. but did not result in full-fledged hot war
- Both superpowers were trying to widen their sphere of influence

### Military Alliances

- **NATO**: USA had western European countries like France, Germany
- **Warsaw Pact**: USSR led this with Eastern European countries like Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia
- **Non-Aligned Movement**: India and several other countries were not formally aligned to either block

### End of Cold War

- **1990-91 period**: Period of lot of turmoil globally
- **Berlin Wall**: Coming down marked end of communism symbolically. Wall divided eastern Germany and western Germany
- **USSR Disintegration**: 1991 or '92, leaving behind 15 independent states
- This marked the defeat of communism and victory of capitalism
- **Economic Reforms in India**: 1991-92 period, decisive turn towards integration into global capitalism

## Criticisms of Marxist Theory (51:41)

### 1. Economic Determinism (51:55)

- **Most oft repeated criticism**: Marx is accused of economic determinism or economic reductionism
- He sees the economy as the determining force
- He reduces everything to economic factors
- **His theory overemphasizes upon the economy** as the driving force of social change
- His whole theory is basically an economic theory downplaying the importance of various other aspects of social life
- Economy is the base which shapes the various other aspects of the society

#### Counter-Perspective

- Critics argue it's not just that economy shapes other aspects of social life but even the other way around
- **WEBER**: Highlighted how religious beliefs of the Protestant Christians led to the development of the capitalist economic system
- MARX: Religion, family, everything is shaped by the economy
- WEBER: Religious beliefs of Protestant Christians were the cause that led to the development of capitalism

### 2. Universal Application Claims (55:06)

- **MARX claims his theory is universal**: These are the stages of social evolution that all societies pass through
- These claims of universal application have been questioned by critics
- **Not all societies may pass through the same set of stages**
- Example: A country like China changed from feudal stage to a dictatorship of the proletariat kind of stage
- Not all societies may follow the stages as envisaged by KARL MARX in his theory of historical materialism or social change

### 3. Wrong Assessment of Human Nature (56:21)

- **MARX basically assessed human nature wrongly**: He was naive in his assessment of human nature
- **Man by nature is acquisitive**: We love to acquire
- Example with small children: You give a small child anything, you give them a pencil and then you try to take it back - you can't. This tells us how man by nature has that acquisitive instinct
- They have not been socialized or taught by society yet they have that acquisitive instinct

### 4. Class-Only Focus (58:24)

- **He only focuses on class as a relevant category**
- His whole analysis is class analysis ignoring other basis of human grouping or other divisions in society
- **In Indian society, caste may be a division as important as class**
- Some would say caste consciousness is stronger in India than class consciousness
- As a Brahman, I would identify strongly with fellow Brahmans more than those who share a similar class situation as I do
- **Gender**: Feminist scholars have highlighted he ignores gender as a basis of division in society
- Gender-based division, gender-based exploitation is far more fundamental to society than class-based divisions and conflicts and oppression

### 5. Not Scientific (60:44)

- **MARX and ENGELS claim their theory is scientific** and these claims are hotly contested
- Critics alleged that his theory is anything but scientific or it is not at all scientific

#### Why Not Scientific:

**a) Narrow Empirical Basis (61:13)**

- The empirical basis of his theory is very narrow
- He'll pluck stray data or whatever which support his broad framework

**b) Lack of Objectivity (61:48)**

- One hallmark of scientific approach which is objectivity is clearly missing in MARXIST writings
- His is not an objective analysis of society
- This is not a detached scientific objective analysis of society
- His writings clearly reveal where his heart lies
- **Value-laden language**: He says the bourgeoisie are blood sucking vampires
- He calls them oppressors, exploiters, leeches, compares them to leeches
- This is really not the language of an objective scientific analysis

**c) Political Agenda (63:08)**

- **MARX had a clear political agenda**
- He was not this detached scientific observer and analyst of social life
- **His political agenda**: To root out capitalism globally, overthrow capitalism and in its place establish a worldwide communist movement and governments

### 6. Ignores Harmony and Integration (64:09)

- **MARX ignores harmony, integration** which is also a part of social life
- He overemphasizes on conflict and turns a blind eye to harmony present in society
- He downplays the harmony prevalent in social life, overemphasizes on conflict and oppression and exploitation
- **Why should the interests of the haves and have nots be irreconcilable?**
- Why must I cut down on workers wages if I'm a capitalist to increase my profits?
- Can't I increase my profits through other ways? Perhaps increasing production efficiency, not necessarily cutting down wages, raw material cost, wastage

#### FREDERICK TAYLOR's Counter-Theory

- **FREDERICK TAYLOR**: Talked about how workers and management should put their differences aside and cooperate
- **Scientific Management Theory**: Cooperation between workers and management will lead to peace and harmony
- Both will benefit - it doesn't have to be one winning at the cost of the other
- It can be a win-win situation
- **HENRY FORD**: Applied Taylorism very successfully
- Management will benefit in terms of higher profits, workers will benefit in terms of higher take-home packets or wages
- Customers can also benefit from lower prices through increased efficiency

### 7. Individual as Unimportant (67:44)

- **MARX considers the individual as unimportant**
- According to MARX, the individual is controlled by the historical forces or the wider social conditions, particularly economic conditions
- The individual according to MARX is controlled by historical forces and social conditions, particularly economic forces

#### Counter-Argument

- **Critics starting from WEBER** contend that the individual can have volition, can have agency
- He's not merely a puppet responding to societal forces
- Critics argue that the individual is not a puppet in the hands of the society the way MARXISM suggests

### 8. Ignores Power of Ideas (69:48)

- **MARX ignores the power of ideas**
- **HEGEL**: Suggests that ideas play a very decisive role in shaping human history
- HEGEL highlighted how ideas play a very decisive role in shaping human history

#### Irony

- **Best example**: MARX himself - irony of ironies
- MARX's ideas have had a profound influence on the development of the course of human history

### 9. Wrong Predictions About Working Class (71:35)

- **MARX**: The working class will become homogeneous as capitalism advances
- **Question**: Has working class become more homogeneous or more heterogeneous in advanced capitalism?
- **Answer**: Possibly more heterogeneous

#### RALPH DAHRENDORF's Analysis

- **RALPH DAHRENDORF**: Says that decomposition of labor has taken place in advanced capitalism
- The labor has become more or the working class have become more heterogeneous
- **Skilled workers, semi-skilled workers, unskilled workers** today constitute three distinct classes
- They don't see eye to eye at all. Their class interests diverge
- Precisely the opposite of what MARX had suggested

### 10. Wrong Predictions About Future (74:18)

- **MARX was wrong in his predictions** regarding the future course of social evolution
- He wrongly predicted the future of society

#### Specific Wrong Predictions:

- **Capitalism will collapse**: Has it? No. Capitalism in fact is flourishing even today
- **Bloody proletariat revolution**: Has that taken place? Even in western advanced economies, capitalist economies, it hasn't. There are no signs of a proletariat revolution

#### Current Reality of Working Class

- MARX wrote of the proletariat with a bleeding heart, talking about how exploited and oppressed they were
- **Today many contend that the working class have a stake in the perpetuation of capitalism**
- They are the beneficiaries of capitalism. So they would want capitalism to stay and not go away
- Many members of the working class have also reaped the benefits of capitalism particularly in terms of higher standards of living
- **Working class people today have a far better life** in the western capitalist economies than they did earlier
- They have developed a vested stake in capitalism rather than being the enemies of capitalism

#### Modern Working Class Benefits:

- Higher standards of living
- Limited work hours
- Trade unions to protect their interests
- Welfare provisions
- Minimum wage legislation
- Workers today are a comfortable lot, not the exploited and oppressed lot that MARX was writing about

### 11. Historical Collapse of Communist States (78:21)

- **The biggest obvious defeat of MARXIST theory**: MARXISM where it was tried failed
- **World historic collapse of the Eastern block including Soviet Russia**
- The fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern block proves that MARX's theory does not provide an appropriate framework to organize the social and economic lives of a people
- The demise of Soviet Russia and the whole of Eastern block communist countries proves that MARXISM was wrong

#### Why Did Eastern Block Fall?

**Economic Reasons:**

- **It was economically unsustainable**
- There was no driving force, no motivation to produce
- If everybody's needs are being fulfilled by the society whether I produce five shirts or 50 shirts, why will I produce 50 shirts?
- **Absence of competition** which prevails in a free market economy
- **Absence of profit** which serves as an incentive in a free market economy
- There was no driving force for striving for greater production or improved or any sort of innovations

**Political Reasons:**

- The Soviet block or eastern block countries suppressed any sort of dissent
- They denied basic freedoms to the people
- People did not have any alternatives or choice which a democratic polity affords its citizens
- **All power was concentrated in one body** which was the ruling party

#### Power Distribution Comparison:

| Western Democratic Countries                     | Eastern Block Countries                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Economic power concentrated in big corporates    | All power concentrated in ruling party      |
| Political power with government functionaries    | No opposition parties allowed               |
| Media has important role                         | Media controlled by state                   |
| Civil society organizations check abuse of power | No dissenting voices allowed                |
| Trade unions secure workers interests            | Education system controlled by state        |
| Power is distributed                             | Economic infrastructure controlled by state |

- **Those who manned the state apparatus enjoyed unquestioned unbridled power**
- Some scholars have suggested that there was a **new class which emerged in the eastern block which was more exploitative than the bourgeoisie in the west**

#### FRANCIS FUKUYAMA - End of History

- **FRANCIS FUKUYAMA**: Wrote about the end of history
- In MARXIST theory, when does history end? With the establishment of communist society
- **FUKUYAMA**: The world historic collapse of Soviet Russia and the victory of liberal democratic political framework and capitalist economic framework marks the end of history
- The decisive victory of liberal democracies and capitalism over communist ideology means a final resolution of the conflict between the two

#### RAYMOND ARON's Critique

- **RAYMOND ARON**: Title of his work is "MARXISM is the opium of the intellectuals"
- MARX: Religion is the opium of the masses
- In turn: MARXISM is the opium of the intellectuals
- Just like MARX criticized religion as an opiate that dulls your thinking capacity, it is actually MARXISM which does it
- MARXISM is rigid. Intellectuals who support MARXISM gloss over, ignore the various injustices, even killings of millions which have been done in the name of MARXISM
- **STALIN in Russia** killed scores of people - 60 million
- It is MARXISM where you have curtailment of basic freedoms, people's rights being taken away
- MARXIST intellectuals support something which is very indefensible

## In Defense of KARL MARX (94:07)

### Continued Relevance and Impact

- **MARX continues to be regarded as one of the foremost thinkers of the modern age**
- MARXIST writings have had a very profound impact on the evolution of society
- A very profound impact on the lived experiences of millions of people across the globe
- You cannot be dismissive of KARL MARX
- **He is regarded even today amongst the three most influential or impactful human beings to have ever lived on this earth**
- MARXISM became the basis for organizing the socio-political lives of millions of people for several decades during the cold war period

### Crisis and Remembrance

- **Whenever global capitalism faces a crisis even till date who is remembered? KARL MARX**
- The last major crisis to hit global capitalism was the US financial and subprime crisis 2008
- It ignited a debate, articles after articles: Was MARX right?
- **MARX was placed on the cover of Time magazine** - a poster boy of Western capitalism

### Self-Defeating Prophecy

- **R.K. MERTON**: Suggests that MARXISM is a self-defeating prophecy
- **Self-fulfilling prophecy**: Something comes true because it was predicted
- **Self-defeating prophecy**: Something did not come true because it was predicted
- MARXISM did not come true. What he predicted? MARXIST predictions did not come true because he predicted
- **Through his extensive writings highlighted the shortcomings of capitalism**, the contradictions in capitalism, the instability of capitalism
- So the capitalist societies took corrective measures
- **From exploitative capitalism it transformed into welfare capitalism**
- Started taking care of the working class and because of that the revolution did not take place
- In the process there was a lot of improvement in or transformation of the nature of capitalism itself
- **Capitalism which was very exploitative in MARXIST times became far more accommodative of working class interests**

### Academic and Intellectual Impact

#### In Sociology

- **In the academic discipline of sociology MARXIST sociology offers a much needed critique to functional sociology**
- It provides a balance
- Functionalists overemphasize on cooperation, harmony, integration, consensus, coordination
- **MARXISM highlights conflict and oppression** prevalent in social life which was ignored or downplayed in functional analysis

#### In Academia

- **In Indian academia there is a strong leftist bias**
- JNU is the hub of intellectual activity in the country and has a strong leftist bias
- Modi government with all its Hindutva leanings has not been able to affect it one bit
- The education minister stated publicly: "I have not changed a comma in any of the textbooks" - Prakash Javadekar under the Modi regime

#### In Movements

- **Various movements of disprivileged sections of the society** across the globe seek inspiration from the writings of MARX
- **Naxalite movement in India**
- Other peasant uprisings in Latin America
- Some strands of women's movements are profoundly influenced by MARXISM
- **Trade union movement** continues to be inspired from MARXIST writings
- **Leftist political parties** across the globe whose politics is influenced by MARXISM
- In India: They have ruled for long years in Kerala, in Bengal, in Tripura, were part of center during united front governments

### Responses to Common Criticisms

#### Economic Determinism Defense

- **Many criticisms stem from incomplete understanding** of his extensive writings
- Example: MARX very often is accused of economic determinism
- That is a very incomplete understanding of MARXISM
- **MARX says that superstructure is shaped by the base in the last instance**
- Meaning eventually or ultimately it is the economy which shapes the superstructure
- **He acknowledges that elements of the superstructure also have an impact on the economy**
- He acknowledges the impact both ways but eventually it is the economy which prevails
- He does not negate the fact that economy is also affected by elements of the superstructure

#### Individual Agency Defense

- Another accusation: He does not give any importance to the individual
- **MARX says: "History is the activities of men in pursuit of their ends"**
- So he does not see individuals as passive entities controlled by societal forces or economic forces
- **MARX's tombstone**: "Workers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains"
- It is a rousing call to action
- This is not a person who does not attribute any agency to the individual
- **He does in places attribute agency** and consider individuals as playing important role in the shaping of human history

### Contemporary Relevance

#### Wealth Concentration

- **MARX talked about increasing concentration of wealth** with the advancement of capitalism
- That wealth will get concentrated in fewer and fewer hands
- **OXFAM report of 2018**: 26 richest people in the world have the same amount of wealth as the poorest 3.8 billion people which is half of the world's population

#### Alienation

- **The concept of alienation still resonates** with a lot of people
- The nature of work has changed significantly since MARXIST times
- Working hours were 15-17 hours a day in MARXIST times, today typically 8 hour workday, 5 days a week
- Minimum wage legislation, insurance, PF facilities for workers
- **But scholars like HERBERT MARCUSE** have reapplied the concept of alienation in 20th and 21st century

#### Political-Economic Nexus

- **His analysis on the close nexus between political elites and the rich** was bang on the mark
- Very apparent during US financial crisis - government went out of its way to bail out big banks
- **There is a very close and apparent nexus between the political elites and the capitalists**

### Final Assessment

- **MARX may be dead, but MARXISM lives on**
- It lives on in numerous working class movements across the globe
- Various working class movements across the globe continue to seek inspiration from the writings of KARL MARX
- Not only trade union movements but leftist political parties who have significant presence in Indian politics
- Even in academia, various movements of disprivileged sections seek inspiration from MARX

## Previous Year Questions Discussion (134:14)

### Application-Based Questions Strategy

#### General Approach for MERTON Questions

- Questions have two aspects: 
  1. **Theory part**: What you learned in classes
  2. **Application part**: Common sense knowledge about the topic
- **You have to marry the two** in your writings
- Part of answer deals with elaborating the theory (straightforward)
- Then link it to whatever they are applying it to (challenging part)
- **Time management**: Give 1-1.5 minutes to thinking/linking, then start writing
- If you have choice, try not to attempt such questions if others are simpler

#### Reference Group Theory and Fashion Example

**Question**: How can we use reference group theory to understand fashion in society?

**Approach**:

- Begin by explaining what is reference group
- Say MERTON's reference group theory has wide application including fashion in society
- **Use sociological terminologies** associated with that theory

**Content Examples**:

- **Celebrities**: Popular cinema personalities, fashion models are important non-membership reference group
- Large number of people undergo **anticipatory socialization**
- **Peer groups**: Friends, colleagues are membership reference group affecting fashion sense
- **Western societies**: Serve as positive reference group for many in developing countries
- **Traditional revival**: For some, western societies may be negative reference group leading to traditional attire choices
- **Family elders**: Serve as reference groups (example: young girls wearing saris on festivals)
- **Advertising**: Agencies rope in reference groups like cricketers, film stars

#### Manifest and Latent Functions of Corruption Example

**Question**: Using MERTON's concepts of manifest and latent functions, explain persistence of corruption in Indian society.

**Structure**:

1. Highlight that corruption persists despite anti-corruption measures (CVC, RTI, vigilance committees)

2. India ranks 84-86 on transparency international corruption perception index

3. Explain manifest and latent functions definitions

4. **Manifest functions of corruption**:
   
   - Improves purchasing power of corrupt person
   - Speeds up file clearing process for bribe giver
   - Saves compliance costs (environmental clearance example)
   - Monetizing favors

5. **Latent functions of corruption**:
   
   - Generates employment when factories set up
   - Corruption money circulates in economy, stimulates it
   - Invested in real estate sector
   - Government gets quality manpower at subsidized rates
   - Reduces burden on public exchequer

6. **Conclusion**: However corruption also has several manifest and latent dysfunctions

### Other Question Types

#### DURKHEIM Questions

- **"Society is more than sum of individual acts"**: Focus on social facts theory
- **Suicide theory application**: Link farmer suicides, student deaths, terrorism to types of suicide
- **Division of labor relevance**: Discuss hyper-specialization today, but also mention conflicts (Foxconn protests, Maruti plant issues)

#### PARSONS Questions

- **AGIL framework for social problems**: Link naxalism to all four functions or different problems to different functions
- **Pattern variables and social change**: Show shift from traditional to modern orientations
- **Social system theory**: Half page explanation, rest critical analysis
