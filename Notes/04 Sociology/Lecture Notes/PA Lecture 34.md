# SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION: SCIENCE VS RELIGION, SECTS AND CULTS

## SCIENCE VS RELIGION RELATIONSHIP (16:29)

### Recap: Religious Revivalism and Fundamentalism

- **Religious Revivalism**: Also referred to as resecularization. It involves religion as a social force in contemporary times, as rebirth and re-birth of religious as a religion as a social force.

- **Revivalism vs Secularization**: This notion of resecularization or revival is the opposite of secularization. Why? Because secularization means decline in the significance of religion. Revival means once again it is becoming significant.

#### Key Concepts from BERGER and LUCKMANN

- According to LUCKMANN and BERGER, they talk about invisible religion. BERGER and LUCKMANN's concept of invisible religion states that religion is a fundamental inherent concept regarding society.

- **Human Nature**: Man is inherently, innately religious by nature. What has changed from pre-modern to modern era according to them is that religion has become private and invisible, not visible in the public sphere, but people are still praying in the privacy of their homes.

#### Political and Statistical Evidence of Revival

- **Political Reasons**: Political parties are also encouraging sticking to and glorifying the religious identity, particularly they would tend to glorify the identity of the majority community.

- **Statistical Evidence**: 
  
  - HAGIA SOPHIA was built as a church in 6th century, made into a mosque in 15th century
  - The secularization of HAGIA SOPHIA was done by ATATURK regime, and the recent decision to make it into a mosque shows religious revival

#### Technology's Role in Revival

- **Technology**: Modern technology ensures easier, greater, cheaper accessibility of religion whether it is sermons and pilgrimage, etc.

- According to SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, civilizations are characterized by religions. His argument was that after the Cold War and fall of the Soviet Union, there was a vacuum filled by religion, which will lead to conflicts with other civilizations when they will be coming together as a result of globalization and urbanization.

#### Religious Fundamentalism

- **Definition**: Fundamentalists are those people who believe in literally following what's written in the text. They don't want any change in it. No change, no interpretation. What is written should be literally followed.

- **Scholarly Analysis by STEVE BRUCE**:
  
  - Those with single sacred text are more likely to spawn fundamentalist movements
  - The perceived and real external enemy can be a unifying factor to spawn fundamentalism
  - You require potential recruits who come from the lower strata of the society - the disprivileged sections of the society

### The Traditional View: Science vs Religion Dichotomy

- **Traditional Perspective**: Science and religion are viewed as completely different, opposite, conflicting, and incompatible with each other. If science stands for progress, religion stands for status quo. Some would claim it is even regressive. As science progresses, religion tends to decline.

- **Organized Religion vs Scientific Advancement**: Organized religion has often opposed scientific advancements because what science teaches clashes with what is mentioned in the scriptures.

- **Popular View**: The two are very literally poles apart and the twain shall never meet.

### Challenging the Dichotomy: Pre-Modern vs Modern Perspectives

#### Evidence from Ancient Knowledge Systems

- **Vedic Mathematics**: Where would you classify Vedic Mathematics? Is that religion or is that science?

- **Yoga**: Science or religion?

- **Ayurveda**: Is that science or is that a part of religion?

- **The Answer**: Both. What I am trying to suggest friends, now I am moving beyond this science and religion dichotomy, seeing these two as opposites and polar opposites.

#### Historical Integration of Science and Religion

- **Pre-Modern World**: This whole view that religion and science are incompatible and opposites of each other is in fact a view which is shaped by modernity. Only in the modern times, in the modern society, have religion and science been started to be viewed as opposites and incompatible and in conflict with each other.

- **Ancient Integration**: In the pre-modern world, both religion and science were perhaps part of a broader system of knowledge. Both religion and science seek to investigate the nature of reality, both nature and supernatural. Both are systems of knowledge after all.

- **No Clear Distinction**: In the pre-modern world, there was no clear cut distinction between the two.

#### Examples of Religious Scientists

- **Ancient Hindu Rishis**: Many of the ancient Hindu Rishis - were they men of religion or were they also men of science? They were also men of science.

- **Scientific Discoveries**: Numerous scientific discoveries have been attributed to so-called men of religion:
  
  - Discovery of zero
  - Decimal system  
  - SUSHRUTA - considered as the father of surgery and medicine
  - CHARAKA - medicine
  - BHASKARACHARYA - spoke about gravity centuries before NEWTON

#### Architectural Evidence

- You look at ancient temples, look at the rocket architecture of Hindu temples and look at the magnificent Christian cathedrals and medieval era mosques in Europe and Middle East and different parts of the world. Could they have been possible without adequate scientific knowledge?

### Modern Examples of Science-Religion Integration

#### Contemporary Religious Scientists

- **ISRO's Religious Practices**: ISRO has a very long history of, before any major launch, making an offering of a model of the spacecraft to the deity at Tirupati.

- **Nobel Prize Statistics (1901-2000)**:
  
  - 65% of Nobel Prize winners in sciences were Christian
  - 22% were Jewish  
  - Only 5% of Nobel prizes in Physics have been awarded to atheists, agnostics and free thinkers
  - Only 7% of Nobel prizes in Chemistry went to atheists, agnostics and free thinkers
  - Only 9% of Nobel prizes in Medicine went to atheists, agnostics and free thinkers

- **ALAN ECKLUND Study**: Found that 76% of American scientists identified with a religion.

#### Quotes from Renowned Scientists

- **ROBERT BOYLE** (of Boyle's Law): *"God is the author of the universe."*

- **LORD KELVIN** (temperature unit): *"If you study science deep enough and long enough, it will force you to believe in God."*

- **NIKOLA TESLA** (AC current inventor): *"The gift of mental power comes from God, the Divine Being. If we concentrate our minds on the truth, we become in tune with this great power."*

- **CHARLES DARWIN** (Theory of Evolution): *"The question whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the universe has been answered in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that have ever existed."*

- **SRINIVASA RAMANUJAN** (mathematician): *"An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God."* (His mathematical equations came to him through his deity mother in dreams)

- **SIR ISAAC NEWTON**: *"In the absence of any other proof, the thumb alone will convince me of God's existence."* (Referring to the human thumb as a perfect marvel of engineering that could not have simply happened all by chance)

## FOUR MODELS OF SCIENCE-RELIGION RELATIONSHIP

### The Four Models by IAN BARBOUR

According to IAN BARBOUR in his book "When Science Meets Religion" and JOHN POLKINGHORNE in "Science and Theology," they suggest that the relationship between science and religion can be understood using four different models:

#### 1. Conflict Model

- **Definition**: Religion and science are basically incompatible.

- **Proponents**: RICHARD DAWKINS and PETER ATKINS are proponents of the conflict model.

- **DAWKINS' Arguments**:
  
  - If science takes us forward, religion takes us backward
  - If science stimulates our curiosity, religion kills it and discourages it
  - Science basically encourages you to question why, why, why? Religion prevents you from questioning and raising questions

- This is the popular clich√©d and standard way of looking at the relationship between religion and science, but it is a product of modern times.

#### 2. Independence Model

- **Proponent**: STEPHEN JAY GOULD

- **Core Concept**: Science and religion are non-overlapping magisteria - they are basically non-overlapping or mutually exclusive domains of knowledge.

- **Separate Domains**: They deal with separate things:
  
  - Science deals with the natural world - investigation of the natural world
  - Religion deals with the supernatural
  - Science helps us to understand the outside world while religion helps us to deal with the inner world

- **Practical Application**: If I need peace of mind, I would go to religion. If I need high-tech gadgets, I would go to science. Man of religion may not be able to help me to get fancy gadgets, and science may not be able to help me to attain inner peace.

#### 3. Dialogue Model

- **Core Principle**: Both religion and science have immensely contributed to the betterment of mankind, and both have a lot to learn from each other.

- **Requirements for Dialogue**:
  
  - A healthy dialogue needs to be established between religion and science
  - This dialogue must be based on mutual respect
  - Scientists should not look down upon religion, rather they should acknowledge what religion has to offer
  - Likewise, religion and men of religion need to have a healthy respect for the methods of science, the knowledge of science

- **Promoting Organizations**:
  
  - FARADAY INSTITUTE
  - Journals like "Theology and Science"
  - Scholars like ALVIN PLANTINGA

- **Benefits**: Both can assist each other. Both are important for humanity. Both have positively contributed for the betterment of societies. Both can learn from each other and enrich their own body of knowledge.

#### 4. Integration Model

- **Core Philosophy**: The two should be looked at in an integrated fashion rather than being looked at separately. We should look at them and consider them together.

- **Unified Knowledge**: Both are systems of knowledge - whether religious knowledge or scientific knowledge, knowledge is knowledge. Rather than classifying it and looking at it into two separate categories, we should consider them as part of an integrated whole.

- **Historical Precedent**: This is what was there in the pre-modern world - the two were looked at in an integrated fashion.

- **Modern Application**: Both help us to understand the world. Both are sources of knowledge and systems of knowledge. There should be no distinction between the two. Any distinction between religion and science should be done away with, and they should be treated like an integrated whole.

#### Examples of Integration Model

- **MANI BHAUMIK**: Author of "Code Name God" - a scientist who proved the existence of God using the principles of quantum physics.

- **LAWRENCE PRINCIPE and R.K. MERTON**: Proponents of integration model. MERTON pointed out how the Protestant ethics contributed immensely to the development of modern science (similar to Weberian argument about Protestant ethics and capitalism).

| Model            | View of Relationship   | Key Features                                      | Main Proponents                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Conflict**     | Incompatible opposites | Religion vs science, zero-sum relationship        | RICHARD DAWKINS, PETER ATKINS      |
| **Independence** | Separate domains       | Non-overlapping magisteria, different purposes    | STEPHEN JAY GOULD                  |
| **Dialogue**     | Mutual learning        | Respect-based interaction, complementary benefits | FARADAY INSTITUTE, ALVIN PLANTINGA |
| **Integration**  | Unified knowledge      | Holistic approach, historical precedent           | LAWRENCE PRINCIPE, R.K. MERTON     |

## SECTS AND CULTS (80:11)

### Four-Fold Classification of Religions

Scholars like TROELTSCH developed a typology of religions. TROELTSCH developed a two-fold typology and classified religions into two types: Church and Sect. This classification was further developed by scholars like WEBER and HOWARD BAKER. Finally, we now have a four-fold classification, so religions are now classified into four types as follows:

1. **Church**
2. **Denomination** 
3. **Sect**
4. **Cult**

### Church Type Religion

- **Definition**: When a religion enjoys a monopoly in a society, it is known as church.

- **Characteristics**:
  
  - When there is only one religion and when you have a mono-religious society, then the religion is known as church type
  - They have a large number of members since everybody in the society belongs to the same religion
  - Their members are drawn from all strata of the society - rich, poor, and middle class
  - They develop a hierarchical structure, a hierarchy of officials (since they have to cater to a very large population)
  - New members are acquired by birth
  - The church has a very close relationship with other social institutions including the state

- **Example**: Islam in societies like Afghanistan where the whole population is Muslim and subscribes to the same religion. The laws are also as per Islamic jurisprudence, education system is also as per the religion.

### Denomination Type Religion

- **Definition**: When in a society there are multiple religions in existence, then every major religion is known as a denomination.

- **Characteristics**:
  
  - Denominations exist in a situation of religious pluralism
  - They also have large numbers of members
  - Their members are drawn from all strata like churches
  - They also have a hierarchy of officials
  - New members are acquired by two ways - either by birth or by conversion
  - They do not have a close relationship with the state and other social institutions (because if any one of them will be close to the state, it will lead to conflict)

- **Examples**: In India, Islam is a denomination, Hinduism is a denomination, Christianity is a denomination - each being one of the major religions among many.

#### Church vs Denomination: Tolerance Levels

- **Denominations are more tolerant** than churches because:
  - There are more options available in denominational societies
  - Churches have to be rigid if they have to preserve their monopoly
  - Churches very vehemently oppose any new and other religious belief
  - Denominations, given the practical situation that there are other religions present, have to be more tolerant, accommodating and accepting of alternative beliefs

### Sect Type Religion

- **Definition**: Sects are relatively smaller and relatively newer religious groups.

- **Key Distinction**: Sects are born out of a parent religion. They are kind of an offshoot of a parent religion. Sects arise protesting against some element of the parent religion.

#### Characteristics of Sects

- **Size and Structure**: 
  
  - Relatively smaller in size
  - Typically non-hierarchical or less hierarchical
  - Members are drawn from the lower strata (they are more likely to be dissatisfied with the parent religion)

- **Relationship with Society**: 
  
  - Sects are considered to be in opposition to the world
  - Their typical argument is that the parent religion has somewhat become corrupted over time
  - They need to revert back to the parent religion in its pure form

- **Commitment Level**: Sects expect a very high level of commitment from their members (because they are standing in opposition to the parent mainstream religion and need committed members to challenge the mainstream)

- **Leadership**: Sects are often led by charismatic leaders

- **Self-Perception**: Sects see themselves as uniquely legitimate (like churches, they claim monopoly over religious truth)

#### Scholarly Perspectives on Sects

**According to ROY WALLIS**:

- Sects are deviant religious groups which see themselves as uniquely legitimate
- They are regarded by others as deviant, but they consider that they alone are doing it rightly

**According to STARK and BAINBRIDGE**:

- Sects are groups that are formed as an offshoot of an existing religion
- They are an outcome of a schism or division in the parent religion

#### Membership and Evolution of Sects

- **Membership Acquisition**: Not through birth (because beyond a generation it is very difficult to sustain the deep level of commitment that sects require). Sects basically attract members by convincing members of the parent religion to join their fold.

- **Possible Outcomes for Sects**:
  
  1. **Convert into a Denomination**: If able to continuously attract new members
  2. **Die Out**: If not able to attract new members (it will fizzle out and lose relevance)
  3. **Institutionalize**: May develop a more formal structure and continue as a sect

#### Examples of Sects

- **BRAHMO SAMAJ**: Was a sect born out of the parent religion of Hinduism, protesting against certain elements of it. It has fizzled out.
- **ARYA SAMAJ**: Has institutionalized and continues to exist as a sect within Hinduism with a formal structure and governing body.
- **Buddhism**: Emerged as a sect from within the parent religion of Hinduism and became a denomination.
- **Protestantism**: Emerged as a sect from the parent religion of Christianity and has now become a denomination.

### Cult Type Religion

- **Key Distinction**: Cults do not have a parent religion. They are not a break-away faction from a parent religion. Instead, they offer a completely new religious belief system.

#### Characteristics of Cults

**According to STARK and BAINBRIDGE**: Cults are a new religion.

**According to STEVE BRUCE**:

- Cults are very loosely knit

- They do not have members, they have customers

- They do not have a very rigid program to be very dutifully followed

- They offer very vague kinds of religious beliefs and solutions to their members (rather customers)

- **Content Focus**: A lot of cults talk about individual peace and bliss

- **Loose Affiliation**: Cults have very loose affiliation of their members

- **Lack Sharp Definition**: Cults lack a very sharply defined belief system

- **Vague Themes**: Instead they may offer some vague and common, loosely defined themes like individual peace or bliss to their customers

#### Examples of Cults

- **HEAVEN'S GATE**: UFO-based cult
- **AETHERIOUS SOCIETY**: UFO-based cult  
- **RAELIANS**: UFO-based cult

These are classic UFO-based cults that believe extraterrestrials have established life on earth, and when the world becomes very corrupted, the creators will come in their UFOs and destroy this planet, saving those who worship them.

#### Contextual Classification Examples

- **NATION OF ISLAM**: 
  
  - In American context: A cult (because for blacks in America, the parent religion is Christianity, and Nation of Islam is not an offshoot of Christianity)
  - Claims that Christianity is the religion of slavery and the original religion of blacks was Islam

- **INTERNATIONAL SRI KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS (HARE KRISHNA MOVEMENT)**:
  
  - In India: A sect (offshoot of Hinduism)
  - In America: A cult (completely new belief system)

#### Negative Connotations and Alternative Terminology

- The word "cult" has acquired a negative connotation in public discourse
- People say that cults prey on vulnerable sections of society and have very strong leaders with strong control
- Cults are associated with brain washing, mass hysteria, mass suicides, and occult phenomena

**Alternative Terminology**: Because the term cult has acquired negative connotations, some sociologists and academia suggest using the term **"New Religious Movements"** instead, which is devoid of any negative connotations.

| Type             | Size  | Age | Parent Religion | Hierarchy | Member Source | Tolerance          | Relationship with Society |
| ---------------- | ----- | --- | --------------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Church**       | Large | Old | N/A (Monopoly)  | Yes       | All strata    | Low (Rigid)        | Close with state          |
| **Denomination** | Large | Old | N/A (Plural)    | Yes       | All strata    | High               | Separate from state       |
| **Sect**         | Small | New | Yes             | Low       | Lower strata  | Low (Unique claim) | Opposition                |
| **Cult**         | Small | New | No              | Low       | Varied        | Medium             | Loose connection          |

### Reasons for Growth of Sects and Cults

#### 1. Marginalization (WEBER)

- Sects and cults thrive amongst the marginalized sections of the society

#### 2. Relative Deprivation (ROY WALLIS)

**BRIAN WILSON** suggests that people may get marginalized due to various factors such as:

- Economic collapse
- Defeat in war  
- Natural disasters, etc.

**ROY WALLIS** expands this concept and says more important than marginalization is relative deprivation:

- Sects are an outcome of relative deprivation
- Those who are materially prosperous but spiritually deprived seek salvation and a sense of community and belonging, which these groups offer

#### 3. Periods of Rapid Social Change (BRIAN WILSON)

According to BRIAN WILSON, sects and cults gain popularity during periods of rapid social change.

#### 4. Modernization Effects (STEVE BRUCE)

STEVE BRUCE says that sects and cults grow due to the conditions created by modernization:

- Modernization leads to secularization
- Religion gets sidelined  
- People tend to congregate to these babas and gurus, etc.

#### 5. Technology

- Technology gives sects and cults and their leaders a wide reach
- Earlier, limited people would meet, but now on the internet, every person can find clients for their ideas

### ROY WALLIS Classification Matrix

ROY WALLIS has created an illustrative classificatory scheme for sects and cults using a 3√ó3 matrix:

|                                | **Respectable** | **Deviant** |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ----------- |
| **Uniquely Legitimate**        | Church          | Sect        |
| **Pluralistically Legitimate** | Denomination    | Cult        |

**Explanation**:

- **Horizontal Axis**: How the religion is viewed by society (respectable vs deviant)
- **Vertical Axis**: How the religion views itself (uniquely legitimate vs pluralistically legitimate)
- Churches and denominations are seen as respectable by mainstream society
- Sects and cults are viewed as deviant by mainstream society  
- Churches claim they are the sole right religion
- Denominations claim they are right but accept others may also be right
- Sects claim they are uniquely legitimate
- Cults are more accepting and accept they are right but others may also be right

## MONISM AND PLURALISM (158:13)

### Understanding Monism

- **Important Distinction**: Monism is not the same as monotheism, which it is often confused with.

- **Monotheism**: A monotheistic religion like Islam believes there is only one God.

- **Monism**: A philosophy which says that there is only one thing, one element. It is a religious philosophy that proposes that all existence is one.

#### Key Concepts of Monism

- **Monists believe in the unity or oneness of all reality**
- The term monism was first used by CHRISTIAN WOLFF to refer to those philosophies which eliminate the dichotomy between the body and the mind and explain all phenomena by one unifying principle

#### Example: ADVAITA VEDANTA

**ADI SHANKARA's Advaita Vedanta philosophy** is a monist philosophy:

- **Advaita Meaning**: Literal meaning is "there are no two"
- **Brahma Concept**: 
  - Brahma is eternal, unchanging, infinite and transcendental reality
  - Brahma is the source of all matter, time, energy, space, being, everything in the universe and beyond
  - Brahma is the highest universal principle and the ultimate reality
  - Brahma is all-pervasive, timeless, genderless, eternal truth

#### Upanishadic Statements

- **Aham Brahmasmi** (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad): "I am Brahma"
- **Tat Tvam Asi**: "You are That" (referring to Brahma)
- Brahma is that timeless, eternal, infinite truth which is all-encompassing and beyond definition

#### Monism in Sikhism

- **Sikh religious philosophy is also monist**
- The soul (atma) is a part of and ultimately merges with the Supreme Soul
- Beautifully written that just as streams emerge from rivers and eventually merge back into them, different souls spring up from the Supreme Soul and eventually merge back into the Supreme Soul (Paramatma)

#### Brahma as Sat-Chit-Ananda

- **Sat**: Truth
- **Chit**: Consciousness  
- **Ananda**: Bliss
- All combined, that is Brahma - an all-encompassing definition that is beyond definition

### Understanding Pluralism

The word pluralism can be understood in two different senses in the religious context:

#### 1. Philosophical Pluralism (Opposite of Monism)

- **Definition**: A philosophy which holds that there are many kinds of things - plurality of things with different essences
- According to WILLIAM JAMES: "Pluralism is a doctrine of multiplicity"
- In essence, we are not all same; you and I are not one - different elements have different essences

#### 2. Religious Pluralism (Societal Context)

- When we say that in a society there are multiple religions co-existing
- Like in India there is religious pluralism - Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, etc.

### Dualism as Example of Pluralism

**Dualism** is a pluralistic philosophy and an example of pluralism which considers that the creator and the creation are two distinct and separate things.

#### Characteristics of Dualistic Philosophies

- **Clear Distinction**: Dualistic philosophies maintain a very clear distinction between:
  
  - The natural and the supernatural
  - The creator and the creation  
  - The eternal and the temporal

- **Two Levels of Reality**: According to dualist philosophy, there are two levels of reality, and the distance between them cannot be bridged. It's a very clear distinction which is always maintained between the two distinct levels of reality.

#### Examples of Dualistic Religions

- **Christianity**: Regarded as a dualistic philosophy
  
  - Creator is different from His creation
  - The supernatural world is another realm of reality than the natural world
  - Creator is infinitely superior to creation

- **Islam**: Much of Islamic philosophy and mainstream Islam is dualist in character
  
  - Maintains that clear unbridgeable distinction between the creator and creation
  - However, certain strands within Islam (like Sufism, particularly popular in the Indian subcontinent) have a monist element where the creator and creation merge into each other
  - This may be due to Hindu influence, but mainstream conventional Islam is dualist, quite like Christianity

| **Pluralism (Philosophical)** | Multiple distinct things exist | Multiplicity of essences, separate elements                      | Dualism                         |
| **Pluralism (Religious)**     | Multiple religions coexist     | Religious diversity in society                                   | India's multi-religious society |
| **Dualism**                   | Two distinct realities         | Clear separation between creator/creation, natural/supernatural  | Christianity, mainstream Islam  |
