# MAX WEBER: SOCIAL ACTION, IDEAL TYPES, AND METHODOLOGY

## REMAINING TOPICS FROM KARL MARX (15:27)

### Asiatic Mode of Production

- **Asiatic mode of production**: A distinct type developed by Marx to specifically refer to the nature of the economy in pre-colonial India and China
- Pre-colonial Indian society did not fit into Marx's universal schema of primitive communism → ancient slave → feudal → capitalist → communist societies

#### Characteristics of Asiatic Mode of Production

**Land Ownership:**

- There was no private ownership of land
- Land was owned communally by the village community
- Ultimate ownership of all land vested in the monarch

**Economic Structure:**

- Primarily an agrarian economy combined with light manufacturing
- Light manufacturing included cloth manufactured using handspun methods and spinning wheels
- Basic manufacturing and agriculture and allied activities

**Social Organization:**

- Indian society was organized in terms of self-sufficient village communities
- All the needs of the villagers were satisfied from within the village
- For example, tools made of iron were provided by lohas or iron smiths within the village

**Political Authority:**

- A central authority in the form of a king or monarch extracted tribute from the village communities
- Two bases for this tribute collection:
  1. **Brute military power** - standing armies to extract compliance
  2. **Control over irrigation systems** - kings developed long drawn irrigation systems spanning across villages

**Hydraulic Civilizations:**

- These Asiatic societies are also referred to as hydraulic civilizations because of the importance of water resources and irrigation systems

#### Continuity of Asiatic Societies

- **Remarkable continuity**: Asiatic societies exhibited remarkable continuity over very long periods of time spanning several centuries even millennia
- Despite tumultuous changes in the polity at the central level, the village communities remained almost untouched
- Villages remained the same kind of society and economy across different periods (Mauryan period to Mughal period)
- **Reason for continuity**: Villages were mostly self-sufficient, so changes at the central level did not affect the village community

#### Impact of Colonial Rule

- Colonial rule broke the self-sufficiency of villages
- **Progressive changes according to Marx**:
  - Commercialization of agriculture
  - New education systems
  - Colonial rule was progressive because Asiatic economies and societies were stagnant
  - Colonial rule broke their stagnancy, ended their stagnation and unleashed new productive forces

#### Criticisms of Asiatic Mode of Production

1. **Similarity to feudalism**: Many critics suggest that pre-colonial Indian economy was not very vastly different from feudal Europe - it was simply feudal in character according to critics

2. **Stalin's ban**: In Soviet Russia, Stalin banned the use of the concept of Asiatic mode. Trotsky had endorsed this concept particularly to explain Chinese society. Due to political and ideological reasons between Stalin and Trotsky, Soviet Russia under Stalin banned the use of the concept

3. **Abandonment by Marx and Engels**: In their later writings, Marx and Engels themselves abandoned this idea of an Asiatic mode of production

### Practice/Praxis

- **Practice**: The concept literally means to practice, to do, to act
- **Contrast with theorizing**: Practice is contrasted with theorizing (analyzing, writing, reading, extensively assessing social situations)

#### Marx's Emphasis on Practice

- **Purpose of theorizing**: Theory alone is not an end in itself - the purpose is to bring about social change
- **Marx's quote**: "Philosophers across the globe have interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it."
- **Practical activity**: Theoretical contradictions can be resolved only through practical activity

#### Characteristics of Practice

- **Praxis refers to**: The process by which a theory is realized/implemented
- **Definition**: Praxis refers to engaging in activity, implementing ideas and bringing about social change
- **Human creation**: According to Marx, man creates and brings about changes in his world

#### Practice as Uniquely Human

- **Uniquely human**: Practice is uniquely human and it distinguishes man from all other beings
- **Animal behavior**: Other animals merely engage in compulsive unconscious acts
- **Human consciousness**: Only man engages in conscious and productive activity
- **Thought-out action**: Practice is thought-out action where you want to create a certain kind of social reality and take active steps in pursuit of that end goal

### Commodity Fetishism

#### Understanding Commodity

- **Use value**: Any thing has a certain use value - its utility to man or which human need it satisfies
  
  - Water: quenches thirst, used for cooking, washing clothes
  - Cloth: covers the body, protects against elements of nature
  - Mobile phone: primarily communication device, also alarm, camera

- **Exchange value**: When things are assigned a monetary price, they can be bought and sold in the marketplace

- **Objects turn into commodities**: When they acquire an exchange value, i.e., a value which can be expressed in the market

#### Commodification Under Capitalism

- **Everything commodified**: In capitalist mode of production, eventually everything will be commodified
- **Examples**: Things that were earlier given and taken, but not bought and sold, will eventually enter into the world of commerce
  - Care: Nurses available for care at 2,500 rupees per hour
  - Government calculating the size of the care economy in India

#### Understanding Fetishism

- **Religious context**: Originally from religious context where primitive people attribute a lot of power to certain stones or trees or objects
- **Sexual context**: In modern usage, refers to intense arousing effects (foot fetish, leather fetish)
- **Core meaning**: Attributing immense power and control to objects

#### Commodity Fetishism Explained

- **Definition**: In capitalism, commodities or things which are bought and sold in the market are considered as having immense importance or immense power over man
- **Things become all important**: Things become all important in capitalist societies
- **Hidden labor**: Any commodity has an exchange value due to the application of human labor, but this relationship between commodity and human labor is absent

**Examples of Commodity Fetishism:**

- When purchasing a desk or mobile phone, we don't consider the human labor power spent to create it
- We attribute independent value to products as if divorced from any human labor power
- We pay ₹75,000 because it's an Apple mobile phone, ₹15,000 because it's Samsung - treating things as having intrinsic value

#### Social Relations as Commodified

- **Buyer-seller relationship**: Becomes a relationship between money and commodity rather than between persons
- For the seller, the buyer is the money in their pocket
- For the buyer, the seller is the commodity they host
- Relationship between persons becomes relationship between things

### Reification

- **Concept by George Lukács**: Not by Karl Marx, but by Marxist scholar George Lukács
- **Meaning**: Literally means "to make into a thing" - thingification
- **Process**: Under capitalism, everything becomes eventually a thing, even the seeming intangibles

#### Examples of Reification

**Human emotions expressed through things:**

- Love expressed through diamonds, roses, Archie's cards purchased from the market
- Even deep human emotions are expressed through things bought and sold in the marketplace

**Social relations as things:**

- Subjects are turned into objects
- Human beings are treated as passive non-human entities
- Even intimate relationships (husband-wife, mother-child) are affected by thingification
- Social relationships are expressed in terms of things

## SOCIAL ACTION (100:02)

### Fundamental Concept

- **Social action**: The fundamental unit of analysis when trying to develop any understanding of society
- **Subject matter of sociology**: According to Weber, sociology is the systematic study of social action
- **What we study**: When we study sociology, we study social action

### Definition of Social Action

- **Weber's definition**: Social action refers to the meaningful act which is oriented in its course

#### Key Terms Explained

**Meaningful:**

- The social actor attaches a subjective meaning to that action
- The term meaningful means that the social actor attaches subjective meaning to the action

**Oriented in its course:**

- Oriented towards other actors, counter actors, other social actors
- Takes into account the behavior of others or seeks to influence the behavior of others or is influenced by the presence of others
- Whatever a social actor does keeping others in mind

### Examples of Social Action

**Teaching a class:**

- Teacher attaches meaning to action (meaningful)
- Trying to influence others or influenced by presence of others (oriented)
- Therefore, it is social action

**Nodding heads:**

- Students attach meaning ("I'm getting it")
- Oriented towards teacher and fellow students (conveying agreement)
- Therefore, it is social action

**Praying together:**

- Chanting Om in beginning of lecture carries meaning for actor
- Influenced by or seeks to influence others
- Therefore, it is social action

**Praying alone:**

- Chanting Om in room alone is NOT social action
- Lacks orientation towards others

**Eating in restaurant:**

- Following table manners because mindful of presence of others
- Therefore, it is social action

**Eating alone in room:**

- Might eat like an animal without considering others
- NOT social action

**Blinking vs. Winking:**

- Blinking: involuntary, not meaningful - NOT social action
- Winking: attaches meaning, oriented towards others - IS social action

### Four Types of Social Action

| Type              | Alternative Names                                | Characteristics                                                                                   | Examples                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Affectual**     | Emotional Social Action                          | Based on underlying emotions (fear, love, anger, etc.)                                            | Mother slapping child in rage; street corner fight; road rage                               |
| **Traditional**   | -                                                | Guided by custom, done in accordance with established conventions and long-held traditions        | Touching feet of elderly relatives; following family customs                                |
| **Zweckrational** | Formal Rationality; Goal-oriented Rational       | Both goals and means chosen rationally; clearly defined goals pursued through best possible means | Business actions in capitalist economy (profit maximization goal, rational means selection) |
| **Wertrational**  | Substantive Rationality; Value-oriented Rational | Goal may be value-driven (not rational), but means to achieve it are rational                     | Rejecting bribes to uphold values of integrity and honesty                                  |

#### Detailed Explanations

**Affectual Social Action:**

- Social action which is based on underlying emotions such as fear, love, anger, etc.
- Anchored in the emotional state of the actor
- Examples: Mother slapping child in rage, hugging long-lost friend tight, fist fights, road rage cases

**Traditional Social Action:**

- Refers to social actions guided by custom or done in accordance with established conventions and long-held traditions
- Done without much application of mind, without being driven by emotion or rationality
- Simply following things because they are the done thing
- Example: Touching feet of elderly relatives as matter of custom, mechanical reflex reactions

**Zweckrational Social Action:**

- Social actions in which both the goals and the means are chosen rationally
- Clearly defined goals are pursued through the best possible means
- Example: Real estate developer choosing location and property type based on rational considerations of budget, construction costs, selling prices to maximize profits

**Wertrational Social Action:**

- An action is wertrational when it is rational in terms of certain values that the social actor wants to uphold
- Goal itself may be value-driven and not rational, but the means to achieve it are rational
- Example: Bureaucrat rejecting bribes to uphold values of integrity - goal may not lead to benefit maximization but helps uphold values

### Determining Type of Social Action

- **Subjective meaning**: Which type of action depends on meaning attached by the social actor
- **Same action, different meanings**: Same action may be classified into different types depending on subjective meaning
- **Examples**:
  - Coming to work by car: Could be affectual (love for car), zweckrational (evaluated options), or traditional (family tradition)
  - Choosing sociology optional: Could be zweckrational (evaluated subjects), affectual (love for sociology), or traditional (family tradition)

## VERSTEHEN METHODOLOGY (144:07)

### Three Components of Weberian Methodology

1. **Causal Pluralism**
2. **Verstehen**
3. **Ideal Types**

### Causal Pluralism

- **Definition**: According to Weber, there are multiple causative factors that are at play behind any social phenomena under investigation
- **Contrast to monocausal explanations**: Weber's methodology is in stark contrast to monocausal explanations of social phenomena such as Karl Marx's emphasis on economic factors to analyze any social change

#### Weber's Approach vs. Marx's Approach

- **Weber's humility**: Weber studied how capitalism developed because of Protestant religious beliefs, but acknowledged multiple other causative factors existed
- **Limitations acknowledged**: Weber recognized his limitations of time, resources, knowledge - couldn't explore all causative factors
- **Focus on one factor**: Weber focused only on how Protestant beliefs shaped emergence of modern capitalism
- **Not universal claims**: Unlike Marx, Weber didn't make universal claims

### Verstehen Method

- **Literal meaning**: The word Verstehen literally means to understand or to interpret
- **What to understand**: The meaning attached by the actor to his actions
- **Purpose**: As researchers/sociologists, we need to understand or interpret the meaning attached by actor

#### Two Parts of Verstehen

**1. Aktuelles Verstehen:**

- **Meaning**: Direct observational understanding
- **Method**: Gather information through direct observation of actor in social action
- **Information gathered**:
  - Level of engagement in activity
  - Social class indicators
  - Gender identification
  - Age bracket estimation
  - Frequency of performing the act

**Limitations of Direct Observation:**

- Similar to positivist methods
- Only shows visible dimension/aspects of reality
- Cannot decode meanings (which are internal to actor)
- Important but not complete method

**2. Erklarendes Verstehen:**

- **Meaning**: Empathetic understanding or empathetic liaising
- **Process**: Researcher imaginatively places himself in the shoes of the social actor
- **Purpose**: To decipher the subjective meaning that the actor attaches to his action

#### Empathy vs. Sympathy

- **Sympathy**: Pitying someone from position of relative advantage (giving money to beggars)
- **Empathy**: Feeling what other person is feeling, seeing yourself in their situation
- **Example**: Understanding street kid stealing wallet because you've experienced hunger

#### Liaising in Government Context

- **Meaning**: Setting connections with right people, greasing palms if needed to ensure work is done smoothly
- **Empathetic liaising**: Researcher establishes empathetic connection with social actor

### Wide Application of Verstehen

- **Weber's principle**: "One need not be Caesar in order to understand Caesar"
- **Cross-category understanding**: 
  - Man can understand woman
  - Brahman can understand Dalit
  - American researcher can understand Indian citizen
- **Method**: Imaginatively place yourself in shoes of other social actor
- **Weber's example**: Weber wrote about Protestant beliefs several centuries before him affecting their actions and leading to capitalism development

#### Requirements for Verstehen

- **Not necessary**: Researcher need not belong to same social category as the researched
- **Wide application**: Method has very wide application across time and across cultures
- **Process**: Consider yourself in their situation to decipher meaning they attach to actions

## IDEAL TYPES (163:06)

### Need for Ideal Types

- **Social reality complexity**: Social reality is very vast, complex, and complicated
- **Weber's assessment**: Social reality is essentially incomprehensible, beyond comprehension
- **Multiple actors**: Many social actors performing innumerable social actions on daily basis
- **Research challenge**: How to make sense of this very complex, almost infinite variety of social actions and subjective meanings

### Definition and Basic Understanding

- **Basic definition**: Ideal types are models or concepts that a researcher develops
- **Purpose**: Models of the social world which researcher develops to make some sense of incomprehensible, vast, unorganized, complex social reality

### Understanding Models Through Examples

#### Solar System Model

**Components included:**

- Sun (biggest ball, orange/yellow)
- Planets in order with relative sizes
- Elliptical or circular orbits
- Asteroids between Mars and Jupiter

**What model captures:**

- Relative size of celestial bodies
- Colors visible to human eye
- Basic orbital patterns

**What model doesn't capture:**

- Gaseous composition
- Presence of life on planets
- Many other complex aspects

#### Democracy Model

**Components included:**

- Freedom of speech and expression
- Free and fair regular elections
- Separation of powers
- Rights to life, liberty, etc.
- Universal adult franchise
- Free media
- Independent election commission
- Vibrant civil society

**Reality vs. Model:**

- Real democracies don't have truly free media (corporate interests, political pressures)
- Elections affected by money power, muscle power
- Model shows things in pure, extreme form

### Characteristics of Ideal Types

#### Pure Types

- **Ideal type is a pure type**: Things portrayed in extreme or pure form, undiluted, unadulterated
- **Examples**:
  - "Free media" not "somewhat free media"
  - "Free and fair elections" not "mostly free and fair elections"
  - Round ball for earth not geoid-shaped ball

#### Fictional Character

- **Not found in reality**: Will not find such democracy with all ideal features anywhere in world
- **No one-on-one correspondence**: One will not see one-on-one correspondence between social phenomena in empirical world and how it is represented in ideal type

#### Caricature vs. Photograph

- **More like caricature**: Ideal type is more like a caricature than a photograph
- **Caricature characteristics**:
  - Certain features chosen and accentuated/highlighted/deepened
  - Exaggerated to drive home specific points
- **Examples**:
  - Lalu Yadav cartoon: mighty big nostrils, big ears, long hair, kurta pajama
  - Sonia Gandhi cartoon: very elongated nose, very slim figure, broad forehead

### Construction Process

- **Researcher's ideas**: Model of social reality developed by researcher using his ideas
- **Selective process**: Researcher selects only certain traits of social phenomena while constructing ideal type
- **Essential features**: Researcher captures only some essential features and not the totality of reality
- **Empirical basis**: Ideal types are developed after fairly thorough acquaintance with empirical reality

### Purpose and Utility

#### Why Create Ideal Types?

**Making sense of complexity:**

- Social reality is vast and complex, beyond comprehension
- Developing ideal types enables researcher to make some sense of this vast and chaotic social reality
- Humanly impossible to capture all dimensions of complex social phenomena

**Methodological tool:**

- Ideal type is a methodological tool developed by researcher which facilitates his research
- Mental construct that helps researcher in systematic characterization of empirical reality

#### Specific Functions

**Analysis and Understanding:**

- Help researcher to analyze and understand social reality
- Enable researcher to define, classify and investigate social reality keeping aside his own prejudices

**Classification and Comparison:**

- Particularly help in classification and comparison of social phenomena in empirical world
- Can compare democracy in India with democracy in America and Pakistan
- Serves as standard that enables comparison in empirical reality

**Practical Applications:**

- Research bodies rate democracies using models (Freedom House project)
- Classify countries as full democracy, partial democracy based on extent of freedoms
- Help develop definitions of social phenomena

### Examples of Ideal Types in Sociology

- **Weber's social action types**: Four types of social action are ideal types
- **Durkheim's solidarity**: Mechanical and organic solidarity are ideal types
- **Durkheim's suicide types**: Four types of suicide are ideal types
- **Durkheim's society types**: Pre-industrial and industrial society characterizations

**Reality vs. Models:**

- Social reality is far more complex and complicated
- Cannot be so neatly classified
- But developing these models/classificatory schemes/concepts help make sense of very complex and almost incomprehensible social world
