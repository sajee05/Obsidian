# Politics and Society: Social Movements, Revolution, and State

## Writing Practice and Exam Strategy Discussion (00:00)

- Students need to work on writing speed and time management for UPSC preparation
- Many students are taking 20-25 minutes for 10-mark questions, need to reduce to 8 minutes
- **Writing optimization suggestions:**
  - Reduce word density per page (currently fitting 500 words in 2 pages is too much)
  - Increase spacing between words and lines
  - Increase font size for better legibility
  - Natural handwriting should accommodate about 250 words per page maximum
- Statistical reality: Selection chances are low for any person, so students must maximize their chances by addressing speed issues
- Students must identify and overcome obstacles preventing selection

## Strain Theory by NEIL J. SMELSER (05:06)

- **Strain Theory**: Third comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing social movements
- According to NEIL J. SMELSER, there are **six conditions** that result in social movements in a society

### Six Conditions for Social Movements

#### 1. Structural Strain

- **Definition**: Some sort of discontent must exist in at least some section of society
- Some segment of society should experience **relative deprivation** and strain
- **Collective discontent, anguish, and deprivation** must be present
- If everything is "hunky dory" and "sab changa si," there will be no social movements

#### 2. Structural Conduciveness

- **Definition**: The social structure should somehow enable and make possible social movements
- The social structure should facilitate the occurrence of social movements
- **Urban vs Rural comparison**: Urban social structures are more conducive for social movements because:
  - Media houses with reporters, centers, and infrastructure exist in urban areas
  - More aware and engaged student community
  - Higher education and awareness levels about rights
  - Greater resource mobilization possibilities due to larger population
  - Easier crowd gathering (urban areas have crore plus populations vs village populations of ~1000)

#### 3. Generalized Belief

- **Definition**: People should have a common understanding of what the problem is
- All diverse life experiences of different segments of society must be collated under a common theme
- **Example**: ANNA Movement successfully developed generalized belief about corruption affecting everyone - students, housewives, small traders, rickshaw pullers, etc.

#### 4. Mobilization

- **Definition**: People need to be organized together for action

#### 5. Precipitating Factor

- **Definition**: A spark or catalyst that transforms collective discontent into a social movement
- Some sort of triggering event that compels people to come out on streets
- **Examples**:
  - ROSA PARKS incident for Black civil rights movement during MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'s time
  - Killings of GEORGE FLOYD and TREVOR MARTIN for Black Lives Matter movement
  - NIRBHAYA gang rape incident for women's safety movement in India

#### 6. Failure of Social Control

- **Definition**: Control mechanisms should not be very effective or strong, otherwise the movement might be nipped in the bud
- **Example**: During NIRBHAYA protests, had patriarchal controls been very strong and parents told girls not to go out, the movement would not have developed

## Life Cycle of Social Movements (21:45)

- Social movements pass through several stages
- **Scholars associated**: BLUMER, MAUSS, and TILLY (especially CHARLES TILLY - most intimately associated with study of social movements)

### Stages of Social Movement Development

| Stage                 | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emergence**         | Spark and precipitating factor transforms collective discontent into social movement                                                     |
| **Coalescence**       | Movement starts taking definitive shape; collective problems identified, agitations launched, grievances acknowledged                    |
| **Bureaucratization** | Movement becomes more formal and organized; organizational structures emerge, leadership identified, proper funding channels established |

### Possible Outcomes After Bureaucratization

#### Success

- Movement achieves its goals and objectives
- **Example**: Farm Bill protests - bills were rolled back by central government

#### Failure

- Objectives of the movement are not met
- **Example**: Anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests - government proceeded irrespective of protests

#### Co-optation

- **Definition**: Leadership of social movement is co-opted into existing social structures
- Leaders are accommodated and given place of dignity within existing sociopolitical structures
- **Example**: KEJRIWAL becoming part of existing political system after anti-corruption movement

#### Repression

- State uses repressive apparatus to crush the movement using brute force
- **Examples**: NAXALITE movement, KHALISTANI movement - secessionist movements have been repressed

#### Mainstreaming

- **Definition**: Goals and objectives of movement are adopted by wider society as its own
- **Example**: NIRBHAYA rape protests - whole society agreed that public spaces should be safe for women and girls

### Final Stage: Decline

- All movements eventually decline and end through one of the above pathways

## Ideology and Social Movements (34:48)

### Definition of Ideology

- **Ideology**: A set of coherent ideas, values, beliefs, and thoughts that enable an interpretation and understanding of reality
- Helps us make sense of the world around us
- **Analogy**: Like colored glasses - if you wear red glasses, you see everything red
- **Examples of different ideological perspectives**:
  - MARXIST ideology: sees conflict, oppression, exploitation everywhere
  - HINDUTVA ideology: different interpretation from DALIT/AMBEDKARITE ideology
  - GANDHIAN ideology: shows very different picture from MARXIST ideology

### Role of Ideology in Social Movements

- **Ideology is regarded as an integral component of social movements**
- **Functions of ideology**:

#### 1. Theoretical Framework

- Ideology provides a theoretical framework with aims and methods that constitute a well-defined sociopolitical program

#### 2. Problem Identification

- Ideology helps to identify the nature of the problem, ultimate objectives of the movement, and course of action to be adopted

#### 3. Binding Force

- **Ideology is like an adhesive** which binds a movement's participants into a cohesive whole
- Acts as the "glue" that holds diverse people together in the movement

#### 4. Justification and Rationalization

- Ideology helps to identify, justify, and rationalize the methods and tactics adopted by the movement
- **Examples**:
  - NAXALITE ideology justifies use of violence against class enemy
  - GANDHIAN ideology legitimizes use of non-violent methods

#### 5. Key Organizing Principle

- **Ideology is regarded as a key organizing principle of a social movement**

## Challenges for Social Movements (49:56)

### Resource Mobilization Challenges

- Any movement is resource-heavy, requiring entrepreneurial skills to put together various resources
- Mighty challenging task for leadership to gather people and funding

### Inertia

- **Definition**: Simple resistance to change; people get habituated to current situation and prevailing conditions
- Even if disadvantaged, there is inherent attractiveness about not doing anything
- **Complacent attitudes** and acceptance of status quo

### Legitimacy of Prevailing Order

- Any long-standing social arrangement develops certain legitimacy of its own
- Society starts considering long-running practices as correct
- **Example**: DOWRY system still has massive social acceptance despite laws against it

### Free Rider Problem

- **Definition**: People may believe in a cause but not actively participate
- **Analogy**: Like group work in college where some don't work but get same marks
- People agree with movement's agenda but don't attend protests, preferring comfort of home

### Repression by State and Vested Interests

- In prevailing arrangements, some sections are in advantageous positions and have vested interest in maintaining system
- **Examples of advantaged groups**:
  - Men in patriarchal society
  - Higher castes in caste system  
  - Rich/capitalists in capitalist society
- They may try to block change and suppress movements
- Vested interests are closer to state power than movement participants

### Maintaining Enthusiasm

- **Challenge**: Maintaining enthusiasm of participants for long periods
- People want to get on with their lives and have pressing concerns like daily bread and butter
- If system is unresponsive, movement may die due to lack of continued enthusiastic participation
- **Solution used historically**: Truce periods (like in freedom struggle) to let people recuperate

### Tussle for Leadership

- Internal conflicts within movement organization to capture leadership
- Being leader provides advantages:
  - Media coverage and popularity
  - Ability to negotiate deals for oneself
  - Material benefits
  - Power to impose views on participants

### Dependence on Charismatic Leaders

- **Problem**: Movements frequently led by charismatic figures
- **Issue with charisma**: It is by nature short-lived and person-specific
- When leader loses charisma or legitimacy, it can discredit the entire movement

## New Social Movements (74:14)

### Definition and Origin

- **According to SIMON HOWARTH**: New Social Movements refer to those social movements which emerged in Western liberal democratic societies during the **1960s and 70s (and onwards)**
- These movements challenged the prevailing sociopolitical and cultural arrangements of advanced capitalist societies

### What Made Them "New"

#### 1. Types of Issues Raised

- **Quality of life issues** rather than traditional economic concerns
- **Two broad categories**:

**Global Concerns:**

- Issues concerning whole of humanity
- **Examples**: Environmental movement, nuclear disarmament movement, world peace movement

**Marginalized Sections:**

- Concerns about marginalized sections of society  
- **Examples**: The disabled, sexual minorities (LGBTQI+), gay rights movement, immigrants' rights

#### 2. Support Base Characteristics

- **Participants**: Typically young (18-30 years of age)
- **Background**: New middle class - teachers, NGO workers, nurses, journalists
- Mostly young, educated people

#### 3. Organizational Structure

- **More decentralized** than older social movements
- Did not have rigid centralized bureaucratic structure
- Leaders typically not seeking power for themselves

#### 4. Global Character

- Many developed global reach and character
- Able to involve people across cultures
- **Technology's role**: Successfully harnessed latest technological developments, especially social media
- **Examples**: 
  - BLACK LIVES MATTER movement spread beyond US through social media
  - ME TOO movement started from Hollywood, spread globally to India, Pakistan, everywhere

### Comparison: Old vs New Social Movements

| Aspect           | Old Social Movements                                                       | New Social Movements                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**        | Primarily economic concerns (working class, peasants, wealth distribution) | Quality of life, post-materialistic concerns |
| **Participants** | More mature, older people                                                  | Young people (18-30), new middle class       |
| **Structure**    | More centralized, bureaucratic                                             | More decentralized, flexible                 |
| **Scope**        | Often national/local                                                       | Often global character                       |

### Criticism of New Social Movements Concept

- **Critics**: COHEN and RAY argue that "new" social movements are not really that new
- **Arguments**:
  - Movements have always tried to widen their support base
  - Lines are very blurred (e.g., feminist movement - old or new?)
  - Many "new" movements are also concerned about economic issues
  - **Example**: LGBT rights movement talks about equal access to jobs and non-discrimination in workplace

## Primordial Means and Progressive Agenda (87:59)

### Characteristics of Social Movements

- **Question context**: "Are social movements primordial in means and progressive in agenda?"

#### Primordial Means

- **Definition**: Relying upon very old, traditional methods and primordial identities
- **Examples of primordial aspects**:

**Identity-based mobilization:**

- Caste-based movements (JATS demanding reservation, MARATHAS, untouchables organizing)
- Religion-based movements  
- Ethnicity-based movements
- Appeal made along primordial identity lines

**Traditional methods:**

- Large-scale gatherings (dharna, demonstrations)
- Chakka jam (blocking regular conduct of business)
- Anshan (fast unto death)
- **Basic approach**: Simply having large numbers turn up as expression of public grievance

#### Progressive Agenda

- **Typical goals**: Modern, secular benefits
- **Examples**:
  - Educational opportunities
  - Job opportunities
  - Public employment access
  - Equal citizenship (as demanded in anti-CAA protests)

#### Important Clarification

- **Not categorical**: Methods employed may not necessarily all be pre-modern
- Many movements also employ modern methods:
  - Petitioning the government
  - Social media campaigns
  - Legal approaches
- **Combination approach**: Mix of primordial and modern methods

#### Agenda Considerations

- Agenda being mostly progressive but may not always be progressive
- **Non-progressive example**: Demand for building grand RAM temple in AYODHYA - not exactly a modern kind of aspiration

## Revolution (105:29)

### Understanding the Term Revolution

- Students gave various examples: FRENCH REVOLUTION, GREEN REVOLUTION, BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION, BHAGAT SINGH's revolutionary activities, WHITE REVOLUTION, YELLOW REVOLUTION, INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

### Distinguishing Revolution from Other Changes

#### What is NOT a Revolution

- **MODI's election as Prime Minister**: Not a revolution (even if historic)
- **15th August 1947**: Historic moment but not a revolution in sociological sense
- **SEPOY MUTINY/First War of Independence**: Not a revolution  
- **GREEN REVOLUTION**: Only nomenclature devised by government to indicate massive increase in agricultural production
- **Regime changes in Pakistan**: Military dictatorships overthrowing democratically elected governments - not revolutions

#### What IS a Revolution

- **FRENCH REVOLUTION**: Yes, was a revolution
- **INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION**: Yes, led to near complete transformation of whole society
- Both involved fundamental changes but INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION wasn't accompanied by large-scale violence while FRENCH and BOLSHEVIK revolutions were

### Definition of Revolution

- **Revolution refers to a social movement that brings about fundamental change in the economic, political, and social structures of a society**
- **Key characteristics**:
  - **Fundamental change** (not mere tinkering or small changes)
  - **Near complete restructuring** of social relations
  - **Collapse of old system** making way for new social order

#### Features of Revolution

- **Revolutions often involve the use of violence, but not always**
- **Not revolution**: Mere regime change, mutiny, rebellion, military coup
- **Revolution means**: Near complete restructuring of social relations
- **Revolution involves**: Collapse of old system making way for new social order

### Scholarly Perspectives on Revolution

#### SKOCPOL's Definition

- **"Revolutions are rare and transformative events that fundamentally alter the social structure, challenge dominant ideologies, and transform state organization"**

#### MARXIST Perspective

- **MARXIST ideology emphasizes upon the inevitability of the proletariat revolution in capitalist societies**

#### LENIN's View

- **LENIN considers that revolutions are "festivals of the oppressed" - who act as creators of a new social order**

#### SOROKIN's Critique

- **SOROKIN compares revolutions to a severe social illness that can lead to the sudden death of the social organism**
- Expresses preference for **reforms** - incremental changes rather than total transformation at one go
- Believes changes should be piecemeal, incremental, progressive through reforms to avoid disrupting society

## State (125:43)

### Initial Understanding

- **State**: What we broadly refer to as "country" in normal English
- In political science and political sociology, we refer to it as "state"
- **Different from**: Nation (will be discussed later)

### Relationship with Government

- **Government**: A component of state
- **State vs Government**: When we say "Indian state has attacked Pakistan," we mean Indian government on behalf of Indian people has attacked Pakistan
- Government is the visible arm of the state
- Powers of state are exercised by government; duties of state are performed by government

### WEBER's Definition

- **"State is a human community that successfully claims monopoly over the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory"**
- **Defining feature**: Monopoly over legitimate use of physical force (police power)

### MACIVER's Definition

- **"The state embraces the whole of the people in a given territory"**
- **Meaning**: It is mandatory for a person to submit to authority of state
- Must obey laws of state - cannot choose not to belong or not to obey
- **Different from voluntary associations**: Like RED CROSS, CHILD RELIEF - up to you to subscribe to their rules

### Primary Function

- **Special function of state**: Maintaining order

## Essential Characteristics of State (132:24)

### Four Essential and Defining Characteristics

#### 1. Territory

- **Includes**: Land, water, and air under its jurisdiction
- **Size requirements**: No minimum or maximum geographical spread criteria
- **Examples**:
  - **VATICAN CITY**: Half a square kilometer (smaller than distance to nearest shop)
  - **RUSSIA**: Spread across several hundreds of square kilometers
- **ANTARCTICA**: Continent but not a state because no people

#### 2. Sovereignty

- **Definition**: Supreme power to take decisions and implement them in its territory
- **Two dimensions**:

**External Sovereignty:**

- Not answerable to any power outside

**Internal Sovereignty:**  

- Authority cannot be questioned from within
- Cannot be superseded from within
- **Example**: HARYANA is not a state in political science sense because it's not sovereign

#### 3. People

- Must have population within territory
- **Size requirements**: No minimum/maximum number requirements
- **Examples**:
  - **VATICAN CITY**: Total population 1500 people (less than some big coaching institutes)
  - **CHINA/INDIA**: Billion plus populations

#### 4. Government

- **Definition**: The visible arm of the state
- **Function**: Agency through which state performs its functions
- Powers of state are exercised by government
- Duties of state are performed by government

### Contested Element: International Recognition

- **Some scholars**: Consider it necessary and integral characteristic

- **Others**: Consider it not necessary pre-condition

- **Debate**: Whether others recognize you or not is immaterial if you exercise control, have government in well-defined territory with clearly demarcated borders, and enjoy sovereignty

- **Practical importance**: Many secession movements have international arms trying to mobilize international community (LTTE for Tamil Eelam, KHALISTANI movement)
