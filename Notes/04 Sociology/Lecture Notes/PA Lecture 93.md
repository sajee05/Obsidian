| Language Hybrid | Components        | Usage                         |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Hinglish        | Hindi + English   | Most common across Hindi belt |
| Punglish        | Punjabi + English | Punjab region                 |
| Benglish        | Bengali + English | Bengal region                 |

### Timeline and Pioneers of Language Hybridization

**1990s Beginning:**

- Process began on large scale during 1990s
- **Pioneers**: College students studying in premier educational spaces like Delhi University
- Emerged in metropolitan cities, top universities as language of cool
- Signified youth, fluency in English, being comfortable in own skin

**Mass Popularization:**

- **Advertising industry** played crucial role in popularization
- MNCs coming to India used novel advertising campaigns
- **Iconic campaigns**: Pepsi's "Right choice baby" starring Aishwarya Rai and young Aamir Khan
- Numerous MNC advertisements harnessed power of Hinglish to connect with ordinary people

### Current Status

- Hinglish is lingua franca in Hindi belt today
- People barely use pure Hindi or pure English
- Not anymore limited to college students in elite institutions
- **Ordinary people, poor people** using Hinglish
- Has become common street level phenomena, possibly displacing pure form of languages

### Social Implications

**Linguist Purists' Concerns:**

- Development of hybrid languages indicates death of pure languages
- Neither pure Hindi has survived nor Queen's English
- **Historical comparison**: Nehru epitomized pure, unadulterated, fluent Hindi and mastered Queen's English
- **Current example**: Modi uses Hinglish as effective communicator

**Political Implications:**

- Language was one of key principles for regional consciousness and movements
- **Question**: Will person be as strongly emotionally connected to Hinglish as to Tamil?
- Political salience of languages as ethnic identity is declining
- **Observation**: States formed in 21st century or since globalization - none formed on linguistic basis

### Corruption Increase

**YOGENDRA YADAV's Analysis:**

- Globalization resulted in massive increase in political administrative corruption
- **Reasons for increase**:
  1. **From above**: Lot of money started pouring in from abroad (foreign investments)
  2. **From below**: Newer social groups joined political administrative system (Dalits, tribals, various OBC castes)
- Perfect recipe for big ticket corruption

**ASHIS NANDY's Controversial Comment:**

- At Jaipur Literary Festival commented that SCs, STs, and OBCs are caught more in corruption cases
- **Clarification**: Not saying they're more corrupt, saying they get caught more
- **Explanation**: They are newer participants in corruption exercise
- Upper castes have refined ways (funding Harvard education instead of direct cash)
