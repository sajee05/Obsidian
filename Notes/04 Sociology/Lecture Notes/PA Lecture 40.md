# Political Theories and Democracy: Modern Perspectives

## RECAP OF POWER THEORIES (15:17)

- In the last lecture, various theories of power were discussed
- **Variable Sum vs Constant Sum Concept of Power**:
  - **Variable Sum Concept**: Power can be expanded and shared without one losing at the expense of another
  - **Constant Sum Concept**: One gains power only at the expense of the other
- **MARXIST THEORY** subscribes to the constant sum view of power

### Marxist Theory of Power

- **Ideological State Apparatus**: Ideological conditioning device
  - Achieved through education system, religion
  - In pre-modern times: Religion was the primary ideological state apparatus
  - In modern times: Education system (both state-funded and private education)
  - The state controls and decides the curriculum
- **Repressive State Apparatus**: Uses ruthless force and coercion

### Classical Elite Theory - PARETO

- **PARETO** is a classical elite theorist
- **Two types of governing elites**:
  - **Lions**: Rule through brute force, are strong
  - **Foxes**: Rule through cleverness and cunning
- **Circulation of Elites**: Takes place throughout history between these two types
- **Key takeaway**: According to classical elite theorists, elite rule is inevitable in all societies throughout history

## MODERN ELITE THEORY BY C. WRIGHT MILLS (25:21)

- **C. WRIGHT MILLS** outlined the modern elite view of power in his book titled **"THE POWER ELITE"**
- **C. WRIGHT MILLS** is a 20th century American scholar who specifically analyzes the political system in America

### Key Differences from Classical Elite Theory

| Aspect                  | Classical Elite Theory                   | Modern Elite Theory                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inevitability**       | Elite rule is inevitable                 | Elite rule is NOT inevitable                                        |
| **Historical Context**  | Always existed                           | Relatively recent development in US (late 19th, early 20th century) |
| **Cause of Elite Rule** | Physical/psychological traits of persons | Institutional factors                                               |
| **Focus**               | Personal characteristics                 | Structural/institutional analysis                                   |

### The Three Key Institutions

- **Modern elite rule is due to institutional factors**: Those who occupy the command posts/top positions in three key institutions constitute a unified power elite
- **The Three Key Institutions**:
  1. **American Military**
  2. **Big Businesses/Corporations** 
  3. **Federal Government** (Central Government)

### Why Elite Rule is Recent in America

- **Economic Power**: Earlier dispersed among large number of small businesses, but with passage of time got concentrated into fewer large businesses
- **Political Power**: Was dispersed among federating units and states, but with passage of time got concentrated in central government
  - Under original US Constitution, states almost had power to secede from union
  - After Civil War, Supreme Court interpreted Constitution to deny states this power
- **Military Power**: Earlier dispersed among many local militias, with passage of time got concentrated in US military

### Characteristics of the Unified Power Elite

#### Similar Social Background

- **WASP (White Anglo Saxon Protestant)**: Term used by scholars like ANDREW HACKER and others to designate American elites
- They share similarity of:
  - Religious background (Protestant)
  - Racial background (White Anglo Saxon descent)
  - Educational background (Ivy League colleges, top colleges)
  - Social circles (same clubs)
  - **Intermarrying among themselves**: Lot of personal connections, for example a top military general's daughter married to a leading politician

#### Convergence of Interests

- **American capitalism is military capitalism**: Manufacture and sale of armaments is integral to American economy
- War benefits American industry, politicians, and military
- This is why America is regularly and incessantly at war throughout its modern history

#### Unprecedented Power

- The unified power elite enjoys unprecedented power
- **Major decisions affecting millions of people have been taken by this unified power elite behind closed doors without any consultation**
- Examples: Dropping of atomic bomb on HIROSHIMA and NAGASAKI, raising of interest rates by Federal Bank

## PLURALISM THEORY (47:08)

- **PLURALISM** means the existence of multiple/multiplicity
- This theory was developed by Western scholars in Western political context to explain Western democracies

### Key Scholars of Pluralism

- **ROBERT DAHL**
- **ARNOLD ROSE** 
- **RAYMOND ARON**

### Core Principles of Pluralism Theory

- **Multiple social groups and identities** in society are striving for power among themselves
- Different social groups strive for a greater share of the **limited resources of society**
- **How they engage in struggle**: Different social groups choose their respective representatives who then struggle for a greater share of limited resources of society on behalf of the groups

### Examples in Indian Society

- **Religious groups**: Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs all want something
- **Caste identities**: Yadavs, Scheduled Castes, Brahmins, Baniyas, Rajputs, Kayasthas all want greater share
- **Class groups**: Workers, industrialists, middle class
- **Gender groups**: Men, women, transgenders
- **Professional groups**: Doctors, engineers

### Politicians as Representatives

- **Politicians honestly represent the interests of those who have chosen them**
- Politicians honestly engage in struggle for power on behalf of the social groups which they represent
- Examples:
  - **MAYAWATI**: Protecting interests of Dalits
  - **LALU YADAV**: Securing interests of Yadavs  
  - **OWAISI**: Securing interests of Muslims
  - **YOGI**: Securing interests of Hindus

### Pluralism vs Other Theories

| Theory           | View of Democracy                                | Legitimacy                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Pluralism**    | Legitimizes Western liberal democracy            | Supports democratic systems     |
| **Marxist**      | Critical - sees it as bourgeois democracy        | Criticizes capitalist democracy |
| **Elite Theory** | Critical - denies fundamental claim of democracy | Criticizes democratic claims    |

- **Government acts like a broker**: Trying to balance competing interests
- Politics is all about **bargaining and compromise** to extract best deal for respective social groups
- Government tries to balance and work out compromise between diverse sections and interests

### Elite Pluralism

- **Same theory as Pluralism** but called Elite Pluralism because:
  - Acknowledges society is ruled by a few (elites)
  - **Unlike classical or modern elite theory, does not indict the elites**
  - Elites come from diverse social backgrounds
  - They are **honest representatives of diverse interests and cross-sections of society**
- **Justifies representative democracy** and few people participating in political system on behalf of many

## DEMOCRACY - DEFINITION AND FEATURES (66:47)

- **Democracy is by far the most popular form of government in modern times**
- **Definition**: Government of the people, by the people, and for the people (**ABRAHAM LINCOLN**)

### What is Democracy?

- **SAMUEL HUNTINGTON** writes that democracy is a political system in which **the most powerful collective decision makers are selected through fair, honest and periodic elections** in which **candidates freely compete for votes** and in which **virtually all of the adult population is eligible to vote**

### Features of Democracy

#### Essential Elements

- **Regular elections**
- **Free press**
- **Impartial election commission**: Independent and impartial body to oversee conduct of free and fair elections
- **Independent judiciary**
- **Accountability and transparency**
- **Decentralization of power**
- **Free speech**: Right to criticize government
- **Universal adult franchise**
- **Multiplicity of political parties**
- **Vibrant civil society**
- **Limitations on power of government**
- **Ideas of liberty and equality**
- **People's participation in governance**

#### Types of Democracy

- **Direct Democracy**: People directly participate in taking decisions affecting their collective lives through methods like referendum, plebiscite
- **Indirect/Representative Democracy**: People participate indirectly by choosing representatives who then form government and pass legislation

**Direct democracy is truer democracy** but **indirect democracy is the flavor of the day** in most modern societies due to **sheer practicality** - modern societies are very large-sized with millions of people.

## EVOLUTION OF DEMOCRACY (80:50)

### Historical Timeline

| Period                | Development                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ancient Times**     | Origins in Ancient Greece (city-states) and Ancient India (16 Mahajanapadas) - more than 2000 years back                   |
| **13th Century**      | **MAGNA CARTA** signed by British monarch - limited monarch's powers and transferred some power to proto-bodies            |
| **1265**              | First English Parliament came into existence                                                                               |
| **18th Century**      | **French Revolution** and **American Wars of Independence** - gave ideals of democracy, liberty, equality, fraternity      |
| **19th Century**      | Voting rights extended to women; removal of property and educational restrictions                                          |
| **Mid-20th Century**  | **Decolonization** - numerous ex-colonies in Asia, Africa, Latin America became independent and adopted democratic systems |
| **Mid-20th Century**  | **Civil Rights Movement in US** - people of color got democratic rights                                                    |
| **Late 20th Century** | After collapse of Soviet Russia (1989-1992) - many erstwhile communist states adopted democratic systems                   |
| **Recent Times**      | Democratic uprisings in various parts of world - **Arab Spring** and various **colored revolutions**                       |

### Theoretical Foundations

- **HOBBES, LOCKE, and ROUSSEAU**: Laid theoretical and philosophical foundations for democratic political systems
- **Social Contract Theory**: Argued that state is not a divine creation but outcome of social contract among people
- **MONTESQUIEU**: Gave concept of **separation of powers**

## DEMOCRACY'S GLOBAL POPULARITY (89:35)

### Statistical Evidence (PEW Research Analysis)

- **1977**: Out of 143 countries, only 35 (24%) were democracies while 62% were autocracies
- **2017**: Out of 167 countries, 57% were democracies, 13% were autocracies, and 28% were mixed

**Democracy has clearly seen an ascent, making it today by far the most popular form of government**

Even countries like **North Korea** call themselves "Democratic Republic of Korea" - all want to fashion and project themselves as democracies.

## WHY DEMOCRACY IS POPULAR (97:43)

### Arguments for Democracy

- **People's participation**: It allows people's participation and gives people freedom to cast their votes
- **Empowers the masses**: Only democracy empowers the people, the masses - no other form of government does it
- **Accountability**: Democracy ensures that government is held accountable to people on regular basis
- **Protects rights**: Only in democracies do people enjoy rights - in monarchies you have subjects, only in democracies do we have citizens (citizenship means rights)
- **Limited government**: Does not give absolute power to government - "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"
- **Opposition role**: Opposition plays very vital role in democracy
- **Rules-based decision making**: Not due to whimsical fancy of ruler
- **Secures rights of minorities**: 
- **Adaptive**: Can make new laws as per changing conditions and requirements
- **Inclusive participation**: Every section of society finds a voice
- **Consensus-based approach**: Discussion and consensus building based approach
- **People-centric government**: Only democracy can ensure a people-centric government
- **High legitimacy**: Democratic forms have very high degree of legitimacy in eyes of people because they are based on choice of people
- **Good governance**: Some would say good governance can be achieved only in democratic framework
- **Liberty and equality**: Cherishes ideals of liberty and equality
- **Respect and dignity**: Only in democracy does every person have respect and dignity irrespective of background

### Practical Considerations

- **Most practically feasible way** of organizing life of people in modern societies which are heterogeneous (multilingual, multireligious, multiethnic, multiracial)
- In such heterogeneous population, democratic polity is perhaps the only way of organizing life of people

## CRITICISMS OF DEMOCRACY (121:26)

### Philosophical Criticisms

#### PLATO's Critique

- **People are made of different kinds of elements**: Not everybody is suited for rule
- People are made up of souls of **gold, silver, and iron** - accordingly people have to be assigned social roles
- **Philosopher Kings should rule**: Those who can combine philosophizing with governance
- **Not everybody is meant for governance**
- **PLATO likens democracy to mobocracy (mob rule)**
- "When everybody is responsible then nobody is responsible"
- **Ship analogy**: If you were on a ship in turbulent waters, would you want decisions taken by majority vote or by the captain who is expert in steering the ship?
- **Governance requires certain qualities, leadership, expertise** - not all are capable of it

#### Marxist Critique

- **Western liberal democracies in capitalist societies are essentially bourgeois democracies**
- **Government of the bourgeois**: Concerns and interests of working class are not represented by political system
- **All political parties have quite similar economic policies and programs** - pro-capitalist
- **No real choice offered to people**: Choice is illusory ⭐ (This seems to be a generalized statement that may not apply universally to all democratic systems)
- **Elections are circus/tamasha**: Large scale spectacle which gives illusion to people that they really have power
- **Democracy ensures only political equality (one man one vote)** but real power stems from economic power
- **Democracy is a facade, a sham** - those who hold economic power wield the real power

#### LENIN's Critique

- **Western parliaments are mere talking shops**: A lot of talk takes place in parliament but real work of government (policy making, policy implementation) is done by unelected bureaucrats behind closed doors whose interests do they secure? The capitalists

#### Elite Theory Critique

- **Democracy is no different from other forms of government**: No substantially different from monarchy, theocracy, autocracy
- **All are elite rule**: Simply a handful of people ruling over the masses
- **Classical elite theory perspective**: Real democracy is impossible, people cannot rule, people have need to be led
- **People are passive, unconcerned about governance**
- **Modern elite theory perspective**: Those from similar exclusive background come to occupy key posts, enjoy unprecedented power, almost unanserable to people

#### TOCQUEVILLE's Concern

- **Democracy may degenerate into tyranny of the majority**
- Democracy is a game of numbers - those more in number get to form government and decide social policy
- **May well take care of concerns of majority but concerns of minority may be side-stepped**
- Example: Building of Ram Temple in Ayodhya - may express collective desire of Hindus (bulk of population) but what about concerns of Indian Muslims?

### Practical Criticisms

#### Representation Issues

- **Is representative democracy truly representative?**
- Analysis of Indian elections: Out of 130 crore population, about 90 crore are voters, 60% voter turnout = 55 crore votes cast, BJP got about 1/3 of votes = 18 crore votes
- **So Modi represents aspirations of 130 crore Indians based on 18 crore votes?**

#### Other Issues

- **Criminalization of politics**: Decent people don't enter politics - it's become field of criminals
- **Need muscle power and money power**
- **Defections reflecting rank opportunism**
- **Limited women participation**: Very few women ministers, MLAs, MPs
- **Caste and patriarchy**: Democracy has not been able to dent these
- **Decision making is very slow**
- **People selling votes for immediate gains** - for a family earning 6000 per month, getting 10,000 for votes makes rational sense

## PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRACY (149:02)

### Current Level of Participation

- **For bulk of population, participation in democracy is abysmally low**
- **For most people, democracy is reduced to half-hour exercise once in five years of casting vote**

### Classification by MILBRATH AND GOEL

In their book **"POLITICAL PARTICIPATION"**, people are classified into three types based on level of participation:

#### 1. Gladiators

- **Get directly involved in politics**
- Contest elections, give speeches, mobilize funds, conduct political campaigns and rallies
- **Those in the thick of things**

#### 2. Spectators

- **View politics from sidelines**
- Don't get down into thick of things but watch it, keep an eye over it
- Includes voters, political analysts, those who discuss politics

#### 3. Apathetic

- **Unconcerned about political matters**
- **Indifferent to politics**
- "Doesn't matter who comes - Modi or Rahul"

### Factors Affecting Participation

#### MILBRATH AND GOEL's Factors

- **Skill, time and energy** that people have
- Politics requires certain political acumen and skills
- Requires lot of time - very demanding job
- Requires loads of energy

#### VERBA AND KIM's Factors

- **What citizens believe that they can influence**
- More likely to participate where involvement results in affecting outcome vs where it won't affect outcome
- **Extent to which participation involves conflict** - people generally try to avoid conflict
- **Time and energy required for participation**
- **Need for cooperation with other political actors** to achieve objectives

### Entry Barriers to Political Participation

- **Monetary barriers**: Requires good amount of funding and ability to raise funds
- **Political connections**: May require certain political connections which one may not have
- **Identity factors**: In Indian context could be one's ascriptive or ethnic identity
- **Lack of political socialization and training**: Don't know how to become leader, raise funds, give speeches, rise up party ranks
- **Attitudinal barriers**: People generally want strong leaders and think in patriarchal terms
- **Disenfranchisement**: Certain communities/ethnic groups may be formally/informally disenfranchised (examples: Blacks in early 20th century US, transgenders in India until recently, migrants)
