# Theories of Caste: M.N. SRINIVAS and ANDRE BETEILLE

## Introduction and Current Affairs Approach (13:14)

- **Context Setting**: Previous lecture discussed views of GHURYE and DUMONT on caste system
- **Current Affairs Integration for Paper 2**: Students need to understand how to study current affairs for sociology paper
  - Approach current affairs through newspaper reading
  - Categorize news items into broad sociological topics
  - Make brief notes linking current events to syllabus topics

**Key Categories for Current Affairs Integration:**

- Caste and untouchability related news
- Women-related issues (family, position of women, patriarchy, violence, feminist movements)
- Tribal society issues 
- Religion, secularism, communalism, religious minorities
- Rural development, villages, farmers
- Environment and ecology
- Urban development and problems

## M.N. SRINIVAS: Overview and Significance (32:31)

- **Academic Stature**: Regarded as one of the tallest figures in Indian sociology and anthropology
- **Influence**: Very far-reaching impact; concepts have become part of regular terminology
- **Recognition**: Frequently referenced in UPSC interviews for technical sociology questions
- **Key Contribution**: Concept of SANSKRITIZATION is widely known across academia

### SRINIVAS's Critique of Previous Approaches

- **Complex Phenomenon View**: For SRINIVAS, caste is a very complex phenomenon that cannot be reduced to any single variable
- **Criticism of DUMONT**: DUMONT focused only on ritual aspects and ideology of pure-impure, wrongly de-emphasizing the role of wealth and power
- **Criticism of Marxist Analysis**: Also critical of those who reduce caste analysis to class (economic factors only)
- **Balanced Approach**: According to SRINIVAS, both ritual hierarchy and secular hierarchy are important and not independent of each other

## Concept of SANSKRITIZATION (38:51)

### Definition and Core Mechanism

- **Basic Process**: When a low caste acquires wealth and power, it may attempt SANSKRITIZATION to improve its ritual rank
- **Driving Force**: Discrepancy between high secular status and low ritual status creates motivation for SANSKRITIZATION

**The Process:**

- **Trigger**: Low caste community acquires substantial wealth and power
- **Feeling of Disconnect**: Community experiences mismatch between economic/political position and social respect
- **Response**: Community attempts to capture higher rank in ritual hierarchy through SANSKRITIZATION

### Key Characteristics of SANSKRITIZATION

- **Not Guaranteed**: SANSKRITIZATION may or may not result in higher ritual rank
- **Depends on Others**: Success depends on other castes accepting the claims to higher ritual status
- **Complex Situation**: It's not a given that wealth and power automatically translate to ritual elevation

### Relationship with Varna System

- **Reinforcement Not Weakening**: SANSKRITIZATION does not weaken the varna system; instead it strengthens and reinforces it
- **No Structural Change**: Process leads only to positional change, not structural changes in society
- **Testimony to Belief**: SANSKRITIZATION is testimony to lower caste belief in varna hierarchy

**Impact Analysis:**

- Structure remains the same
- No replacement of caste structure by class structure
- Only minor positional adjustments within existing hierarchy

### Historical Example: COHN's Study

- **Location**: COHN studied MADHOPURA village in UTTAR PRADESH
- **Subject**: Members of CHAMAR caste had undergone SANSKRITIZATION

**Changes Observed:**

- Earlier pig sacrifice during marriage was stopped
- Started availing services of Brahmin priest during marriage
- Started asking for dowry
- Regularly going on pilgrimages
- Performing puja and arti

## SANSKRITIZATION and WESTERNIZATION Relationship (57:17)

### SRINIVAS's Argument: Complementary Processes

- **Not Halted**: SANSKRITIZATION is not halted due to WESTERNIZATION
- **Facilitation**: WESTERNIZATION in several ways promotes and facilitates SANSKRITIZATION

**How WESTERNIZATION Facilitates SANSKRITIZATION:**

1. **Technology Adoption**:
   
   - Printing press technology resulted in Sanskrit literature reaching masses including lower castes
   - Televisualization spreads scriptural knowledge to masses

2. **Constitutional Values**:
   
   - Western values like equality led to temples being thrown open to all castes
   - Lower castes can now visit holy places and temples

3. **Transportation Revolution**:
   
   - Railways made pilgrimage cheaper, quicker, and easier for lower castes

4. **Cultural Vacuum Theory**:
   
   - Higher castes went for WESTERNIZATION first
   - This created cultural vacuum which could be filled by lower castes in Sanskrit culture
   - Less aggressive protection of Sanskrit culture by higher castes as they pursue Western aspirations

### Sequential Pattern of Adoption

**Historical Sequence:**

1. **Higher Castes**: Among first communities to undergo WESTERNIZATION
2. **Cultural Shift**: As higher castes adopted Western culture and lifestyle
3. **Reduced Resistance**: Lower castes found it easier to undergo SANSKRITIZATION as they faced lesser resistance from higher castes

## Concept of DOMINANT CASTE (89:55)

### SRINIVAS's Study: RAMPURA Village

- **Three Broad Categories** found in the village:
  - Brahmins
  - Non-Brahmin peasant castes  
  - Untouchable castes

**Key Finding**: Non-Brahmin peasant castes were dominant in village affairs, not Brahmins

### Factors Contributing to Dominant Caste Status

**Economic Factors:**

- Ownership of arable land
- Cattle ownership

**Political Power:**

- Control over village panchayat
- Connections with political parties
- Government jobs (especially village patwari - land record keeper)

**Social Capital:**

- Modern education
- City-based jobs
- Numerical strength (important for voting and muscle power)

### Relationship Between Ritual Purity and Dominance

- **Not Decisive**: Ritual purity alone does not ensure dominance
- **Facilitating Factor**: High ritual rank makes it easier for a caste to become dominant
- **Higher Chances**: Chances of becoming dominant are higher if caste is not too lowly placed in ritual hierarchy

**Interconnected Dominance**: If a caste acquires dominance in one dimension, it becomes easier to acquire dominance in other dimensions

### Examples of Dominant Castes Across India

| State                    | Dominant Castes                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uttar Pradesh            | AHIR (YADAV), JATS, GUJARS, RAJPUTS (collectively called AJGAR) |
| Andhra Pradesh/Telangana | KAMMAS and REDDYS                                               |
| Rajasthan                | RAJPUTS, MARWARIS, GUJARS                                       |
| Maharashtra              | MARATHAS, KUNBIS                                                |
| Bihar                    | YADAVS, RAJPUTS, BHUMIHARS                                      |
| Gujarat                  | PATIDARS (PATELS)                                               |
| Tamil Nadu               | VANNIYARS                                                       |
| Kerala                   | NAIRS                                                           |
| Karnataka                | LINGAYATS, GOWDAS                                               |

### Functions of Dominant Castes

**Village Control:**

- Control village affairs and village panchayat
- Settle disputes and dispense justice

**Representation:**

- Become the face of the village
- Represent village in interactions with outsiders
- Villages often known by dominant caste name (e.g., "this is a JAT village")

**State Interface:**

- Become conduit between villagers and state/government
- Facilitate development projects in village
- Ensure village development (wells, roads, schools)

## Criticisms of SRINIVAS's Concepts (110:38)

### Criticisms of SANSKRITIZATION

**1. Limited Empirical Base (POCOCK's Criticism)**:

- Based on study of one village in Karnataka
- Generalized concept for entire India with over 6 lakh villages
- Critics argue SRINIVAS doesn't take into account diversity present across India's villages

**2. Elite Emulation Interpretation**:

- SRINIVAS presents SANSKRITIZATION as elite emulation
- HALD GOLD argues it should be interpreted as protest and defiance
- According to GOLD, it's challenging monopoly of higher castes over cultural markers

**3. Regional Variations (CHANDANA's Study)**:

- In Punjab, Islamic culture provided model for elite emulation, not Sanskrit culture
- Shows SANSKRITIZATION pattern not universal across India

**4. Opposite Process (D.N. MAJUMDAR)**:

- More de-SANSKRITIZATION happening than SANSKRITIZATION
- Higher castes giving up elements of Sanskrit culture
- Example: Many Kashmiri Pandits have given up traditional dress and customs, started pursuing occupations of lower castes

**5. Contemporary Challenges (KANCHA ILAIAH SHEPHERD)**:

- DALITIZATION happening instead of SANSKRITIZATION
- Elements of Dalit culture being popularly adopted even by higher castes
- Examples: Increased alcohol consumption, meat consumption, beef consumption among higher castes

**6. Contradictory Forces**:

- WESTERNIZATION and SANSKRITIZATION work in opposite directions
- WESTERNIZATION reduces salience of Sanskrit culture
- Clear contradiction which SRINIVAS refuses to acknowledge

### Criticisms of DOMINANT CASTE Concept

**1. Borrowed Concept (POCOCK)**:

- SRINIVAS copied concept from African studies
- Replaced "tribe" with "caste" from his teachers' work on dominant tribes/lineages in Africa

**2. Over-emphasis on Numbers (D.N. MAJUMDAR)**:

- SRINIVAS over-emphasizes numerical strength
- Numerical strength not sufficient for dominance
- Throughout history, numerical minorities have dominated majorities

**3. Outdated Concept**:

- After independence and abolition of zamindari system, no single caste enjoys decisive dominance
- Land reforms changed land ownership patterns
- Different castes have different advantages (land, education, numbers, ritual status)

**4. Family vs. Caste Focus**:

- Critics argue dominance lies with dominant families, not entire castes
- Not all members of supposedly dominant caste are actually dominant

## SRINIVAS's Final Assessment: "An Obituary of Caste as a System" (117:39)

### Historical Context of Caste Resilience

- **Millennial Survival**: Caste system survived attacks for thousands of years
- **Previous Challenges**: Buddhism, Jainism, Bhakti movement, Sikhism all challenged Brahmanical supremacy and caste hierarchy
- **Robustness**: Despite powerful criticisms, caste system didn't die

### The Contemporary Collapse

**Cause of Current Decline**: Disintegration of JAJMANI system

- **Economic Backbone**: JAJMANI system provided economic backbone of caste system
- **System Logic**: Caste as system made sense because of JAJMANI exchange
- **Modern Weakening**: With modernization, JAJMANI system systematically weakened to point of disintegration

### Impact of Modernization on JAJMANI System

**Process Changes:**

- Production system freed of caste-based division of labor
- Economic exchange became autonomous
- Grain payments replaced by cash payments
- Cash-based, market-based exchange replaced traditional exchange

**Technological Disruption:**

- Modern technologies introduced since British times
- Many traditional JAJMANI occupations died or significantly declined
- Examples: Oil production moved from oil pressers to oil mills and factories; soap/detergents reduced reliance on washermen (dhobis); razor blades reduced role of barbers

**Occupational Transformation:**

- Many traditional occupations literally vanished
- Earthen pots replaced by plastic products
- Economic foundation of caste system eroded

### The Paradox: System vs. Identity

**SRINIVAS's Final Conclusion:**

- **Caste as System**: Dying
- **Caste as Identity**: Thriving

**Historical Development (1920s onward):**

- Various castes started organizing and forming caste-based associations
- People started seeking votes along caste lines
- Caste became tool for competing for scarce resources (government jobs, educational opportunities)
- People organizing along caste lines to secure legislative power

## ANDRE BETEILLE: Caste Decline in Modern India (146:41)

### Academic Background and Recognition

- **Mixed Heritage**: Father French, mother Bengali Brahmin
- **Recognition**: Termed "wisest man in India" by historian RAMACHANDRA GUHA
- **Positions**: National Professor, member of National Knowledge Commission under MANMOHAN SINGH government
- **Career Start**: Delhi School of Economics

### Initial Academic Environment

**Economist Colleagues' View (1960s-70s):**

- Caste belongs to India's past
- No place in modern progressive India being carved by Nehru state
- Caste is dead and dying social institution
- Being replaced rapidly by class
- Focus should be on economic factors, not caste

**Lone Voice**: M.N. SRINIVAS was sole crusader highlighting importance of caste in post-independence modern India

### BETEILLE's Retrospective Analysis

**Who Was Right?**

- **BETEILLE's Conclusion**: Economists were right about caste decline
- **Evidence**: Caste suffered serious setback and significantly declined in three key areas of social life

### Three Key Areas of Caste Decline

#### 1. Occupation-Caste Linkage (154:46)

**Traditional Pattern:**

- Caste names were occupational categories
- Occupational specification even at sub-caste level
- Strong linkage between caste identity and occupation

**Modern Changes:**

- Several caste-free occupations emerged with modernization and industrialization
- Examples: What is caste of computer engineer? Pilot? Social media influencer?
- People across castes competing for modern occupations
- Very few among current generation pursuing traditional caste occupations

**Weakening Process:**

- Caste-occupation linkage greatly weakened
- Most families not pursuing traditional caste-based occupations
- Caste-occupation linkage effectively severed in modern Indian society

#### 2. Food and Water Exchange Rules (158:35)

**Traditional Rules:**

- Maintaining physical distance to prevent pollution
- Following rules governing exchange of food and water
- Central to caste system maintenance

**Urban Changes:**

- In restaurants, college canteens, office canteens: people giving and accepting food irrespective of caste
- People of various castes sitting together and eating
- If you try to observe caste rules in urban settings, you will be mocked
- People unmindful of caste in urban social settings

**Transportation Impact:**

- Urban transport: almost exchanging bodily fluids in metro and buses irrespective of caste
- Unmindful of caste of fellow travelers

**Rural Areas:**

- Even in rural areas, significant decline in following these rules
- People casually exchanging food items across castes
- Taking groceries from stores irrespective of shopkeeper's caste

#### 3. Marriage Patterns (163:08)

**Continued Caste Consciousness:**

- Most marriages still within caste
- BETEILLE acknowledges this reality

**Relative Changes:**

- Number of inter-caste marriages has increased significantly
- People view inter-caste marriage simply as "inter-caste" without traditional distinctions
- Students don't know difference between ANULOMA and PRATILOMA marriages
- Circle of endogamy has widened (marriages within broader caste categories rather than sub-castes)

**Changing Criteria:**

- Criteria other than caste becoming important: wealth, educational background
- Attitudes toward inter-caste marriage changing
- Earlier: community punishment; Now: mainly family-level resistance
- Wider community not getting invested in maintaining caste endogamy

### Overall Assessment

**BETEILLE's Conclusion**: Economists were right when they pointed out caste becoming increasingly irrelevant in modern Indian society. All three areas - occupation, food/water rules, and marriage - show significant decline in caste salience.
