# Religion in Modern Society

## Introduction and Festival Greetings (18:19)

- Hi friends, happy Raksha Bandhan

## Recap of Previous Theories - Marxist and Weberian (19:46)

### Marxist Theory of Religion

- **Religion is the opium of the masses**: Religion is a part of the superstructure that legitimizes the inequality in the economy
- Religion explains the social order as sanctioned by divinity
- Religion makes virtue out of suffering, poverty and disprivilege
- According to MARX, religion supports the interests of the haves
- Religion is far from a Marxist perspective - it's an eyewash
- In rough language, religion hoodwinks or cheats the poor into believing that this world is created by God
- In a communist society, there will be no religion - Communist society will be a religionless society
- As long as you have class inequalities, you need religion to legitimize them, justify them

### Weberian Theory of Religion

- **WEBER** explains how protestant religious beliefs help to develop the spirit of capitalism
- **Spirit of capitalism**: Relentless pursuit of profit and more and more profit
- **Work ethic required**: WEBER quotes from BENJAMIN FRANKLIN - honesty, wealth accumulation, industry, frugality, austerity, respecting time, respecting credit
- **Protestant work ethic**: For Catholics, holidays became holidays or cessation from productive activity so that they could devote themselves in singing the praise of the Lord. But for the Protestants, work is worship
- WEBER's views were profoundly influenced by what he saw at home, particularly his very devout and austere lifestyle leading mother

## Religion in Modern Society - General Observations (27:16)

### Initial Assessment

- What has happened to religion as the society has changed from a premodern traditional agrarian type to a modern industrial capitalist type?
- Can we broadly say that religion has somewhat declined in importance in social life?
- Would you agree that we today are comparatively far less religious than our forefathers?
- Student observations:
  - You started questioning rituals etc. while possibly your grandmother followed them very diligently
  - You have a rational approach to religion
  - Many of us today question religions or do not consider religious rituals to be sensical
  - During Durga puja they used to fast religiously for 10 days, used to avoid doing work at night
  - Parents were not open to intercaste marriages or interreligious marriages, but current generation is relatively more open
  - Grandparents used to make personal life choices on the basis of religion - strictly vegetarian, no intoxicants
  - Economic system - we have to devote more time in workplace, more focused on work rather than these rituals
  - Their morality or science of right and wrong was based on religion

## Concept of Secularization (29:29)

### Definition

- **Secularization**: According to BRIAN WILSON, secularization is a social process whereby religious beliefs, thinking, religious thinking and religious practices lose their social significance
- It is widely believed that in premodern society, religion played a central role in social life
- However, the rise of modern industrial society has been accompanied by secularization

### What is Secularization in Essence

- The decline in the importance, decline in the popularity of religion in the society
- Earlier people were more religious while in modern society people in general are far less religious

## Factors Contributing to Secularization (41:04)

### Growth of Science

- **The biggest nail in the coffin of religion is the rise of science**
- As scientific knowledge has expanded, the domain of religion has receded
- As scientific knowledge expands, the need to rely upon religion reduces
- As science answers more and more questions for man, he seeks less and less answers to those questions from religion
- Examples:
  - If we did not know how rainfall takes place, we attributed it to the mood swings of INDRA
  - Now we know rainfall is an outcome of evaporation, condensation, cloud formation, precipitation
  - Small pox, chickenpox - modern medicine offers greater chances of relief than religious remedies
  - Cloud seeding will work more likely than havan for INDRA

### COMTE's Three Stages Theory

- **COMTE** suggested that society passes through three stages:
  1. **Theological stage**: Answers to questions of man are religious or theological in character
  2. **Metaphysical stage**: The answers become somewhat abstract and philosophical  
  3. **Positive/Scientific stage**: Finally replaced by scientific knowledge
- This was according to COMTE a universal law of social evolution

### WEBER's Rationalization

- **Rationalization**: We become increasingly rational in terms of our action choices, in terms of our thought processes
- Based on reason rather than tradition or religion
- Modernization is accompanied by rationalization meaning rational action becomes the dominant form of action
- **Disenchantment of the world**: Demystification - earlier man used to remain enchanted or in a sense of awe wonder
- In modern society there is no more mystery, no more belief in the supernatural, no sense of magic or wonder
- Modern man greatly relies upon calculability

### MARX on Religion in Communist Society

- According to MARX, religion is a part of the superstructure which justifies the inequalities in the base
- In a communist society there will be no religion
- As long as you have class inequalities, you need religion to legitimize them, justify them
- But in a classless communist society, there will be no religion

## Evidence of Secularization (75:05)

### Statistical Evidence

#### PEW Research (2010)

- Globally, there were about 1.1 billion people who considered themselves to be atheists, agnostics or those who do not identify with any religion
- This is approximately 15-16% of the world's population

#### GALLUP Poll Evidence

- According to a GALLUP poll in 2021, 21% American citizens identified with no religion, up from a meager 1% in 1951
- 2022 figures remain same - 21% US citizens identified with no religion

#### European Statistics (EUROBAROMETER Survey)

- People who reported no religious beliefs:
  - France: 40%
  - Czech Republic: 37% 
  - Sweden: 34%
  - Germany: 27%

#### China Statistics

- A WIN GALLUP poll survey of 2012 suggested that about 47% people in China are atheists
- Though this could be due to government sanction or fear of government as it's a communist regime

### STEVE BRUCE's Factors

#### Structural Differentiation

- **Structural differentiation**: In premodern societies, different structures were overlapping and now specialized structures have emerged for different performance of different functions
- Example: In premodern society, the priestly class would also serve as advisers to the king - they had a political administrative role
- But in modern societies, religion has become separate, priests have become separate from advisers to the ruling classes
- Earlier religion was very closely connected with other things, now it is not
- So its influence in other areas of life has reduced

#### Societalization

- **Societalization**: Earlier people used to live in small-sized communities which were very close-knit
- Nowadays, with modernization, people live in modern states, nation states which are very large-sized societies
- Community is replaced by society - close knit community is replaced by a large scale society
- In large scale societies, large scale bureaucratic organizations conduct the affairs
- Religion thrives in close-knit communities because people assemble together and the church plays an important role in community affairs
- In modern large scale societies, it is bureaucratic organizations who play the important role
- Example: Earlier namakarana ceremony when child was born - local community would gather in temple, priest would perform rituals and name would be chosen. Now hospital authorities insist you give them a name before leaving hospital for MCD records and birth certificate

#### Individualism

- According to STEVE BRUCE, the process of societalization contributes to the decline of religion in society
- Societalization means that the small-scale close-knit communities in which people earlier lived, have now been replaced by very large sized modern states
- While the church played an important role in community affairs, modern states are governed by large impersonal rational bureaucratic organizations

### Decline in Church Attendance

- **Important evidence**: Steady decline in the footfalls in the churches particularly in Europe
- There has been a very steady decline in church attendance in Europe
- Many churches have been forced to shut down while others have converted into or put to other uses like libraries or museums
- Many massive imposing structures built in medieval era which were churches have been turned into libraries, museums, or places of tourist interest because of lack of patronage or visitors with a religious bent
- Examples in India: AJANTA, ELLORA, KHAJURAHO which were earlier basically places of worship, now they are places of secular tourist visits

### Disengagement

- **Disengagement**: The decline in the role of church (organized religion) in other social spheres has greatly reduced
- The role of formal organized religion or church in other social spheres has greatly reduced
- As structural differentiation has taken place, disengagement of religion from other social spheres has also taken place

#### Examples of Disengagement:

**State and Religion:**

- Earlier church and the state were closely connected or religion and government were very intimately connected
- Many kings derived their legitimacy from divine sanction as representatives of god
- The priestly class would conduct havans etc to give legitimacy to the authority of the king
- Now the close relationship between the state and religion has been broken
- A wall of separation has been erected between state and church - that wall is known as secularism
- Modern constitutional legal framework is secularized or not derived from religion

**Education:**

- In premodern societies, religious instruction was imparted by the education system
- The priestly class controlled the dissemination of knowledge  
- In modern societies, you are being taught scientific knowledge, secularized forms of knowledge - physics, chemistry, history, sociology
- Knowledge dissemination today in modern nations is not in the hands of the priestly class

**Economic Activity:**

- In premodern India, which occupation I pursue was determined by religion or caste
- I would perform an occupation in accordance with the teachings of my religion
- In modern societies we pursue occupations irrespective of religious sanction
- We are all pursuing caste-free modern occupations
- The close control of religion over occupation or economy has been broken

**Art and Architecture:**

- Earlier a lot of architecture was built around religious themes - magnificent statues of deities, places of worship, churches, cathedrals, mandirs
- In arts - music, dance, drama - themes earlier revolved around divinity, gods, religion
- Now music produced by entertainment industry is on non-religious themes like love
- Drama, TV serials, movies are not of a religious character

### Religious Pluralism

- **Religious pluralism**: In premodern societies, societies were largely homogeneous in terms of their religious composition - mono-religious societies
- All people in small scale communities would have the same religious beliefs and practices
- Modern societies are increasingly multi-religious - several religious groups, belief systems present within the same society
- When there is only one religion present, it can successfully claim the monopoly over the religious truth
- When you have multiple religions present, there are competing belief systems which weakens the hold of religion on people's minds
- In a mono-religious society, collective conscience is strong - people have same set of beliefs, thinking patterns
- In a multi-religious society, what one religion says may compete and clash with the teachings of other religions
- Example: As a practicing Hindu, I worship the cow as sacred, but my Muslim friend does not believe in the sacredness of the cow

### Proliferation of Sects and Cults

- **Proliferation of sects and cults**: Relatively smaller religious groupings
- In modern societies, sects and cults are the last refuge of the religiously inclined in a largely secularized society
- In a pre-religious society, the society as a whole is religious minded, so people can seek answers to their religious or spiritual questions in the wider society itself
- In modern societies, the wider society, mainstream society is uninterested in religion
- Because the wider society has lost interest in religion, those who do still have a religious quest are flocking to these sects and cults in large numbers

### Secularization of the Church Itself

- **WILL HERBERG**: Church itself has got secularized - organized religion has itself become secularized
- Churches in Europe were going empty but in equally modern American society, churches were full
- HERBERG explains this as secularization of the church itself - church or organized religion itself is changing, becoming non-religious in character
- In the US, instead of giving religious sermons, church officials started delivering motivational speeches on how to become successful
- Religious organizations are themselves becoming secularized as the society is secularizing
- Example: BABA RAMDEV - hugely popular Hindu religious figure, but does he sell religion? His main selling plank is health and nationalism
- Religious organizations have changed their offerings as per the demands of a largely secularized society

### Decline During Life Crisis Events

- **Life crisis events**: Earlier various important life crisis events were surrounded with a lot of religious activity, rituals, fervor - birth of child, puberty, marriage, death
- Marriages were primarily conducted in places of worship - churches, temples
- Now marriages are conducted in five-star hotels, banquet halls, pandals, anywhere but a temple
- The religious component of a Hindu marriage has been greatly reduced
- Typical marriage now starts with cocktail, dance on vulgar filmy songs, bachelor parties, reception with elaborate spread
- During the time of religious ceremonies, not more than 20 people present out of 2,000 guests
- Religious fervor, activities and rituals surrounding major life crisis events have been given up, shortened, or replaced by their secular avatars
- Puberty related rituals have been largely given up
- 16 important Hindu rituals (SAMSKARAS) associated with different life stages have been shortened or abandoned
- Moving towards electric furnaces for death ceremonies away from traditional ways

### Secularization of Religious Festivals

- **Religious festivities and rituals have been greatly secularized**
- During religious festivals people do not engage in religious activities - the religious significance of the festival is lost
- **DIWALI example**: How do we celebrate Diwali? We have card parties, gambling parties starting a month before Diwali
- **HOLI example**: Similar secularization has occurred
- Religion has greatly reduced in its social significance even during religious festivities
- **Christmas in the West**: Has been reduced to a shopping festival
- **Diwali**: Has been reduced to a shopping festival - "Diwali Dhamaka offers"
- The religiosity has faded away even from religious festivities

## Secularization in India (105:44)

### General Observations about India

- Student observations:
  - In urban areas, urban elites have become secularized but in villages religion thrives
  - Religion has not completely vanished from Indian social life - lots of temples, people visiting more due to ease of transport
  - Earlier elaborate rituals have been shortened
  - People seldom go to temples and mosques due to modern lifestyle and work pressures

### M.N. SRINIVAS on Indian Secularization

- **M.N. SRINIVAS**: One of the big daddies of Indian sociology
- Quote: "Today there is little religion in the day-to-day life of an average Indian"
- He wrote this several decades back, suggesting Indian society has undergone secularization
- **According to SRINIVAS, secularization means that what was previously regarded as religious is ceasing to be so**
- **Secularization also involves a process of differentiation so that various aspects of society - economic, political and religious - become separated from each other**

### Factors Contributing to Secularization in India

#### Modern Education

- Has fostered a scientific temperament, a rational outlook

#### Social Religious Reforms

- Contributed to secularization by pointing out various social evils associated with religion
- Such as sati, child marriage, etc.

#### Movements Critical of Religion

- **AMBEDKAR**: Extremely critical of Hinduism
- **PERIYAR**: Leader of the self-respect movement in Tamil Nadu, very critical of religion in general, Hinduism in particular  
- **JYOTIRAO PHULE**: Before AMBEDKAR, was very critical of Hinduism

#### Constitutional and Legal Framework

- Introducing the notion of secularism - distancing law and constitution from religion
- Prohibiting certain religious practices: untouchability, sati
- Changing conventional position of women in Hindu society
- Recent bans on triple talaq
- Throwing open places of worship to sections conventionally barred entry
- Legal constitutional measures, judicial pronouncements all contribute to secularization

#### Urbanization and Industrialization

- **Urbanization**: People from different religious communities live together in compact spaces, high population density areas
- Different religious groups staying together results in religious pluralism
- **Industrialization**: Gives rise to many caste-free occupations which people start pursuing irrespective of their caste
- The role of religion or hold of religion in economic affairs declines
- What is the caste of a civil engineer or IT engineer? There is no caste
- With industrialization, a large number of caste-free occupations have arisen

#### Spread of Scientific Temperament and Rationality

- It was the stated policy of the Nehruvian state to spread scientific temperament
- The spread of scientific temper was part of the policy of the Nehruvian state
- As scientific temperament and rationality have spread, religion has receded

#### Mass Media

- Earlier various facets of social life were governed by religion - what clothes to wear was determined by religion
- Religious figures would provide role models for emulation
- Lower castes would imitate the lifestyle, dress, eating habits of higher castes
- In modern society, do I imitate the Brahmin style of dressing? Whom do I imitate? Film stars like SALMAN KHAN
- They are the new cultural icons providing models for emulation
- Mass media affects large numbers of people in terms of food habits, dressing patterns

### Hindu Society's Susceptibility to Secularization

- **SRINIVAS** has written that Hindu society is more susceptible to the forces of secularization than other religious communities in India

#### Reasons for Hindu Susceptibility:

**No Single Book or Way of Life:**

- In Hinduism there is no single book or single way of life
- Multiple religious philosophies within Hinduism
- Both formless and with form concepts of God exist in Hinduism
- Hindus who believe in sanctity of Vedas and those who don't are equally Hindu
- No one God, no one philosophy, no one way of life in Hinduism
- Within Hinduism, there is a lot of diversity of philosophies, puja methods, modes of worship, deities, scriptures

**More Liberal and Open-minded:**

- Because of diversity, Hindu society is more cosmopolitan, liberal, accepting of diversity
- You can't have "my way or the highway" kind of thing in Hinduism
- If I worship MATA RANI and you worship GANESH JI or you are a Shaivite, are you any less Hindu? Clearly no

**Long History of Being Challenged:**

- Hinduism has a very long history of being continuously questioned and challenged
- More than 2,000 years back, Buddhism and Jainism arose questioning the prevailing Hindu social order
- They rose up against Brahminical control over Hinduism
- Later several bhakti saints, Sikhism, various social religious reform movements of modern era - ARYA SAMAJ, BRAHMO SAMAJ
- Hinduism has developed a very long history of being continuously challenged and questioned

**Demographic Majority Status:**

- Being the numerically preponderant, demographically Hindus are preponderant
- Being the demographic majority in India, Hindus are more open to reform, questioning and change
- Religious minorities tend to cling to their religious beliefs and customs far more strongly simply to preserve their culture
- Majority tends to be more comfortable and reassured of its place in society

**Student Observations on Hindu-Muslim Differences:**

- Hindus don't have a particular rule book, multiple religious scriptures
- Hindu reform movements - Indian state interfered more in Hindu affairs than Muslim affairs
- Many subgroups in Hindu culture, lot of diversity
- Caste system exploitation - people want to get away from oppressive religious system
- British influence for long time - westernization, modernization became ideals
- Multiple gods in Hinduism - people confused which god to follow or none at all
- Islam is monotheistic so people have greater clarity
- Muslims have madrasas, gurukul system of Hindus done away with
- Early religious socialization leaves deep imprint - Muslim child exposed to religious scriptures early, Hindu child not as much

## Criticisms of Secularization (153:29)

### Problem of Measurement

- **How do you measure religiosity?**
- We don't have any sound standardized quantifiable units of measurement of religiosity
- Then how can we say that religion has declined?
- To assess decline of religiosity, a similar survey should have been conducted 40 years back, 100 years back, 300 years back
- If you want to compare decline with modernization, then in premodern society a similar survey should have been conducted, which is rarely available

#### Issues with Historical Records:

- **Church attendance records**: Churches have old records capturing number of people attending, but measurement techniques have evolved
- In premodern society, measurement methods were very crude - physical registers
- Nowadays far more sophisticated methods like biometric devices
- How do you compare the two?
- Today we have far more sophisticated, reliable devices to capture attendance than earlier

#### Non-Religious Factors for Church Attendance:

- **Church attendance may have declined due to other non-religious factors**
- In medieval Europe, people went to church not necessarily because they were religious but due to social respectability
- Going to church was considered a sign of middle class respectability or high social status
- In modern times, churchgoing is no more considered a signifier of high social status
- High social status today is more associated with possessions - purchasing an iPhone is greater signifier than regular church visits
- Church attendance was not necessarily an indicator of religiosity in medieval times

### Religion Has Become Individualized

- **BERGER and LUCKMANN**: People have reduced going to church because religion has become individualized
- Religion has become a private affair, earlier it was more of a community affair
- Just because people don't go to places of worship doesn't mean they are not religious
- **LUCKMANN's "Invisible Religion"**: Religion has become invisible from the public sphere but is very much part of personal/private life of the individual

### Modern Societies Still Religious

#### American Society Example:

- **Modern American society is a very religious society**
- **Christian values are the foundation of American society**
- What we today regard as American values are really Christian values
- Christianity, Christian values have been generalized or Americanized
- Example: America greatly values human life - each life is highly valued
- This sanctity associated with human life derives from the Holy Bible, from Christianity
- Christian values have been generalized and taken the form of American values

#### Civil Religion:

- **Has religion vanished or changed form?**
- Old sacreds have been replaced by new sacreds
- In modern society there is clear distinction between sacred and profane
- New sacreds continue to bind people together, provide shared morality
- Traditional religions may have declined but they have been replaced by modern new civic religion

### Questioning the Premodern Religious Man Image

- **Critics suggest we have no proof that premodern man was far more religious than modern man**
- This image of premodern man that we have created in our modern minds may simply be the imagination of modern man
- The notion that each aspect of his life was governed by religion, that he spent lot of time concerned with religion, gave authority to priestly class
- **Perhaps just like in our lives, religion is one of the very many aspects of our lives, possibly also for the premodern man**
- This whole notion that premodern man was very religious while modern man is not may simply be the figment of modern man's imagination
- Perhaps premodern man was not as religious and primitive as the modern man thinks
