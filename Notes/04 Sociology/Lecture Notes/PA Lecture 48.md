# Work and Economic Life

## Introduction to Work and Economic Life (24:49)

- Today we are moving on to the next unit which is **Work and Economic Life**
- Throughout our syllabus in various places we have at great length discussed work and economic life
- **MARX's** whole theory focuses on changes in work and economy and how that is a driver of social change
- **DURKHEIM's** theory of division of labor - what were we discussing? The changing nature of work
- **WEBER's** theory of Protestant ethic and the rise of capitalism - what were we discussing? Changing nature of work
- Even in emergence of sociology when we discussed Industrial Revolution - what are we discussing? Work and economic life
- **WEBER's** bureaucracy - the bureaucracy exists at the workplace
- While you are writing answers, don't look at content in silos and compartmentalized
- Whatever we have studied under MARX we can bring it here
- Whatever we have studied under WEBER's bureaucracy and so on and so forth
- **DURKHEIM's** theory of division of labor we can and should bring it here

## UPSC Syllabus Topics for Work and Economic Life (36:01)

The topics mentioned under the unit of Work and Economic Life are as follows:

1. **Social organization of work in different types of societies** - namely slave society, feudal society and industrial society
2. **Formal and informal organization of work**
3. **Labor and society**

## Definition of Work (38:23)

### What is Work?

- **Work**: Performing any task which produces something of utility for the society
- **Work**: Performing some role in the society to sustain one's own life
- **Commonly understood meaning of work**: Work is that for which we are paid. If you are not paid for something then it will not be regarded as work

- **In a narrow sense**: Work refers to only paid employment outside the home
- **However, a broader definition of work**: Also includes unpaid domestic work and volunteer work

### Feminist Critique of Narrow Definition

- Feminist scholarship would object to such an understanding of work

### Comparison Between Slave Society and Feudal Society (81:08)

| Aspect                  | Slave Society                                                             | Feudal Society                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classes**             | Masters and slaves                                                        | Lords and serfs                                                                 |
| **Production System**   | Plantation work and basic agriculture with rudimentary technology         | Advanced agriculture with greater control over water bodies                     |
| **Status of Workers**   | Slaves were considered as chattel - property owned by masters             | Serfs were not property of lords, they served the lords but were not owned      |
| **Subsistence**         | Slaves were given basic subsistence irrespective of quantum of production | Serfs were given a share of the produce - share cropping                        |
| **Incentive System**    | No incentive to produce more                                              | Inbuilt incentive for serfs to produce more                                     |

### How Slavery System Worked (91:10)

- **Origin**: As populations grew, different hunting tribes came in contact and clashed with each other for control over natural resources
- **Prisoner creation**: The losing tribe members were taken as prisoners of war and converted into slaves by the winning tribe
- **Reproduction prohibition**: To ensure that numbers of a particular tribe do not become too much, prohibitions would be placed on reproduction
- **Acquiring more slaves**: Through more warfare and then subjugating/capturing the defeated tribes
- **Uncertainty factor**: In tribal inter-tribal warfare there is no guarantee of success, so there is a lot of uncertainty involved in procuring new slaves

### Feudalism Improvements (92:44)

- **New serfs procurement**: Through reproduction - which does not involve any sort of warfare and violence
- **Control mechanism**: Through ideological control where organized religion or centralized church type organization plays a very important role
- **Religious control**: Used to ideologically condition and control the serfs and have-nots

## Management (103:27)

### What is Management?

- **Management function**: Control, arranging/organizing resources of the organization
- **Comprehensive definition (POSDCORB)**: Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Directing, Coordinating, Reporting and Budgeting
- **Provided by**: GULICK and URWICK
- **Core purpose**: Ensuring optimal utilization of the limited resources of the organization

### Is Management a Science or Art? (107:11)

**Arguments for Science:**

- Based on empirical data
- Can have certain laws
- Can be quantified and measured

**Arguments for Art:**

- Some people are born managers
- Requires people skills which is subjective
- Cannot have one principle governing all social human interactions
- Requires innate skill and talent

## Scientific Management - FREDERICK TAYLOR (113:06)

### Background Context

- **Taylor's era**: About 20th century when industrial conflict was rife
- **Conflict situation**: Lot of conflict between workers and management
- **Workers seeking**: Higher wages, better work conditions, reduced work hours
- **Management seeking**: Greater profits, trying to depress wages
- **Industrial climate**: Very vitiated

### Core Principles of Scientific Management (118:03)

**TAYLOR considers that management is a science** and his theory is known as **Scientific Management** or **Taylorism**

#### Key Assumptions:

- **Before scientific management**: Management was viewed as an art, a unique skill that some people possess
- **Any decline in industrial production**: Was blamed on the workers
- **Workers were seen as**: Lazy, shirking work

#### Four Principles of Scientific Management (129:18):

1. **All parts of the job must be scientifically analyzed**
   
   - Large tasks should be broken down into smaller and simpler tasks

2. **Scientific selection of the workers should be carried out**
   
   - The most appropriate persons for a job must be selected
   - Match people's skills, capabilities and characteristics with the job requirements

3. **Scientific training of the workers**
   
   - Any training, skill upgradation which is required for efficiently performing the task has to be provided to the workers
   - This is management's responsibility

4. **Cooperation**
   
   - There must be regular and close cooperation between management and workers

### One Best Way Concept (134:44)

- **Scientific management considers that there is one best way** of performing any job
- **It is the responsibility of the management** to find out this most efficient way
- **Method**: Through time and motion studies
- **Time and motion studies**: Management will divide workers into teams, observe them with stopwatch, obtain empirical data through experiments, and figure out objectively which is the most efficient or best way to complete any given task
- **Training**: Then management will train the work force in that best way

### Expected Benefits (124:48)

**TAYLOR writes that scientific management serves the common interests** of management, workers and the society at large:

- **Aims to**: Increase production efficiency in the factory system
- **Can lead to**: Mental revolution in industry
- **Mental revolution means**: Instead of bickering over how to divide the pie, both will collaboratively focus upon increasing the size of the pie
- **Benefits for all stakeholders**:
  - Workers will take home higher wages
  - Management will have greater profits
  - Customers will benefit by lower prices
  - Improved efficiency, reduced waste

### Success and Opposition (140:43)

#### Success:

- **It was immensely successful** - a runaway success
- **TAYLOR became consultant** to steel plants who were loss-making units
- **Applied principles** and within a few months was able to turn around the fortune of these steel plants
- **HENRY FORD** was one of the first to successfully implement scientific management on large scale
- **Became governing mantra** of modern industry, widely applied across sectors
- **Massive increase in productivity** witnessed by the modern world

#### Opposition:

**Despite success, TAYLOR faced stiff opposition from both workers and management**

**Workers opposed because**:

- **Dehumanizing approach**: Reducing workers to a cog in the machine
- **Micro supervision and monitoring**: Very detailed control by management which was resented by workers
- **Time and motion studies**: Felt as intrusive and unwelcome

**Management opposed because**:

- **Earlier managers were prized**: Management was viewed as an art, those with the skill were highly paid
- **TAYLORISM reduced their importance**: Said management is a science, can be quantified and measured
- **Threatened their position**: Reduced the special status of managers

## Human Relations Approach - ELTON MAYO (146:47)

### Background - Hawthorne Studies (147:37)

- **Location**: Hawthorne plant/factory
- **Purpose**: Studies related to worker productivity
- **Initial focus**: Impact of physical work conditions on worker productivity
- **Physical work conditions studied**: Lighting, ventilation, temperature, rest breaks

### Key Findings of Hawthorne Studies (149:22)

#### Initial Experiments:

- **When lighting was bright and adequate**: Worker productivity was high
- **When workers were given adequate rest breaks**: Productivity was high
- **When proper temperature was maintained**: Worker productivity was high
- **When there was proper ventilation**: Worker productivity was high

#### Surprising Discovery:

- **When adverse conditions were created**: Worker productivity remained high
- **When lighting was dim**: Productivity remained high
- **When ventilation was not good**: Productivity remained high
- **When workers were not given adequate rest breaks**: Productivity remained high

#### Explanation - Hawthorne Effect (152:41):

- **Worker productivity remained high because**: The workers knew they were being observed
- **Hawthorne Effect**: In any experiment involving human beings, if the subjects know that they are the subject of an experiment, that will modify their behavior
- **Result**: The experiments were not able to establish any significant relationship between physical work conditions and worker productivity

### ELTON MAYO's Contributions (153:59)

#### Key Discovery:

- **Worker productivity is greatly dependent upon**: The nature of supervisory techniques which are employed

#### Supervision Impact:

- **If supervision was strict**: Top down, very hierarchical, one way communication - worker productivity was low
- **If supervision was friendly**: Communication was two way, if workers felt they had a say in the affairs of the organization - productivity was high

### Bank Wiring Experiment (156:41)

#### Purpose:

- **To gauge**: How workers respond to monetary incentives

#### Experiment Design:

- **Offered different kinds of incentive schemes**: Individual level incentives and group incentives
- **Positive incentives**: If you produce so much you will get this much more
- **Negative incentives**: If you do not produce this much, this much will be deducted from your wage

#### Surprising Results:

- **Workers did not seem to be responding** to monetary incentives of any kind
- **They continued to produce** as much as they were producing earlier - no more, no less
- **Irrespective of monetary incentives** that were offered

#### Key Discovery - Informal Organization (161:05):

- **In every formal organization there exists an informal organization**
- **Informal organization includes**:
  - Informal rules
  - Informal communication
  - Informal hierarchies
  - Informal relationships
- **These greatly affect** worker behavior and productivity

#### How Informal Organization Worked:

- **Among workers an understanding had developed**: We will all keep producing only this much - no more, no less
- **If any worker tried to produce more**: Other workers would pull him down through informal mechanisms (taunts, boycott, social pressure)
- **If any worker showed significant dip**: He was also subjected to criticisms and informal control mechanisms

### Impact of Human Relations Approach (164:29)

#### Practical Applications:

- **Management can harness informal organization**: By identifying informal leaders and bringing them to appreciate management's point of view
- **Need to acknowledge**: The informal organization first

#### Modern Workplace Impact:

- **All major modern organizations strive** to foster a more conducive work environment
- **Human Relations approach recognizes**: The human element in the work force
- **Workers are valued as human beings**: Not seen as cog in the machine
- **HR Departments**: Nearly all large scale modern corporations have HR departments
- **Focus on**: Making workplace friendly, worker friendly, comfortable
- **Activities include**: Team building exercises, retreats, grievance redressal mechanisms, regular feedback collection
