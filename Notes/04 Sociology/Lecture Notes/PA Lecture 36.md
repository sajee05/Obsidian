# Social Stratification: Theories and Dimensions

## Introduction and Theories of Social Stratification (16:13)

- **Social Stratification**: Hierarchical arrangement of social groups with regard to unequal distribution of power, property, prestige, and psychic gratifications
- Key dimensions include: **Power, Prestige, Property, and Psychic Gratification**

### Davis and Moore's Functional Theory of Stratification

- **Core Argument**: Stratification system performs an important functional prerequisite of effective role allocation and performance

- **Functions of Stratification**:
  
  - Helps society attract large numbers of people to functionally more important positions
  - Helps society select those who will be most competent for functionally more important jobs
  - Ensures that selected persons are adequately compensated for long periods of preparation and training
  - Ensures that people are sufficiently motivated to perform their respective roles diligently

- **Source**: Paper titled "Some Principles of Stratification" by Davis and Moore

### Melvin Tumin's Critique of Davis and Moore's Theory

- **Counter-arguments**:
  - Stratification divides society
  - There is no objective way of capturing which social role is more important
  - Talent pool in society may not be limited
  - Training period has its own reward, so high compensation may not be necessary or justified
  - Stratification system erects barriers in exploring talent in lower ranks of society
  - We may not be selecting the most competent persons for functionally more important jobs

### Functionalist Claim of Universality

- **Argument**: Stratification system is universal
- **Evidence**: Stratification was present even in kibbutzs and Eastern Bloc countries
- **Scholars who studied Eastern Bloc**: Frank Parkin and Milovan Djilas

## Weber's Theory of Social Stratification (24:21)

- Weber's analysis stands in stark contrast to Marxist analysis
- **Comparison Requirement**: For UPSC, compare views of Marx and Weber on stratification, class analysis, and capitalist society

### Weber's Understanding of Class vs Marx's Understanding

| Aspect                | Marx's View                                    | Weber's View                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Number of Classes** | Two main classes (Bourgeoisie and Proletariat) | Four main classes                                |
| **Basis of Class**    | Relationship with means of production          | Market situation                                 |
| **Class Definition**  | Ownership of production                        | What one offers to market and receives in return |

#### Weber's Four Classes in Capitalist Society

1. **Propertied Upper Class**
   
   - **Market Offering**: Capital and property
   - **Market Returns**: Profit and rental incomes

2. **White Collar Workers**
   
   - **Market Offering**: Expertise, high-level skills, managerial capability, administrative skills, long years of education
   - **Market Returns**: Salaries, professional fees
   - **Requirements**: Long periods of education (engineers, doctors, accountants, teachers)

3. **Petty Bourgeoisie**
   
   - **Market Offering**: Small amount of capital plus family labor
   - **Market Returns**: Small amount of profit

4. **Manual Working Class**
   
   - **Market Offering**: Labor power
   - **Market Returns**: Wages

### Key Differences: Marx vs Weber

| Aspect                     | Marx                                         | Weber                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class Polarization**     | Classes will polarize as capitalism advances | Classes will not polarize; middle strata is expanding                   |
| **Petty Bourgeoisie Fate** | Will sink into proletariat                   | Will join ranks of white collar workers                                 |
| **Revolution**             | Proletariat revolution is inevitable         | Proletariat revolution is not inevitable                                |
| **Worker Dissatisfaction** | Leads to bloody revolution                   | Can be expressed through strikes, demonstrations, go-slow, work-to-rule |

- **Weber's Concept**: Classes operate in the house of money and affect one's **life chances**
- **Life Chances**: One's ability to purchase those things from the market which are considered desirable

### Market Situation and Life Chances Examples

Different classes can afford different kinds of:

- **Education**: Private international schools vs local private schools vs government schools
- **Holidays**: International destinations vs domestic hill stations vs local outings  
- **Housing**: Bungalows in posh areas vs high-rises vs modest homes vs slums
- **Lifestyle**: Based on earning capacity and market situation

### Weber's Trinitarian Model: Class, Status, Party (1:01:10)

#### Class

- **Definition**: Social group whose members share a similar market situation
- **Operation**: Classes operate in the house of money
- **Impact**: Affects one's life chances

#### Status Groups

- **Definition**: Social group whose members share a similar status situation
- **Status Situation**: Amount of social honor, status, or prestige associated with that position
- **Operation**: Status groups operate in the house of prestige or social honor
- **Classic Example**: Caste system - castes are status groups
- **Lifestyle**: Members share similar lifestyle (food habits, dressing styles, language, accent)
- **Endogamy**: Status groups attempt closure and tend to marry within the group to preserve distinctive lifestyle

#### Party

- **Definition**: Social groups whose members have come together for acquisition of social power
- **Operation**: Parties operate in the house of power
- **Types**:
  - **Class-based parties**: Trade unions, CII (Confederation of Indian Industries), FICCI
  - **Status-based parties**: All India Jat Mahasabha, Bahujan Samaj Party
  - **Mixed parties**: All India Agarwal Small Traders Association (both status and class)
  - **Cross-cutting parties**: Indian National Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party

### Relationship Between Class and Status

- **General Pattern**: The two are frequently found together but not always

- **Examples of Divergence**:
  
  - **Newly Rich**: High class but may have lower status than old rich
  - **Poor Sadhu**: Low class but high status in society
  - **Rich Prostitute**: High class but low status
  - **Teacher vs Vendor**: Teacher may earn less than successful vendors but enjoys higher status

- **Long-term Trend**: Status follows money in the long run

### Marx vs Weber: Political Analysis

| Aspect              | Marx                                                      | Weber                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Political Focus** | Politics is shaped by economy; only class-based politics  | Apart from class, political action may be status-based      |
| **Party Formation** | Based on class interests only                             | Can be based on class, status, or both                      |
| **Example**         | Workers vs Capitalists have different political interests | BSP unites dalits across class lines based on shared status |

## Race and Ethnicity as Basis of Stratification (1:48:22)

### Concept of Race

- **Definition**: Race refers to a classification of human population into distinct categories based on phenotypical or biological differences
- **Physical Attributes**: Skin color, nasal index, cranial capacity, hair pattern, eye shape
- **Origins**: Began as a scientific classificatory scheme for human beings, similar to species classification in plant and animal kingdoms

### Blumenbach's Racial Classification (1799)

**Five Major Races**:

1. **Caucasian Race**: White-colored people (Europeans, North Americans)
2. **Ethiopian or Negroid Race**: Black Africans  
3. **Mongoloid Race**: Yellow (found in northeastern parts of India, China)
4. **Malayan Race**: Brown (Malaysia, Indonesia region)
5. **Red Race**: Native Americans (Red Indians, American Indians)

### Scientific Racism

- **Transformation**: Concept of race was used to justify racism
- **Core Argument**: People with different physical attributes also have varying levels of intelligence and capabilities
- **C.H. Cooley's View**: Biological differences between races are natural and result in different levels of intelligence
- **Evidence Cited**: IQ tests consistently showed whites scoring higher than blacks
- **Conclusion Drawn**: Whites are more intelligent than blacks

### Historical Context: Race Issues in United States

#### Slavery Period (1776-1865)

- **Legal Status**: Slavery flourished and was legal in America
- **Property Rights**: Blacks were regarded as property of whites
- **Regional Differences**: 
  - Northern states abolished slavery by 1805
  - Southern states continued slavery for economic reasons (cotton industry, slave labor dependency)

#### Civil War and Abolition

- **Abraham Lincoln**: Won 1860 election on anti-slavery platform
- **Secession**: Several southern states declared secession from America
- **Civil War**: Bloody civil war between North and South; North won
- **13th Amendment (1865)**: Prohibited slavery but did not make African Americans equal citizens

#### Post-Abolition Period (1890-1920)

- **Lynchings**: American society witnessed lynchings of African Americans
- **Nature of Lynchings**: Blacks were murdered and hanged in public; gruesome photos sent by postcards to instill fear

#### Civil Rights Movement

##### Early Organization

- **W.E.B. Du Bois**: Created NAACP (National Association for Advancement of Colored People) in 1909
- **NAACP Functions**:
  - Brought together black religious leaders, businessmen, politicians, professionals
  - Launched campaigns against lynchings and riots
  - Challenged discrimination in courts

##### Key Events

- **Rosa Parks Bus Incident (1955)**: Black lady refused to vacate seat meant for whites; sparked Civil Rights Movement

- **Assassination (1968)**: Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated
- **Civil Rights Act (1968)**: Made African Americans full and equal citizens of America

### Contemporary Racism in America

#### Du Bois on Institutionalized Racism

- **Institutional Level**: Racism was not only at individual level but institutionalized
- **Systematic Discrimination**: Blacks experienced legal hurdles preventing full participation in society

#### Post-1968: Post-Racist Society Claim

- **Argument**: With 1968 Civil Rights Act, America became post-racist society
- **Evidence**: America has had a black president while India never had a Dalit Prime Minister

#### Joe Feagin's Analysis: Total Racist Society

- **Counter-argument**: Contemporary America is a total racist society
- **Evidence**: Black Lives Matter movement highlighted ongoing issues

##### Black Lives Matter Movement Triggers

- **Trayvon Martin (2012-13)**: 17-year-old shot by another American who claimed self-defense; acquitted by all-white jury
- **George Floyd (2020)**: Police officer had knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes; last words "I can't breathe"

##### Contemporary Discrimination Patterns

- **Employment**: Studies show higher response rates for white-sounding names vs black-sounding names in job applications
- **Housing**: White neighborhoods hesitant to have black families
- **Criminal Justice**: Blacks overrepresented in prison population; racial profiling by police
- **Education**: Black children discriminated against in schools
- **Workplace**: Casual racist jokes common at workplace and educational institutions

#### Types of Racism: Ali Rattansi's Analysis

| Type           | Characteristics          | Arguments                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Old Racism** | Blatant and in-your-face | Scientific racism arguments that blacks are born inferior, less intelligent           |
| **New Racism** | Subtle and cultural      | Argument that subculture of African Americans is inferior; lifestyle leads to poverty |

#### Patricia Hill Collins: Controlling Images

- **Concept**: Dominant sections use "controlling images" to ensure racism, sexism, and social injustice are perceived as natural and inevitable
- **Media Portrayal**: African Americans often portrayed in violent roles (drug dealers, criminals, drug lords) in Hollywood movies
- **Impact**: Creates defining image of blacks as violent, aggressive, prone to crime

#### David and Gaither's Analysis

- **Victim Blaming**: Even when victim of crime is black, black persons are portrayed as aggressive and violent
- **Strategy**: Dig into past to highlight any instances of aggression, domestic abuse, jail time to show victim was "asking for it"

### Social Media and Resistance

#### Warren's Analysis

- **Trend**: People increasingly turning to social media for news and information
- **Content Characteristics**: Uncensored, unfiltered, uncontrolled by big and powerful traditional media
- **Traditional Media Control**: Typically owned and controlled by dominant sections of society
- **Democratic Platform**: Social media becomes platform for expression of marginalized sections
- **Examples**: Black Lives Matter movement, #MeToo movement primarily through social media
- **Advantages**: Anonymity, accessibility, can create account without money to vent against issues
