# Demographic Issues: MMR and IMR Analysis

## DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND AND AGING POPULATION (12:43)

- **Demographic Dividend**: When the share of working age population (15 to 59 years) is far more than the dependent age groups
- **Dependent Age Groups**: 
  - 0 to 14 years
  - 60 and above years

### Benefits of Having Young Population

- Can lead to increase in supply of labor
- It will increase the labor supply and then it can further lead to increase in consumption
- Overall it will fuel economic growth

### India's Age Structure

- **Working Age Population**: Around 64% (young generation)
- **Aged Population**: 12% (the old ones) 
- **Children**: Remaining percentage
- **Median Age in India**: 28 years (rounded to 28)

### International Comparisons

- India's median age is better than many countries including Japan, China, North America, Europe
- Africa is much younger than us (around 18)
- Pakistan and Bangladesh are also younger than India
- Sri Lanka is slightly older

### India's Demographic Window

- **Duration**: 2018 to 2055 (37-38 years)

## ELDERLY POPULATION CONCERNS (18:14)

### Problems of the Elderly

- They are the most neglected among the population
- The reason for that is India is considered to be a country filled with younger population
- Most of the policy measures are directed towards them (young population)

### Specific Problems Listed

- Neglected and often abused
- Neglected by the policy makers
- Various social problems confronting the elderly
- Loneliness
- Health issues and diseases
- Economic issues
- Psychological distress

### Policy Initiatives for Elderly

- We should make an age integrated society
- Civil society organizations working with the elderly to be encouraged

## FERTILITY AND POPULATION POLICY (19:40)

### Total Fertility Rate (TFR) Definition

- **TFR**: The number of children born by the female of reproductive age group (15 to 49 years)
- Specifically live babies
- Assuming she lives through the reproductive age and experiences age-specific fertility

### Population Control Bill Analysis

- **ALKA BASU's Analysis**: The differentiation between poor and rich class creates more difference than religious differences
- She argues that Muslims have higher fertility rates not because of Islam, but due to their socio-economic backwardness

### S.Y. QURESHI's Perspective

- Islam does not promote large families
- There is a perception that Muslims practice polygamy, but in India, Hindus are more polygamous than Muslims

## KERALA MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT (30:04)

### What is the Kerala Model

- Kerala has achieved very high not just literacy but overall human development
- Kerala is almost comparable to first world countries
- If Kerala can do it, then why can't the rest of India?
- Kerala model should be replicated in other parts of the country

### How Kerala Achieved This

- Kerala has invested heavily in social infrastructure, health and education specifically

### Limitations of Kerala Model (VISARIA's Critique)

- It's a flawed argument
- The Kerala model cannot be replicated nationally
- There are limitations

#### Reasons Why Kerala Model Cannot Be Replicated

1. **Geographical Advantage**: Kerala is a coastal state which UP and Haryana are not
2. **Historical Linkages**: Thanks to its long coastline, it has had historical linkages with other parts of the world
3. **Remittances**: People from Kerala have been regularly going to different other parts and sending money. Kerala receives huge remittances from the Gulf region which UP and Bihar do not
4. **Matrilineal Tradition**: In some communities, there is a tradition of matriliny, because of which the position of women is relatively better than in Haryana and Punjab
5. **Communist Influence**: Kerala has a long history of communist rule with strong communist influence, because of which land reforms were relatively better implemented in Kerala than in feudal Bihar or UP

### Policy Conclusion

- Kerala's peculiarities allowed it to achieve what it has
- The same conditions do not exist in other parts of the country
- Therefore, the Kerala model cannot be replicated
- Policies will have to factor in the local conditions of every region

## DEVELOPMENT AS THE BEST CONTRACEPTIVE (34:21)

### The Concept

- "Development is the best contraceptive"
- This means that simply as a society develops in the sense as it prospers economically, fertility and various other demographic parameters will be automatically taken care of
- Policy makers should focus on economic development
- As society becomes richer, people will automatically start having fewer children

### Evidence Supporting This Theory

- You have a lot of evidence which suggests that the more developed societies have lower fertility
- Even within a country like ours, richer people bear fewer children

### Limitations of This Approach

- This is part truth because what we need to appreciate as policy makers and social scientists is that the relationship between demographic characteristics and economic growth and development is two-way, not one-way
- If you have a population which is unhealthy, malnourished, then will they be able to be economically productive?
- Your economic productivity will be hampered because the population is not well-fed and healthy

### Policy Implication

- We need to address both
- You can't as policy makers and social analysts just focus on economic growth and development assuming that demographic parameters and concerns will be automatically addressed
- We have to work on both demographic health and profile as well as economic growth and development together

## LIMITATIONS OF POPULATION POLICY (38:11)

### Core Limitations

- Simply friends, the role of population policy is limited
- Governments can't do everything
- There are far too many variables that affect people's fertility behavior than government policy

### Personal Decision Making Factors

- How many children to have, when to have them, what gender to have
- These decisions are influenced by family, especially mother's wishes
- Concerns about who will light the funeral pyre
- Point is that population policy can only do so much
- People's fertility behavior is affected by several variables that are determined by various other factors

## INCREASING AGE OF MARRIAGE FOR WOMEN (40:02)

### Current Legal Framework

- **Present Age for Men**: 21 years
- **Present Age for Women**: 18 years
- **Proposed Change**: The Modi government is in a mood to increase the marriage age for women to 21 years

### Policy Background

- Based on the recommendations of the JAYA JAITLEY Committee
- Jaya Jaitley was a senior politician from the Samajwadi Party, close to GEORGE FERNANDES

### Arguments in Favor of Increasing Marriage Age

1. **Women's Empowerment**: Increasing the age of marriage of women is seen as a step towards women's empowerment

2. **Equality**: It will rectify the present difference in the age of marriage of men and women, making it 21 for both

3. **Community Standardization**: It will equalize the age of marriage for women across communities (addressing early marriages in some communities, namely Muslims)

4. **Educational and Employment Opportunities**: Due to early marriage, women are at a disadvantage when it comes to access to education opportunities and job opportunities

5. **Female Labor Force Participation**: It is expected that as the age of marriage for women is raised, it will boost and help to increase female labor force participation rate

6. **Women's Health**: It will improve women's health standards and nutritional levels because when a woman becomes pregnant at a young age, it has adverse health consequences

7. **Women's Autonomy**: All in all, it will help promote and make women more autonomous as they get better educational and job opportunities

### Opposition to the Move

#### Feminist Organizations Opposing

- All India Democratic Women Association
- All India Progressive Women Association  
- National Federation of Women
- Scholars like FLAVIA AGNES

#### Arguments Against the Move

1. **Sexual Autonomy Concerns**: If such a law is passed, it will adversely affect sexual autonomy of women
   
   - Such laws will be used to target couples who do love marriages
   - Parents will use this law to control their daughters
   - Women's personal liberty will be crushed

2. **Patriarchal Control**: This will increase the patriarchal control over marriages and women

3. **Class Bias**: This bill has serious class bias - it's anti-poor
   
   - Simply why? Who gets married at a younger age? Poor people
   - So their marriages will be seen as illegal

4. **Patriarchal State**: This move reflects the patriarchal nature of the Indian state
   
   - This is trying to dictate people's marital choices
   - It's a patronizing attitude - like the government knows better than people when to marry

### Current Reality (NFHS-5 Data)

- **23% of all marriages** are before the age of 18 years
- Almost 1/4 of all marriages are before the legal age of marriage
- This is after so many years of increasing the age of marriage to 18

### Scholar's Perspective on Implementation

- Scholars and activists are not saying it is not desirable that the age of marriage should rise
- What they are saying is **legislation is not the way to do it**
- Legislation is not the best way to increase the age of marriage

### Alternative Approaches Needed

- Address various factors because of which people indulge in early marriage
- Emphasize on the imperative of women's education
- Until society develops the sentiment that educating girls is necessary, early marriages will continue

## MUSLIM DEMOGRAPHIC DEBATE (55:32)

### Statistical Overview

#### Global Muslim Population Growth

- **600 AD**: 0% Muslims in the world
- **700 AD**: 3% Muslim population  
- **800 AD**: 7%
- **900 AD**: 11%
- **1900 AD**: 13-14%
- **2000**: About 20% of world's population was Muslim
- **2010**: 22.5%
- **2015**: About 24%
- **2020**: About 25%
- **Projected 2050**: 28-30%
- **Projected 2100**: 32-33%

#### India's Muslim Population Trends

- **1950**: About 10% of population was Muslim
- **1991**: 12.2%
- **2001**: 13+%
- **2011**: 14+%
- **Projected 2050**: About 18% (as per Pew Research estimates)

#### South Asia Context

- **1941** (around partition time): About 1/4 of total population (24%) was Muslim, and they were able to ensure the division of the country into three pieces
- **2011**: 31% of South Asia population is Muslim
- **Projected 2030**: 34%
- **Projected 2070**: 40%
- **Projected 2125**: Around 50%

### Arguments About Muslim Population Growth

#### Factors Contributing to Growth

1. **Higher Fertility Rate**: Historically, increase in the number of Muslims has been due to both conversions and higher fertility rate
2. **Conversions**: Both are considered a cause of concern by other religious communities

#### Counter-Arguments (Academic Perspective)

1. **ALKA BASU's Analysis**: 
   
   - The differentiation is more between poor and rich class than religious
   - Don't blame Muslims, blame the poor
   - Muslim higher fertility is due to their socio-economic backwardness, not because of Islam

2. **S.Y. QURESHI's Position**:
   
   - Islam does not promote large families
   - There is a perception that Muslims practice polygamy, but in India, Hindus are more polygamous than Muslims

3. **Future Projections**: According to Pew Research, what we are expecting from 2000 to 2050, increase in Muslim population will be almost entirely due to higher fertility, basically Africa globally has a young Muslim population with high fertility rate

### Regional Variations and Concerns

- If you have to look at Islamic expansion in India, instead of looking at it nationally, you should see it in pockets
- It's happening in certain districts
- Religious minorities are then decimated in Muslim dominant regions like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh
- In all three countries, the proportion of non-Muslims has become almost very low levels
- This necessitated the CAA Bill

### Student Perspectives from Transcript

#### Supporting Demographic Threat Theory

- Personal observations of larger families in Muslim communities
- Questions about population increase from 9% to 15%
- Concerns about future political implications
- References to Afghanistan, Bangladesh becoming Islamic states
- Concerns about demographic changes in specific regions

#### Migration Factor

- Suggestion that the biggest reason for Muslim population increase in India is migration from Myanmar and Bangladesh
- Need to control such migration

## MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE (MMR) (70:27)

### Definition

- **MMR**: The number of women who die during childbirth and within 42 days of childbirth due to birth-related complications, per lakh live births

### India's Current Status

- **As per SRS 2022**: India's MMR is 103 per lakh live births

### MMR as Development Indicator

- MMR and IMR are considered as strong indicators of the level of development of a society
- Richer countries and developed countries tend to have low MMR and low IMR
- Developing or underdeveloped countries have high MMR and IMR
- It's not necessarily only a function of economic strength (example: Sri Lanka has low MMR despite not being very rich)

### Regional Variations in India

- **Kerala**: MMR of 30
- **Assam**: MMR of 195
- Significant variations from a low of 30 in Kerala to a high of 195 in Assam

### Factors Resulting in High MMR

1. **Non-institutional Deliveries**: About 12% of all deliveries are non-institutional (at home instead of hospitals/medical facilities)

2. **Lack of Maternal Health Care**: Adequate medical attention needs to be given to pregnant women, which is often not available

3. **Anemia and Nutritional Deficiency**: 
   
   - Very large number of women suffer from anemia
   - Anemic women are required to take iron supplements or folic acid during pregnancy
   - Only 44% receive folic acid supplements while pregnant (NFHS data)

4. **Poverty**: A lot of people have to bear out-of-pocket expenditure for deliveries, which can often push people into poverty

5. **Early Marriage and Early Pregnancy**: Also contributes to higher MMR

## INFANT MORTALITY RATE (IMR) (78:55)

### Definition

- **IMR**: The number of deaths of children before attaining the age of one year, per thousand live births

### India's Current Status

- **As per NFHS**: India's IMR stands at 35.2 per thousand live births

### International Comparisons

- **Developed Countries**: Have IMR of 4-5 per thousand live births
- **China**: About 6-7 per thousand live births
- **Sri Lanka and Nepal**: Have much healthier and much better IMR than India

### Major Causes of Infant Deaths

1. **Pneumonia and Diarrhea**: A large number of infant deaths are due to these easily preventable diseases

### Prevention Methods

- **For Diarrhea**: ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) - water mixed with salt and sugar solution
- These deaths are easily preventable with low-cost interventions
- But there is lack of awareness

### Contributing Factors to High IMR

1. **Non-institutional Deliveries**: Risk of infant death increases if delivery happens at home

2. **Prenatal and Postnatal Care**: Infant mortality is affected by care of the child before and after delivery
   
   - **NFHS Data**: 31% of children with diarrhea were not taken to any health facility

3. **Maternal Mortality Link**: IMR is directly linked to MMR - if the mother dies soon after birth, chances of child surviving also decrease significantly

4. **Lack of Breastfeeding Awareness**:
   
   - Children should be breastfed exclusively for six months
   - The first breast milk produced by a mother is very nutritious for the infant
   - **NFHS Data**: 58% children were not breastfed within one hour of birth
   - **NFHS Data**: 36% children were not exclusively breastfed for six months

## SEX RATIO AND CHILD SEX RATIO (87:17)

### Sex Ratio Definition and Trends

- **Sex Ratio**: Number of females per thousand males
- **2001**: 933 females for 1000 males
- **2011**: 940 females for 1000 males  
- **NFHS-5**: 1020 females per 1000 males (which is awesome - more women than men)

### Historical Context

- Historically, India has been beset with the problem of an adverse sex ratio
- Due to patriarchal structure, customs like dowry, son preference, property passed down the male line

### Recent Improvements

#### Government Interventions

- Government interventions and programs like **Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao**
- Measures targeting specifically the vulnerable sections
- Identifying those districts and regions where sex ratio is particularly adverse
- Measures like celebrating successful sports persons
- PM had launched "Selfie with Daughter" campaign

### Child Sex Ratio Concerns

- **Child Sex Ratio**: Number of females per thousand males in the age group 0 to 6 years
- **2001**: 927
- **2011**: 919

#### Worsening Trend

- While India's sex ratio has been improving since a few decades now, **child sex ratio shows a worsening trend**
- From 1971 to 2011, with every successive census, the child sex ratio has dipped further
- This continues to remain a concern and indicates perverse practices like **female feticide and female infanticide**

### Causes of Female Feticide/Infanticide

#### Poverty Explanation vs. Reality

- **Frequently Cited Explanation**: Poverty compels people to kill the girl child
  - The poor can't afford to raise girls
  - Raising girls is expensive due to dowry
  - Boys are seen as investment who will bring something home when they grow up
  - Girl child is only an expense

#### ASHISH BOSE's Analysis

- **Reality**: It's not the poor who are engaging in female feticide and infanticide
- **Fact**: It is the more prosperous regions of the country where child sex ratio is very adverse

### DEMARU States (Rich States with Poor Child Sex Ratio)

- **DEMARU**: Daughter Eliminating Male Aspiring Ray (regions) for Ultrasound
- **States**: Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Chandigarh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh
- These are the Green Revolution pockets, very rich states with among the highest per capita incomes

### Requirements for Female Feticide

Three conditions are required for effective female feticide:

1. **Medical Infrastructure**: You need doctors with ultrasound machines
2. **Financial Capability**: Ability of clients to pay for sex-selective abortion (expensive because it's illegal)
3. **Connectivity**: Road connectivity to link to doctors

### BIMARU vs DEMARU

- **BIMARU states are not DEMARU** because they don't have money, roads, or adequate medical infrastructure
- It is the developed regions like Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh where you have qualified doctors with machinery, people with money and willingness to pay, and good road infrastructure

### AMARTYA SEN's Concept

- **High-tech Sexism**: Using latest technology and money to do sexist things
- Becoming technologically advanced and rich to do sexist activities

#### Missing Women Concept

- SEN introduced the concept of "missing women"
- As per Economic Survey and UNFPA, significant number of missing women in India

### Small Family Norm Impact

- **Counterintuitive Effect**: Small family norm being promoted by government is worsening the problem of female feticide
- **Logic**: When families were larger (10 children), having 3-4 girls was acceptable
- **Now**: If only having 1-2 children, they better be boys
- **BOSE's Quote**: Previously in Punjab, "the first girl child was welcomed, the second was tolerated, and the third girl child was eliminated. But now, even the first girl child is being killed"

### Policy Responses and Limitations

#### Government Schemes

- Schemes giving monetary incentives to people who have girl children
- Money provided when she grows up at 18

#### BOSE's Critique of Monetary Incentives

- These are not well thought out schemes
- It's not the poor who are eliminating the girl child
- It's not money which is the problem, so money is not the solution
- **Monetary incentives to prevent female feticide will not work**

#### What is Required (According to BOSE)

- **Registration and regular monitoring of all births**

### Legal Framework

- **PCPNDT Act 1994** (Pre-conception Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act)
- Prohibits using ultrasound technology for sex determination of the fetus
- **Problem**: Issue is in implementation
- **Nexus**: Between medical practitioners, police, and parents (the criminals)
- **Challenge**: It's a family decision to eliminate girl child, so who would complain?

#### Required Measures

1. **Effective Crackdown**: On ultrasound machines and clinics where such tests are being done
2. **Proper Implementation**: Of existing laws
3. **Penal Provisions**: Not just against medical practitioners but even against parents

### Regional Variations in Sex Ratio

#### Northern States

- **Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh**: Historically low sex ratio due to patriarchal norms, son preference, dowry system

#### Southern States

- **Tamil Nadu and Kerala**: Better sex ratio and child sex ratio due to:
  - Better educational levels
  - Better health infrastructure  
  - Matrilineal tradition in segments of population
  - Overall relatively better position of women in society

#### Eastern States

- **West Bengal and Odisha**: Relatively better sex ratio due to cultural factors
- Son preference is not as strong as in North India

#### Western India

- **Rajasthan and Gujarat**: Worse sex ratio
- **Maharashtra**: Relatively better

### Multiple Factors Affecting Regional Distribution

- Government policies and programs/interventions
- Health infrastructure
- Economic well-being
- Literacy rates
- Social and cultural norms

## SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (121:03)

### Definition (According to UN Population Fund - UNFPA)

Good sexual and reproductive health means:

1. **Safe Sexual Life**: That people are able to enjoy a healthy and safe sex life
2. **Reproductive Capability**: Capability to reproduce
3. **Freedom of Choice**: The freedom to decide when and how to do so

### Components of Sexual and Reproductive Health

- **Complete physical, mental and social well-being** in matters pertaining to sex and reproduction
- **Reproductive Rights of Women**: Their control over the reproductive process
- **Access to Contraceptive Methods**: Various contraceptive methods should be available

### Requirements for Good Sexual and Reproductive Health

1. **Access to Information**: People have access to information
2. **Access to Healthy Contraceptive Methods**: They have access to healthy contraceptive methods  
3. **Protection from STDs**: They can save themselves against sexually transmitted diseases
4. **Safe Pregnancy**: Women are able to have a safe and healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby

### Why Focus on Women?

- The notion of sexual and reproductive health encompasses both men and women
- **Reason for emphasis on women**: They are disadvantaged and marginalized, hence greater emphasis on women's sexual and reproductive well-being
- **Clarification**: This doesn't mean men don't matter - their sexual and reproductive health is also a concern of professionals and government agencies

### Sexual and Reproductive Health Concerns in India

#### Major Issues Identified

1. **Sex Education**: Very limited sex education
2. **Contraceptive Methods**: Inadequate healthy contraceptive methods, over-emphasis on female sterilization
3. **Taboo Nature**: Sex is still a taboo, people don't want to discuss it
4. **Consequences of Taboo**: Leads to ignorance, rumors, misconceptions regarding sexual activity and behavior, lack of open discussions on sex
5. **Marital Rape**: Denies women rights over their own bodies
6. **Quacks and Fake Practitioners**: Due to low awareness and infrastructure, many quacks work in the field of sexual well-being
7. **Mental Health**: Affects individual mental health
8. **Prostitution**: Males visit prostitutes, leading to spread of STDs
9. **Family and Social Pressure**: 
   - Lot of family pressure and societal pressure to bear children
   - Not just on women, also on men, but women carry the pregnancy
10. **Virginity Taboo**: We celebrate virginity, want virgin wives and partners
11. **Lack of Anatomical Knowledge**: People aren't aware of opposite sex anatomy
12. **Misconceptions**: Men are not aware of women's bodily processes like menstruation, lactation

### NFHS Data on Sexual and Reproductive Health

According to NFHS data, several concerns regarding sexual and reproductive health in India:

- How contraceptive usage is low
- How contraceptive pattern usage pattern is unhealthy  
- Almost 1/4 of all women were married before the age of 18 years (contributing to poor sexual and reproductive health)

### UN Population Fund Highlighted Concerns in Developing Countries

- **Urinary tract infections or reproductive tract infections**
- **Unwanted pregnancies**
- **Non-institutional deliveries**  
- **Low contraceptive usage**
- **Low level of men's participation in family planning**
- **High MMR**, etc.

### Measures for Better Sexual and Reproductive Health in India

1. **Family Planning Program**: India's family planning program encourages greater adoption of family planning methods

2. **National Population Policy 2000**: Underlined voluntary and informed choice of citizens in matters of family planning

3. **National Rural Health Mission**: Tries to improve the public health care delivery system in rural India

4. **RCH Program**: Reproductive and Child Health Program seeks to address equity concerns (some have lesser access to quality health care)

5. **Schemes**: 
   
   - **Janani Suraksha Yojana**: To promote institutional deliveries
   - **ASHA Workers**: Have been trained to perform the role of midwives

6. **Need to Address Emerging Challenges**: Such as ovarian cancer, increasing incidence of infertility

## MALNUTRITION (139:24)

### Global Context

- **Global Hunger Index 2023**: India ranks **111 out of 125 countries**

### Three Indicators of Malnutrition

1. **Stunting**: Low height for that age (low height for a given age)
2. **Wasting**: Low weight for that height (low weight for the given height)  
3. **Underweight**: Low weight for the given age

### India's Malnutrition Statistics (NFHS Data)

- **35.5% children in India are stunted**
- **19.3% are wasted**
- **32.1% are underweight**

### Analysis by ASHWINI DESHPANDE

- **Overall Improvement**: There has been improvement in these malnutrition parameters compared to NFHS-4
- **Limited Progress**: The improvement is not very substantial - only marginal improvement
- **Worsening in Some States**:
  - **13 states** saw an increase in stunting
  - **12 states** saw increase in wasting  
  - **16 states** saw increase in underweight proportion

### Emerging Concern: Overweight

- **23% men, 24% women, and 3.6% children are overweight**
- This also needs to be addressed

### SDG Target

- **Zero Hunger by 2030**: If India has to achieve the SDG of zero hunger by 2030, there is an urgent need to address the nutritional needs of particular vulnerable sections

### Vulnerable Sections Requiring Attention

- **Pregnant women**
- **Children**  
- **Adolescents**
- **Lactating women**

### Why Children's Concerns Are Not Taken Seriously

- **DESHPANDE's Analysis**: One reason why children's concerns such as malnutrition are not being addressed is because they don't have voting rights, so they are politically not potent

### Government Measures

1. **National Nutrition Mission and Poshan Abhiyan**: Launched to reduce stunting, wasting, and underweight

2. **ICDS (Integrated Child Development Services)**: Aims to supplement child nutrition programs with:
   
   - Nutrition and health education
   - Regular health checkups
   - Immunization drives, etc.

### Problems in Addressing Malnutrition

1. **Inadequate Budget**: Due to poor budgetary allocation and inadequate budgetary allocation
   
   - **Economic Impact**: It is estimated that about **4% GDP loss** India has to bear due to low productivity attributed to malnutrition

2. **Poor Implementation**: Poor implementation of existing policies

### Targeted vs Universal PDS Debate

#### Targeted PDS Advantages

- More cost-effective
- Otherwise people who don't need subsidized food grains will also avail it (rich and middle class)

#### Universal PDS Advantages

- **Problem with Targeted PDS**: Means lesser food grain will be made available, which is then often diverted to the market, so intended beneficiaries don't get it
- **With Universal PDS**: If you make it available for all segments of society, the better off may not still like to avail it because of low quality, so they will purchase from market at market prices

### Additional Requirements

- **Active Civil Society Engagement**: Civil society organizations can serve as an effective link between the government and the needy sections of society
