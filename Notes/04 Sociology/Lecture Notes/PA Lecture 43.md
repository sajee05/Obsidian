# Politics and Society: Nation, Citizenship, and Civil Society

## RECAP: STATE AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS (24:46)

- **State definition**: Monopoly over the legitimate use of physical force according to WEBER
- **Four key essential ingredients of state**:
  1. **Sovereignty**
  2. **Government** 
  3. **Territory**
  4. **International relations**

## CONCEPT OF NATION (26:24)

### Basic Understanding of Nation

- **State and nation** are often used interchangeably along with terms like nation-state, country, government
- In political science and political sociology, they carry **specific distinctive meanings**
- **Nation** is fundamentally **a feeling** - first and foremost it is a feeling
- Nation refers to a group of people who have that **feeling of oneness or unity** amongst them
- This feeling is often based upon some **shared element of culture**, sense of **shared history**, **belonging together**

### What Unites Indians as a Nation

- Indians don't speak the same language, don't belong to the same religion, ethnicity, or race
- What unites Indians:
  - **Common citizenship**
  - **Shared or common constitution**
- Nation means a kind of **sense or feeling of oneness or belonging together**

### STALIN'S Definition of Nation

According to STALIN, the term nation refers to:

> **A historically constituted stable community of people formed on the basis of common language, territory, economic life and psychological makeup, manifested in a common culture**

## NATION-STATE CONCEPT (30:32)

- **Nation-state** means when **national boundaries and state boundaries coincide**
- When a group of people who feel that they are one or belong together, they constitute an independent sovereign country
- **Nation**: A sense of belonging together, feeling of oneness and unity
- **State**: A geopolitical legal entity
- When both coincide, they constitute a **nation-state**

### Historical Emergence of Nation-States

| Period               | Development                        | Key Event                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Mid 17th Century     | Treaty of Westphalia 1648          | Recognition of sovereign rights of different states |
| 18th-20th Centuries  | Formation of various nation-states | Birth of nation-states in Europe                    |
| Before Nation-States | Empires existed                    | Multinational states with diverse peoples           |

#### Treaty of Westphalia (1648)

- **Westphalia** is a place in Germany
- Under this treaty, **sovereign rights of different states were recognized**
- Established principle: If you are an independent country, other countries won't have a right to interfere in your internal affairs
- This notion of **sovereignty** as we understand it today emerged in aftermath of this treaty

#### From Empires to Nation-States

**Empires were multinational states**:

- One king would enjoy sovereignty over vast territory
- Encompassed different groups of people speaking different languages, eating different foods
- Multiple nations within one empire which constituted a sovereign unit or state

**Transformation Process**:

- Empires gave way to nation-states
- People speaking same language decided to constitute independent countries
- French-speaking people constituted France
- German-speaking people constituted Germany
- This process took place during **18th to 20th centuries in Europe**

## NATIONALISM (39:09)

### Definition of Nationalism

- **Nationalism is a political principle and a sentiment** which considers that **political and national boundaries should coincide**

### Growth of Nationalism in Europe

The period of 18th to 20th century witnessed:

- **Growth of nationalism** in Europe
- **Formation of nation-states**
- This coincided with:
  - Rise and spread of **bureaucracy**
  - **Industrialization**
  - **Mass-based education**
  - **Mass-based politics**
  - **Mass media**

### Principle of National Self-Determination

- Those who constitute a nation, who belong together, who feel together have the **right to control their own futures**
- Their **political destinies** should be based on the **principle of national self-determination**
- Example: If we are Germanic people, why should French or Portuguese decide for us?

## BENEDICT ANDERSON'S THEORY (42:56)

### Nations as Imagined Communities

- **BENEDICT ANDERSON** terms nations as **imagined communities**
- **Nation is an imagined community**

### Why "Imagined"?

**Traditional Communities**:

- Small group of people characterized by **regular close face-to-face interaction**
- Example: Village community

**Modern Nation-States**:

- With industrialization, small-sized communities have been replaced by **large-scale complex societies**
- Ruled by bureaucracy
- People don't really know each other (Do all Indians know each other? Definitely not)
- Yet there is **strong feeling of oneness or belonging together**
- Due to **sheer scale or size of population**, it's not possible for all people to be intimately connected
- Hence it's an **imagined community**

## TYPES OF NATIONS (49:54)

### DICK McCRONE's Classification

**DICK McCRONE** in his book **"The Sociology of Nationalism"** distinguishes between:

| Type               | Source of Unity                         | Example                                      | Characteristics                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ethnic Nations** | Shared culture or common culture        | European nation-states (18th-19th centuries) | Cultural homogeneity                             |
| **Civic Nations**  | Common citizenship, common constitution | India                                        | Cultural heterogeneity united by legal framework |

### Civic Nations Characteristics

- **National sentiment arises from membership of a particular state**
- People of **different ethnic groups, different ethnicities are united by common citizenship**
- Rather than a common ethnic background

### India as a Civic Nation

- India was a **civic nation**
- **Founding fathers** embarked upon journey of **nation building**
- India did not have **cultural homogeneity** like European nation-states
- Indian society characterized by **heterogeneity**: Languages, religions, ethnicities, races

## NATION BUILDING IN INDIA (52:49)

### How Founding Fathers Welded Diverse Groups

**Constitutional and Legal Framework**:

- Unlike US, Indian states don't have separate constitutions
- All Indians owe allegiance to **same single constitution**
- **Single citizenship** (not different citizenship of states)
- Constitutional framework guarantees **equal rights to all citizens** irrespective of caste, creed, language, religion

**Unifying Elements**:

- **Common currency** (same rupee works across the country)
- **Common tax regime** (One nation one tax)
- **National symbols**: National anthem, national flag, national song

**Personification and Icons**:

- **Personification of nation**: Bharat Mata (elevated to level of sacred)
- **National icons and heroes**: 
  - MAHATMA GANDHI (father of the nation)
  - SACHIN TENDULKAR (pride of India, not just Maharashtra)
  - RABINDRANATH TAGORE (belongs to whole of India)
  - KALAM (icon for all Indians, not just Muslims)

**Common History**:

- **Teaching of common history** across the country
- We study history of India, not separate histories of different states
- Read about **Indian freedom struggle**, not regional struggles
- Gives sense of having **lived together, stayed together, grown together**

**Common Enemy**:

- Nothing beats a **common enemy** in cultivating nationalism
- During wartime, countries witness surge in nationalism
- **India-Pakistan match** unites Indians across caste, race, class, region, language, religion

### Promoting Common Culture (Controversial)

- **Promoting common culture** is somewhat controversial and problematic
- India's approach: **Respecting cultural diversity**
- Constitutional provisions for **freedom of religion**, protection to **linguistic minorities**, **religious minorities**

**Examples of Common Culture Attempts**:

- **Promotion of Hindi language** (leads to opposition in non-Hindi speaking states, particularly TAMIL NADU)
- **Uniform Civil Code** being pushed (argues that if criminal matters governed by same principles, so should civil matters)

## FUTURE OF NATION-STATES (68:11)

### Arguments for Nation-States Being Outdated

**Globalization Impact**:

- **Globalization** has integrated people across national boundaries
- Emergence of **global village**
- World has become so integrated and interdependent that boundaries have become meaningless

**Technology**:

- **Modern technology** has made redundant national boundaries
- Equal ease of communication across countries
- Earlier: STD calls, ISD calls with specific pins and higher charges
- Now: WhatsApp, Zoom meetings transcend boundaries

**Global Financial Architecture**:

- Bodies like **World Bank**, **IMF**, **WTO** have impinged upon notion of **state sovereignty**
- India's 1991-92 economic opening was not sovereign decision but **arm-twisting**
- Forex reserves crisis compelled India under **IMF's structural adjustment program**

**Supra-National Bodies**:

- Growth of supra-national bodies like **European Union**, **ASEAN**
- European Union has its own **parliament**, **currency**
- Many functions conventionally associated with state taken up by these organizations

**International Migration**:

- Substantial **ethnic minorities** in erstwhile ethnic nation-states
- **Influx of immigrants in Europe**
- Earlier nationalism based on **cultural homogeneity** no longer exists
- **Shared ethnicity** as basis of national unity is under pressure

**Global Challenges**:

- World faces **global challenges** that cannot be dealt with at nation-state level
- **Pandemic**, **climate change**, **international terrorism**, **international drug and human trafficking**
- These problems **transcend national boundaries**
- Require cooperation **above the level of nation-state**

### Arguments Against Death of Nation-States

**Evidence of Continued Relevance**:

- **Too early to write off nation-states**
- World still **organized in nation-states**
- Nation-states **zealously guard their territorial integrity**
- **Ukraine war**: War for safeguarding territory and sovereignty

**Recent Trends**:

- **Brexit**: Britons asserted national identity, rejecting supra-national integration
- **Surge in nationalism globally**, including India
- **Right-wing parties** with nationalism as important planks
- **One nation one everything** as example of nationalism

**Pandemic Response**:

- During pandemic (global challenge), first response was **stop international flights**
- **Vaccine nationalism**: My countrymen should get first right over life-saving vaccines

**Soft Power Diplomacy**:

- **Diaspora remains committed** to country of origin
- Example: CHANDRAYAAN was pride of India

## CITIZENSHIP (81:42)

### Definition and Basic Understanding

- **Citizenship** is an **identity** - one of many identities people have
- **Citizenship** tells **membership of a state** (not nation)
- It's like a **super right** which makes us able to enjoy other rights
- **Citizens have some rights which non-citizens do not have**

### Rights Exclusive to Indian Citizens

- **Voting rights**
- **Articles 15, 16, 19, 29, and 30** are available only to Indian citizens
- **Fundamental rights**: Some available to all, some only to citizens

### Historical Origins

- Concept of **citizenship** can be traced back to **ancient Greece**
- In ancient Greece, there were several **city-states**
- Those regarded as **full members of a city-state** were termed as **citizens**
- **Full members** with **full rights of participation** in collective life or political life

### Modern Understanding

**Citizens vs Subjects**:

- **Citizens** exist in **modern democratic political systems**
- **Monarchies** had **subjects** - literally those subject to authority of monarch
- **Subjects did not have rights** the way citizens do

**Legal Definition**:

- **Citizenship means the legal status of full membership of a political community**
- **Citizenship entails a special legal relationship between the individual and the state**

### Rights and Duties

**Rights**:

- **Citizenship is associated with a set of rights** of the citizen
- These rights are **guaranteed and protected by the state**
- Interestingly, state guarantees these rights **against the state itself**

**Duties**:

- **Equally importantly**: **Duties of citizen towards the state**
- **Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin**
- **Most prominent duty**: To **pledge his allegiance** (loyalty/वफादारी) **to the state**

## T.H. MARSHALL'S Theory (91:26)

### Expanding Notion of Citizenship

**T.H. MARSHALL** in his book **"Citizenship and Social Class"** makes key points:

1. **Notion of citizenship has expanded with time**
2. **Set of rights** associated with citizenship **has expanded over time**

### Three Stages of Citizenship Evolution

| Century          | Type of Rights       | Examples                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **18th Century** | **Civil Rights**     | Freedom of speech, freedom of thought, right to personal liberty, equality before law               |
| **19th Century** | **Political Rights** | Right to vote, right to contest elections, hold public office                                       |
| **20th Century** | **Social Rights**    | Right to decent standard of living, right to education, clean drinking water, welfare state notions |

### Citizenship and Social Class Relationship

**Expanding Citizenship = More Equality**:

- People becoming **more and more equal**
- **Greater equality in society**
- Same freedom of speech and expression rights regardless of class

**Social Class = Inequality**:

- **Social class denotes inequality in society**
- **Hierarchy** in society

**Key Question**: As citizenship expands, will we eventually have **egalitarian society** or **classless society**?

**Answer**: **No** - Despite expanding citizenship, **inequality and social classes will not be wiped out**

**Reason**: **Basis of inequality is the right to property**

### Criticisms of Marshall's Theory

- **Primarily based upon English history** - not necessarily applicable everywhere
- **Male-centric understanding** - how rights were granted to men, feminist scholars criticize this approach

## CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT ACT (CAA) AND NATIONAL REGISTRY OF CITIZENS (NRC) (99:01)

### Background of NRC

- **Outcome of ASSAM agitations** and **Assam Accord with RAJIV GANDHI government**
- **Alleged**: Illegal migration from Bangladesh changing **demographic character** of Assam
- **Initially**: Based on **linguistic lines** (Assam belongs to Assamese speakers)
- **Later**: Became **communal/religion-based** as ethnic boundaries shifted
- **1980s Rajiv Gandhi Accord**: Decided to create **National Registry of Citizens** to identify Indian citizens

### CAA Details

- **Fast-tracked citizenship** for **non-Muslims** from **Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh**
- **Included**: Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, etc.
- **Criteria**: Those who came before 2014 or lived for five years in India
- **Excluded**: Muslims
- **Rationale**: Muslims being numerical majority in these Islamic countries wouldn't be victims of religious persecution

### Widespread Protests - Reasons for Opposition

**Discriminatory Nature**:

- **Muslims were being singled out**
- **Denied citizenship** which was offered to non-Muslims
- **Aligns with Hindutva ideology** of demonizing and excluding Muslims

**Documentation Issues**:

- **Many people wouldn't have documents** to prove citizenship
- Cases of **Indian army personnel** and their families being questioned
- **Authentic Indian citizens** might be affected

**Human Rights Concerns**:

- **Detention centers** for people without documents
- **Gross violation of human rights**
- What if **Bangladesh not willing to accept** back migrants?
- Many have **made India their home**
- India historically had **open arm policy** welcoming people of all faiths

### Government's Arguments in Favor

**Resource Strain**:

- **Illegal immigrants claiming resources** of society
- **Citizens have first rightful claim** over finite/limited resources
- **Won't be committed citizens** to idea of India

**Protection for Persecuted Minorities**:

- **Non-Muslims were persecuted minorities** in Muslim countries
- **Proof**: Dwindling populations of non-Muslims in these countries
- **Muslims don't need protection** being majority in those countries

### Scholarly Analysis

**BARRINGTON MOORE JR. and ZYGMUNT BAUMAN** suggest:

- In a **large country** with **growing population** and **limited resources**
- Government may attempt to **delegitimize a section of population** because of its **failure to contain population** and **inability to provide for all sections**

**Analysis**: Government deliberately trying to **delegitimize Muslims** in India, pinning societal problems on them as mechanism to **hide government's failure**

**SURAJ GOEL** writes: **CAA-NRC is the graveyard of citizenship**

- About **2 million people** kept out of NRC
- **Logistical nightmare** for government to manage/transport this population
- **Promoting xenophobia** (fear of foreigners/outsiders)
- **Out of sync with civilizational ethos** of India
- Can lead to **major socio-political catastrophe**

## CIVIL SOCIETY (135:16)

### Basic Understanding

- **Civil society** is umbrella term for **voluntary organizations**
- Academic term for **NGOs** or **voluntary organizations**
- Examples: Teaching poor children, **People for Animals (PFA)**, distributing sanitary pads, **Friends of Tribal Society**

### Theoretical Framework

**Society Division**:

- **Private Sphere**: Family
- **Public Sphere**: Contains three sectors
  1. **State/Government** (characterized by **coercive power**)
  2. **Private Sector** (characterized by **profit orientation**)
  3. **Civil Society** (third sector)

**Civil Society Definition**:

- **Non-government, non-corporate third sector** of public sphere
- **Neither enjoys coercive power nor driven by profit motive**
- **Aggregate of non-governmental organizations and associations** engaged in pursuit of **public welfare**

### Characteristics of Civil Society

1. **Absence of coercive power** (cannot compel like governments)
2. **Independent of government**
3. **Not driven by profit motive**
4. **Belongs to public sphere**
5. **Association is voluntary** (voluntary associations)
6. **Characterized by public spiritedness**

### Wide Array of Organizations

| **Social Religious Organizations** | RSS, KHALSA AID                                                         |
| **NGOs**                           | AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, GREENPEACE, CHILD RELIEF AND YOU, HELP AGE INDIA |

## THEORETICAL EVOLUTION OF CIVIL SOCIETY (154:37)

### Classical Understanding

**LOCKE and ROUSSEAU**:

- Contrasted **civil society with state of nature**
- **State of nature**: Pre-government stage of human existence
- This is **not** how we understand civil society today

### Modern Understanding

**J.S. MILL and TOCQUEVILLE**:

- **Civil society as domain of intermediate voluntary associations**
- These associations **check the excesses of the state**
- **Closer to current usage** of the term civil society

## ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN DEMOCRATIC POLITY (157:21)

### Why Civil Society is Essential for Democracy

**Makes Democracy More Regular**:

- Democracy becomes **more than once in five years affair**
- **Regular participation** beyond just elections

**Awareness and Education**:

- **Makes people aware of their rights**
- **Creates awareness on socio-political issues**

**Mobilization and Participation**:

- **Mobilizes people for protests and agitations**
- **Creates more participatory democracy**
- **Ensures wider participation** in democratic polity

**Voice for Marginalized**:

- **Highlights concerns of marginalized sections**
- **Gives voice and platform to the voiceless**
- Example: **Public Interest Litigations (PILs)** for children of under-trials, education of children of sex workers

**Government Accountability**:

- **Keeps watchful eye on government**
- **Holds government accountable**
- **Demands transparency** and corruption-free governance
- **Highlights acts of omission or commission**
- **Reminds those in power of their promises**

- **Not only criticizes but actively participates**
- **Assists government in developmental exercise**
- **Partnerships in education, healthcare services**
- **Running camps**: Blood donation, free checkups, eye surgeries
- **Welfare schemes** for vulnerable sections

### Why Government Relies on Civil Society

**Limitations of Bureaucracy**:

- **Large size** makes them **disconnected from people on ground**
- **Civil society organizations** being smaller **operate closer to people**
- **Better understand needs of people**

**Represents Grassroots Democracy**:

- **Grassroots democracy** and **decentralized governance**
- **Less bureaucratic leakage** (RAJIV GANDHI said of every rupee spent for welfare, only 15-17 paise reaches the poor)
