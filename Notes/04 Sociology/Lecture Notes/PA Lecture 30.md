# Patriarchy, Feminism, and Religion in Sociology

## Patriarchy and Sexual Division of Labor (13:19)

- **Patriarchy**: A system of dominance of men over women expressed through different social institutions and social structures
- **Key Scholar**: SYLVIA WALBY defines patriarchy as social structures and practices wherein men dominate, exploit and oppress women
- **Sexual Division of Labor**: Assignment of different tasks and roles based on gender distinctions

### Patriarchy in Different Spheres of Social Life

#### Patriarchy in Religion (14:47)

- Church positions are occupied mostly by men across religions
- Scriptures are mostly authored and interpreted by men
- Prophets are men, Gods are men
- Social rules governing marriage, divorce, adoption, property transfer favor men
- Menstruation taboo exists
- **Key Scholars**: KAREN ARMSTRONG and SIMON WALI have written about patriarchy and religion

#### Patriarchy in the Family (16:12)

- **ANNE OAKLEY's Criticism of Mother-Housewife Role**:
  
  - By the number of people it affects (half the population), it should be considered public health crisis number one
  - It alienates women, confines them to monotonous household work
  - Society doesn't give women any respect, no pay, no leave, no promotion

- **JESSE BERNARD on Marriage**:
  
  - "In every marriage there are two marriages"
  - Women are the net losers while men are the net beneficiaries in marital union

#### Patriarchy at the Workplace (18:35)

- Women don't get promotions easily
- Sexual harassment at the workplace
- **Glass Ceiling and Glass Cliff**: When failure is imminent, top positions are given to women, and then the blame for that failure is put on women

#### Patriarchy in Education (24:13)

- Male child is given greater preference for higher education
- Lower paid teaching jobs have greater female participation; better-paid higher levels have more male teachers
- Fewer women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics)
- Higher dropout rate for females
- **Gender Gap in Literacy**: Male literacy rate is about 17 percentage points higher than female literacy rate (2011 census)
- Lack of girls' toilets in educational institutions
- Sexual harassment in educational institutions

## Women and Development (21:51)

- Development is both affected by and affects the position of women in society
- Less developed societies typically exhibit poorer position of women
- As societies become more developed, position of women improves but not necessarily automatically
- **Japan Example**: Developed society but position of women is not very advanced

### Global Statistics

- **International Labor Organization**: Global gender gap in labor force participation rate of 23% globally, 50% in South Asia
- **World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report 2023**: Gender gap exists on all four parameters - least in health, followed by education, maximum in political empowerment

## Patriarchal Bargain (29:57)

- **Concept by**: DENISE KANDIYOTI in her article "Bargaining with Patriarchy"
- **Definition**: A woman upholds and accommodates patriarchal norms and accepts traditional gender roles in a patriarchal society in order to maximize her own power and options

### How Patriarchal Bargain Works

- Women choose to uphold and impose patriarchal norms on fellow women
- **Examples**:
  - Mother-in-law puts pressure on daughter-in-law to bear a male child
  - Mother polices daughter's clothing choices before marriage
  - Neighborhood aunties criticize girls who come home late
  - Female colleagues suggest successful women "slept their way to the top"

### Why Women Participate

- **Individual Benefits**: Upholding patriarchal norms can bring significant rewards - psychological, emotional, social
- When daughter-in-law bears male child, mother-in-law's position in society rises
- When mother polices daughter's choices, society says she is a good mother
- **Result**: Individually women may gain, but women as a category suffer as patriarchy is legitimized, reinforced and perpetuated

### Victim Blaming Example

- In cases of rape or sexual misconduct, women often blame the victim
- Questions like "What was she doing at that hour?" or "Why was she dressed provocatively?" come from other women
- Men have "outsourced patriarchy to women"

## Sylvia Walby's Six Structures of Patriarchy (42:32)

**SYLVIA WALBY** in her book "Theorizing Patriarchy" discusses six structures that help maintain male domination:

### 1. Household Production (43:39)

- Men benefit from women's unpaid labor
- All household chores assigned to women: cooking, raising children, cleaning, washing utensils, looking after elderly
- No pay, no dignity for women's household work

### 2. Paid Work (44:23)

- Men dominate in paid work sector
- Women enter a specifically women's jobs market, competing with other women, not men
- **Pink Collar Jobs**: Women's jobs are typically less paid, less prestigious
- **ANNE OAKLEY's Observation**: Women's jobs in labor market are often extension of their domestic roles
  - Home: Women look after sick and elderly → Employment: Nurses
  - Home: Women look after children → Employment: Primary school teachers
  - Home: Women welcome guests → Employment: Receptionists

### 3. The State (48:12)

- State is a patriarchal institution
- Most positions in government (bureaucracy, political system, judiciary) occupied by men
- Pro-women legislation remains mostly unimplemented or poorly implemented

### 4. Culture (49:44)

- Culture of western societies is largely patriarchal
- Key sign of femininity is sexual attractiveness to men
- Pornography is all-pervasive and commodifies/dehumanizes women

### 5. Sexuality (51:44)

- Sexual double standards exist in society
- Sexually expressive women considered "easy"
- Sexually aggressive men considered "studs"
- Women's sexuality condemned while male sexuality celebrated

### 6. Violence (58:41)

- Women continue to face physical violence and abuse
- **UN Women Statistic**: Every third woman in the world has experienced spousal violence

## The Personal is Political (54:03)

- **Concept by**: CAROL HANISCH
- **Meaning**: What happens between man and wife in private sphere has wider societal ramifications
- Challenges the divide between personal and public domains
- What a man does to his wife in sexual act is expression of patriarchal power
- Society and state must intervene; it's not merely a personal matter

## Sexist Humor and Patriarchy (59:48)

- **MICHELLE BEER MILLER** argues sexist humor and jokes normalize misogyny
- Such humor frequently sexualizes and objectifies women
- Devalues women's abilities and contributions
- Stereotypes women and even encourages violence against women
- **Examples**: Blonde jokes, nagging wife jokes, spending habits jokes
- These jokes tend to dehumanize women and normalize patriarchy

## Types of Feminism (69:23)

**Feminism**: An ideology and movement which seeks to dismantle patriarchy and replace it with equality (not matriarchy)

- **KAMLA BHASIN**: "The opposite of patriarchy is equality, not matriarchy"
- Feminist agenda is not to replace male dominance with women's dominance but create egalitarian society

### Liberal Feminism (72:16)

**Key Scholars**: BETTY FRIEDAN and GLORIA STEINEM

- Seeks to integrate women into existing structures of mainstream society
- Accepts broad existing societal framework but seeks gradual improvements
- **Methods**: Through legal and political reforms

**Measures Advocated**:

- Women's education
- Voting rights for women
- Greater political representation through reservation
- Economic empowerment through equal pay for equal work
- Equal opportunities for women in workplace
- Maternity leave and childcare facilities
- Measures to address sexual harassment at workplace
- Social security measures for vulnerable women (tribal women, Dalit women, sex workers, widows)

### Marxist Feminism (77:01)

**Key Scholars**: SHEILA ROWBOTHAM, ANGELA DAVIS, VERONICA BEECHEY, CLAUDIA JONES

- Women's subordination benefits the capitalist class
- In capitalist society, everything is commodified, including women's bodies
- Multi-billion dollar industries thrive on commodification of women: pornography, sex work, human trafficking, advertising

**Solution**: 

- Abolition of private property and establishment of truly communist society
- Only in communist society can men and women be truly equal

**Historical Evidence**:

- Position of women in Eastern Bloc during communist period was substantially better than in capitalist societies
- Sexual division of labor was less stark
- However, even socialist societies were far from gender equal

### Radical Feminism (84:23)

**Key Scholars**: SHULAMIT FIRESTONE, BROWN MILLER, CAROL HANISCH

- Argues for complete overhaul and replacement of existing social structures and relationships
- Liberal feminist measures will hardly have any long-lasting profound effect
- Women cannot be emancipated in prevailing social arrangements

**Critical Views**:

- Very critical of family as it exists
- Critical of notion of motherhood and mother-housewife role
- Motherhood traps women by putting whole onus of child-rearing on women
- No equivalent concept exists for men
- Motherhood is social construct imposed by patriarchal culture

**Radical Solutions**:

- Abolition of mother-housewife role
- Alternative child-rearing mechanisms:
  - Kibbutz-type system where community raises children
  - State could raise children on behalf of society
  - Professional parents concept (like other professions)
- Create gender-free society (not just gender-equal)
- In gender-free society, people not bound by gender categories

### Lesbian Feminism (93:00)

**Key Scholars**: RITA MAY BROWN and BARBARA SMITH

- Suggests political lesbianism as sexual choice and political statement
- **Core Argument**: Lesbianism is logical outcome of feminism
- Heterosexuality is patriarchal - can never have gender-equal relationship
- Men taught to be dominant and aggressive; women taught to be passive and submissive
- Man-woman relationship can never be between equals
- Women should invest energy in developing strong relationships with other women

## Shulamit Firestone's Theory (97:55)

**Book**: "The Dialectic of Sex"

### Key Arguments

- **Gender inequality predates and is the basis of class inequality**
- Because of differences in male and female biology, women became dependent on men when pregnant and nursing children
- This dependency created gender inequality
- Gender inequality produced a "power psychology" - men started enjoying women's dependence
- Some men sought to extend this power to dominate other men, leading to class inequality

### Solution

- Women must be freed from biological function of reproduction
- True gender equality possible only when human babies can be manufactured outside female body
- **Challenge**: Science and technology establishment dominated by men
- Must "seize the means of reproduction," not just means of production

## Religion - Origins and Theories (115:39)

### Definitions of Religion

**ROLAND ROBERTSON**: "A belief in the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life"

**YINGER**: "A system of beliefs and practices by means of which a group of people struggle with the ultimate problems of human life"

**Ultimate Problems Include**:

- What is the purpose of life?
- Why was I born?
- What happens after death?
- Is there life after death?
- Why does evil exist and prosper?
- Why do good people suffer premature death?

## Origin Theories of Religion (128:00)

### Theory of Naturism (128:10)

**Scholar**: MAX MUELLER

- **Core Idea**: Religion began as nature worship
- Primitive man was greatly exposed and vulnerable to forces of nature
- Natural forces produced awe, wonder, bewilderment and terror
- To overcome emotional turmoil, primitive man personified forces of nature and began worshiping them
- **Examples**: River became Ganga Maya, Sun became Surya Devata, Rain god became Indra Devata, Winds became Vayu Devata
- **Benefit**: Could have conversation with personified forces, propitiate them

### Theory of Animism (134:22)

**Scholar**: E.B. TYLOR

- **Core Idea**: Religion began as spirit worship
- Word "anima" means spirit or life force
- Primitive man's mind puzzled by two questions:
  1. What makes difference between living and dead?
  2. What are figures we see in dreams and visions?
- To answer these, primitive man invented concept of spirit/soul
- **Explanation**: Living have soul in body; dead have soul departed; dreams show souls temporarily visiting
- Once concept invented, spirits associated with various objects: mountains, trees, rivers, etc.

### Ghost Theory (143:51)

**Scholar**: HERBERT SPENCER

- **Core Idea**: Religion began as worshiping ghosts, particularly of dead ancestors
- Primitive man scared of ghosts and wanted to buy peace with them
- Ghosts of ancestors were particularly powerful and important
- Performed rituals to propitiate ancestral ghosts

## Functional Theories of Religion (146:07)

### Malinowski's Study (147:53)

**Study Subject**: Trobriand Islanders (primitive island community)

**Key Observations**:

- Primary livelihood was fishing (two types):
  1. Near shore fishing
  2. Deep sea fishing
- Religious practices associated only with deep sea fishing, not near shore
- Religious activity also witnessed during life crisis events (death, marriage, puberty, birth)

**Conclusion**:

- Religion helps mitigate uncertainty and overcome anxiety
- Deep sea fishing involves uncertainty and risk to human life
- During life crisis events, members express solidarity with individual undergoing transformation
- Provides comfort to the bereaved when member physically removed from society

### Talcott Parsons' View (154:24)

**Functions of Religion**:

1. **Agent of Socialization**: Shared norms and values transmitted from one generation to next through religion

2. **Provides Answers**: Religion provides answers to difficult questions and gives meaning to man's life
   
   - What happens after death?
   - How did it all begin?
   - What is purpose of life?
   - How should I conduct myself?

3. **Adjustment Mechanism**: Helps man adjust to unpredictable changes and tide over difficult times

### Criticism of Functional Theory (157:20)

1. **Marxist Perspective**: Religion is source of oppression and exploitation (of lower castes, women) which functional theory ignores

2. **Conflict Source**: Religion is major source of conflict, violence and bloodshed, not just harmony and cooperation
