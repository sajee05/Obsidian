# Sociology Lecture: Marriage, Kinship, and Feminist Movements in India

## CHALLENGES BEFORE THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT IN INDIA (22:07)

- This section was missed in the previous lecture on kinship and needs to be covered before continuing
- These challenges occur where contemporary feminist movements are discussed including topics like hijab, triple talaq, and surrogacy

### Major Challenge: Patriarchal Ideology

- **Patriarchal ideology**: Has a very strong stranglehold on people's minds and Indian society
- The hold of patriarchal ideology on people's ways of thinking is very strong
- Among the strongest defenders of patriarchal practices, customs, and thought patterns are women themselves
- Point is that you are up against a mighty enemy in this feminist battle which is the patriarchal ideology

### Examples of Patriarchal Influence

**SATI Temple Issue (1980s):**

- In 1980, for the sake of secularism, when the whole SATI issue had cropped up with ROOP KANWAR committing this thing in that decade
- Land was granted by the government for the building of a SATI temple in Delhi
- SATI temple was to be built on land and land was granted for that by the Delhi government

**Counter-Movements:**

- Feminist academicians, activists, urban educated women carried out a march against this thing saying this is a regressive thing
- Why should regressive practices like SATI be encouraged and glorified?
- There was a counter march organized by orthodox Hindu women saying "No, this is our culture, we have to worship SATI MATA"
- This is our part of our culture

**Domestic Examples:**

- You will find any number of examples from daily life where it is the mother-in-law who pressures the daughter-in-law to bear a son

### Challenge Identified by MAITREYI CHAUDHARY

**Two Major Challenges:**

1. **Globalization and Multinational Corporations**
   - MNCs pose a challenge to feminist movements and women empowerment
   - These MNCs have very deep pockets - they are multi-billion dollar conglomerates with deep pockets
   - Good chunk reserved for advertising expenditure
   - They are spending millions on advertising to capture people's mind space, brand recall

**Problem with MNC Advertising:**

- They do portray women as empowered
- But the kind of image of the empowered woman that they give is very different from what are the real aims and objectives of the feminist movement in India
- Their portrayal of empowerment is very superficial
- An empowered woman is one who buys a scooter and roams around
- An empowered woman is one who applies fair and lovely and confidently enters the interview room
- Empowered woman is she who can procure the goods from the market

**Real Concerns vs. Advertised Concerns:**

- The real concerns of Indian women are very different
- They are not fairness and scooter
- They are access to education, property rights, domestic violence
- These issues are being diverted from

**MNC Strategy:**

- Advertising by MNCs highlight women's issues in quotes

- Which are very different from the real concerns of Indian women

- They kind of hijack the lingo

- They rely upon lingo like freedom, liberty, liberal, all of that

- But then they are digressing from the real issues which concern Indian women
2. **Rise of HINDUTVA**
   - **HINDUTVA**: Problematic for everybody in general and the women's movements in India
   - HINDUTVA basically glorifies HINDUISM, Hindu identity, Hindu culture
   - According to many of the feminists, it is patriarchal and misogynistic
   - HINDUTVA movement envisages women in a very traditional kind of role

**Traditional Hindu Society Expectations:**

- In traditional Hindu society, what is the right place for a woman?
- Inside the homes, in the domestic sphere
- So there is this domesticated image of women

### Additional Challenges

**Caste Domination in Women's Movements:**

- Women's movements in India are by and large dominated and controlled by SAVARNA women (upper caste women)
- **GOPAL GURU**: Has written an article titled "DALIT WOMEN TALK DIFFERENTLY"
- DALIT women's social location is different
- They are placed in a different place in society
- Their everyday experiences are different, their concerns are different, their problems are different

**Inability to Address DALIT Concerns:**

- Women's organizations controlled and dominated by SAVARNA women are unable to articulate or express the concerns of DALIT women
- Women's organizations controlled and dominated by SAVARNA women are unable to articulate and even appreciate the concerns of DALIT women

**Caste-Based Violence:**

- Something which DALIT women have to face which SAVARNA women don't have to: caste-based violence
- When caste conflicts or caste atrocities happen, DALIT women are raped
- Rape of upper caste women also happens but without the caste dimension
- Here they are doubly burdened by caste and gender
- Also often times poverty or class inequality

## MARRIAGE AMONG HINDUS (34:21)

### Hindu Marriage as Sacrament

- **The Hindu marriage ceremony among Hindus is known as VIVAH**
- Hindu marriage is a **sacrament** - it is an important ritual
- In the life of a Hindu there are **16 SANSKARAS** (16 important rituals) that have to be performed at various life stages

- **VIVAH SANSKAR**: The marriage ceremony is an important ritual

### Sacred Character of Hindu Marriage

- **Hindu marriage among Hindus is sacred in character**
- It is sacred (not secret)
- As we will move forward, we will develop an understanding that in contrast, marriage among Muslims is in the nature of a contract

### Reasons for Sacred Character

**1. One of the 16 SANSKARAS:**

- It is one of the 16 SANSKARAS and an important ritual in the life of a Hindu
- The marriage ceremony constitutes an important ritual and sacrament in the life of a Hindu
- That makes it sacred in character

- In Hindu philosophy, an individual passes through four stages and ASHRAMS
- **Marriage and procreation are integral to the GRIHASTHA ASHRAM**
- Marriage and procreation are an integral part of the GRIHASTHA ASHRAM in the Hindu way of life

**Purpose of Marriage in Hindu System:**

- Why is marriage necessary? Why can't I just be a productive member of society?
- Why must I be a reproductive member of society also?
- For lineage - lot of rituals for the ancestors are performed by the progeny or future generations
- For the fulfillment of PITRU RIN (ancestral debt)
- For the fulfillment of DHARMA
- I have to perform various rituals in the GRIHASTHA ASHRAM
- Can I perform them by myself? No, I can only perform them with my wife by my side
- She is my DHARMPATNI (religious partner)

**3. Objectives of Hindu Marriage:**

- One of the objectives for marriage among Hindus is **DHARMA, PRAJA, and RATI**
- **DHARMA**: Performing various social, religious obligations
- This is why Hindu marriage is sacred

- **SAPTAPADI**: When the bride and the groom symbolically take seven steps together
- **Chanting of MANTRAS**: The Hindu marriage involves chanting of VEDIC MANTRAS by BRAHMIN priests, which are sacred texts from the VEDAS

### Indissoluble Nature

- **Because the Hindu marriage is sacred in character, the marital bond is indissoluble**
- **It cannot be dissolved** - it is irrevocable, indissoluble
- For how long does Hindu marriage last? For births and births (multiple lifetimes)
- Even death does not dissolve the marital bond, so strong and sacred it is in character

## KANYA DAAN CEREMONY (43:49)

### Definition and Meaning

- **KANYA DAAN**: What is KANYA DAAN?
- **KANYA**: Virgin girl (not just any girl)
- **DAAN**: To donate and to give
- **KANYA DAAN literally means to donate a virgin or gift a virgin**
- That would be the literal meaning of the word KANYA DAAN

### Significance in Hinduism

- **KANYA DAAN has immense significance in Hinduism**
- According to the MANUSMRITI, KANYA DAAN is the greatest of all DAAN that a person can make in his lifetime
- No donation is bigger, higher, or more noble than this
- In fact, it is considered that performing KANYA DAAN ceremony can result in attaining MOKSHA

### Religious Significance

**Groom as Avatar:**

- Through the marriage ceremony, the Hindu groom is regarded as an avatar of BHAGWAN VISHNU
- During the marriage ceremony, the Hindu groom is regarded as a veritable avatar of BHAGWAN VISHNU
- So the KANYA DAAN is made to Lord VISHNU who is present in the form of the groom

### Symbolic Representation

### Transfer of Guardianship

**After KANYA DAAN ceremony:**

- There is a clear transfer of ownership/guardianship
- **Transfer of guardianship of the girl from the father to the husband**
- The status of the bride changes immediately with KANYA DAAN
- The status of the bride changes immediately from daughter to wife
- The journey from daughter to wife is completed in one moment

### KULVADHU Status

**Post-Marriage Status:**

- After marriage, what do you become? Particularly those belonging to high status families - **KULVADHU**
- **KULVADHU**: What is the meaning of the word KULVADHU?
- **KUL**: The clan
- **VADHU**: Daughter-in-law
- So she is the daughter-in-law of the whole clan

**Historical Context:**

- In olden times, the daughter-in-law in high status and cultured families was referred to as KULVADHU
- The daughter-in-law in high status and cultured families was referred to as KULVADHU

**Weight and Respect:**

- Does the word contain some sort of weight? When you refer to a woman not just as BAHU but as KULVADHU?
- BAHU is common in every house, but when you say KULVADHU, how is she different from a BAHU?
- The word automatically suggests that position contains and is associated with respect and honor
- There is a lot of respect and honor associated with the position of a KULVADHU

### Expectations from KULVADHU

**Drastic Change in Status:**

- When you change from a daughter to a KULVADHU, it is expected to lead to a drastic change
- The transition from daughter to KULVADHU (daughter to the daughter-in-law of the clan) results in a drastic change in status and conduct
- Her whole life is greatly transformed

**Behavioral Expectations:**

- A KULVADHU is expected to behave very differently in a manner which is becoming of a KULVADHU
- She has to conduct herself according to her status

### Custodian of Honor

- **As a KULVADHU, a woman is the custodian of the honor of the whole clan**
- Which clan? Both husband's clan and father's clan
- So you have to conduct yourself accordingly
- It is a matter of great responsibility for daughters who become KULVADHU

### Conduct Guidelines

**Interaction with Men:**

- Can you freely mingle with men? No
- You have to be very reserved
- You have to not interact freely as a KULVADHU with men outside the family
- Even within the family, you have to be very reserved while dealing with men other than the husband
- Not in front of father-in-law or elder brother-in-law
- You have to be very reserved, keep to yourself, be honorable
- Your conduct should be honorable

**Dress Code:**

- She has to be the KULVADHU, has to be properly dressed with all the markers of a SUHAGAN
- SINDUR should be visibly dripping, red CHUNNI should be there, jewelry should be there, MANGALSUTRA should be there
- You must look like a SUHAGAN dressed appropriately

**Responsibilities:**

- The KULVADHU must not do anything which brings disrepute to the clan
- She must religiously follow all rituals, conform to the societal norms and expectations
- Conform to the societal norms, live up to the society expectations
- She has to maintain distance from other men

### Modern Changes

**Contemporary Developments:**

- Important changes have taken place as regards the notions of KANYA DAAN and KULVADHU
- Changes have taken place as regards KANYA DAAN and the KANYA DAAN ceremony and the KULVADHU

**Changes in KANYA DAAN:**

- Now people frequently consume water before KANYA DAAN
- You are supposed to maintain a fast, but now they don't
- Sometimes even food is consumed
- The parents or guardians who are performing the KANYA DAAN are supposed to maintain a fast, but now they don't

**Feminist Criticism:**

- This ceremony of KANYA DAAN has come under criticism from feminists
- Why? It objectifies women
- Are girls some object that they can be given in donation?
- KANYA DAAN objectifies women - they are treated as if they are property whose ownership and control is being transferred from one man (the father) to another (the husband)
- So it shows objectification of women and their clear subordination to men

**Historical Perspective:**

- Critics also point out that things were different - this is not how things were in ancient times
- In olden times, women were pretty empowered
- For example, you had ceremonies like SWAYAMVARA where women used to select the groom
- SWAYAMVARA - the bride would select in the SWAYAMVARA
- So there would be men who would line up to be chosen as grooms and the women would use her discretion, her judgment, her preference in groom selection

**Historical Shift:**

- From SWAYAMVARA type ceremony to KANYA DAAN type ceremony, a shift has occurred
- In olden times, women had agency in mate selection, they were not treated as property
- But in later texts, later Hindu scriptures and law books such as the MANUSMRITI, the status of women was downgraded

### Contemporary KULVADHU

**Modern Changes:**

- Now with modernization, the status of the daughter-in-law, the expected conduct from the daughter-in-law in high status and cultured families has also changed
- Who was KULVADHU? Those who were daughters-in-law of good families, they were called KULVADHU
- Now also there are daughters-in-law of big houses, but are they like that?

**Modern Characteristics:**

- You would know many women who are married in high status families
- Now days, the bride and the daughter-in-law of high status, high cultured families are often educated, modern, fairly westernized also, aware of her rights, also aware of feminist ideology

**Relaxed Restrictions:**

- Does she observe so many restrictions? No, or not as much
- For example, do women (married women of high status families) freely interact with men other than their husbands? Yes, they do
- Even in public, even the societal expectations have changed

**Modern Family Attitudes:**

- Now what do they say in big houses that "we don't want a daughter-in-law, we want a daughter"
- It's become so clichéd, we all know it
- In other words, that we treat our daughters and daughters-in-law equally
- If your daughter wears jeans, so what, our daughter also wears jeans, so as a daughter-in-law also she can wear western clothes up to jeans

**Current Trend:**

- Increasingly, the trend in high status families is that the behavioral expectations from and the treatment of the daughter-in-law is similar to that of the daughter
- There is still difference in expectations but at least lip service is being paid and it is expressed that we treat and expect the same from the daughter and the daughter-in-law

## TYPES OF HINDU MARRIAGE (69:09)

- There are eight forms of marriage among Hindus traditionally
- We have never had a question on that, so if you permit, I will simply share a PDF
- It's very rote learning - there is nothing much to be explained
- These are just one-liners and also unimportant from the exam point of view
- In the sense, there is no precedence that they would have been asked

### Desirable Forms (Four Types)

**Four are desirable and more acceptable forms of marriage:**

1. **BRAHMA Marriage**: The father of the bride gives his daughter to a learned man of good character from the same kind of community and social circle
2. **DAIVA Marriage**: He gives his daughter to a BRAHMIN priest
3. **ARSHA Marriage**: (Brief overview provided)
4. **PRAJAPATI Marriage**: (Brief overview provided)
- All four are acceptable
- In all of them, the father of the bride is involved, he has a major role to play and he does the groom selection

### Less Preferred Forms (Four Types)

**Four are less preferred forms of marriage:**

1. **GANDHARVA Marriage**: Basically love marriage. Does not involve parental consent. Boy and girl fall in love, have sex, get married (not necessarily in that order)
2. **ASURA Marriage**: (Involves taking the girl away)
3. **RAKSHASA Marriage**: (Involves taking the girl away)
4. **PAISHACHA Marriage**: The most grotesque form of marriage. When the girl is sleeping and intoxicated and unconscious, then she is sexually violated followed by marriage. It's like rape then marriage, when she is unable to take a decision
- The first four were types of arranged marriages in modern language
- GANDHARVA marriage is kind of love marriage

## MARRIAGE AMONG MUSLIMS (72:57)

### Basic Characteristics

- **Marriage among Muslims is known as NIKAH**
- **NIKAH sounds eerily similar to VIVAH** (from a poetic point of view)
- **The Muslim marriage is in the nature of a contract - a civil contract**
- Unlike a Hindu marriage which is sacred in character, the Muslim marriage is in the nature of a civil contract

### NIKAHNAMA - The Marriage Contract

- **It is actually a signed contract, and the matrimonial contract document is known as NIKAHNAMA**
- **NIKAHNAMA**: NAMA literally means contract or document
- Like KIRAYANAMA (when you take a room, you get a lease document or rent agreement)
- Similarly, NIKAHNAMA is the matrimonial contract or matrimonial agreement

**Contract Features:**

- Like any other contract, the matrimonial contract and the NIKAHNAMA also lays down the rights and obligations of both parties
- In a typical NIKAHNAMA, the terms of the contract can vary, of course, like in any contract
- So it is up to the two of us what are the terms we agree upon

### Typical Obligations in NIKAHNAMA

**Groom's Obligations Include:**

- To provide a roof
- To provide daily sustenance for the wife and any children born of their union
- The husband will arrange for housing, food, and everything

**Bride's Obligations Include:**

- To cook food
- Take care of the children
- Look after the household

### MAHR (Dower)

- **The NIKAHNAMA also specifies MAHR**
- **MAHR**: A fixed amount decided upon between the two parties which is to be paid by the groom to the bride
- It's a fixed amount to be paid by the groom to the bride

**Not a Bride Price:**

- Does MAHR indicate commodification of women? Is it like a bride price which is being paid to procure a bride?
- Is the wife being bought by paying a price?
- **The answer is no. It is not considered as a bride price and as a payment to procure a bride**
- **It is not in the nature of a payment to procure a bride**

**Purpose of MAHR:**

- **MAHR is considered as a right of the woman**
- **It is meant to secure her financial condition in the matrimonial home**
- It is to secure her position, her financial condition in the matrimonial home
- If commodification was happening, the payment would go to the father or guardian, but MAHR goes to the bride

**Payment Terms:**

- **MAHR can be paid either at the time of the NIKAH or any other specified mutually agreed upon time**

### Religious Aspects

- Muslim marriage, unlike Hindu marriage, is not regarded as sacred
- It is contractual, but even so, it is not completely devoid of religiosity
- It's not that it has nothing to do with religion

**Role of QAZI:**

- The marriage ceremony is officiated by a QAZI
- The marriage ceremony among Muslims is officiated or solemnized by a QAZI (a Muslim priest or learned man)
- You have heard the saying "MIAN BIWI RAZI TO KYA KAREGA QAZI" - he is that QAZI
- But unlike what the saying suggests, he plays a very important role in a Muslim marriage

### Consent and Validity

- **A woman cannot be forced to enter into marriage**
- **Her consent or QUBOOL is essential for a valid matrimonial contract**
- Essential for a valid matrimonial contract

**Role of WALI:**

- The QAZI plays a role, then the WALI
- **WALI**: Literally guardian (also called WALID)
- He is like an elder, typically the father, but in the absence of father, an elder male member of the family
- WALI (guardian) also plays an important role in the selection of the groom

**Witnesses:**

- The Muslim matrimonial contract (NIKAHNAMA) is entered into in the presence of witnesses
- Like other contracts, to be valid, have to have witnesses
- Similarly, the matrimonial contract or NIKAHNAMA is entered into in the presence of witnesses
- Both parties sign the NIKAHNAMA in the presence of witnesses

### Dissolution

- **The Muslim marriage is dissoluble**
- If you and I enter into a contract and we are unable to - either of the parties is not satisfied with the performance of the contract, can any contract be dissolved and ended? Yes
- Similarly, the Muslim marriage can be dissolved
- **In other words, divorce is possible and provided for among Muslims**
- There are various types of divorce
- The one which has been banned (instant triple talaq) is only one of many

## POSITION OF WOMEN IN MUSLIM MARRIAGE (83:34)

### Different Perspectives

**According to Islamic Feminists:**

- Women have been granted several rights
- A large number of rights have been granted to women in Islam
- Marriage-related and in general in social life also

**Rights Granted:**

- Muslim women have a right to maintenance
- They have a right to seek divorce
- They have a right to property
- Right to read scriptures

**Islamic Framework:**

- Islam in that sense is somewhat in sync with the idea of gender equality

### Social Reality vs Theory

**Actual Conditions:**

- But in social reality, Muslim women are worse off than women of various other communities
- For example, Muslim women are far less educated, have less property ownership
- They are not even aware of their rights, whether in Islam or in the constitutional legal framework

**Disadvantaged Position:**

- In society, Muslim women are significantly disadvantaged and often so more than Hindu women (their Hindu counterparts)

### Criticism of Islamic Law

**Critics' Arguments:**

- Critics argue that it's not just a difference in theory and practice
- That theory says Islam is very good or pro-women, but social reality is that it's being violated
- According to critics, even in theory or the religious framework - the legal religious framework (Islamic jurisprudence) - women are disadvantaged

**Examples of Discrimination:**

- In Islamic law, a female witness is not equal in value to a male witness
- Two Muslim women are equal to one Muslim man as a witness
- Muslim men are permitted polygamy, Muslim women are not permitted polygamy
- Muslim men can marry up to four women at a time
- A Muslim woman can't marry four men at a time

**Marriage Restrictions:**

- A Muslim man can marry any KITABIA woman
- **KITABIA**: Those religions which are religions of a book (basically Judaism, Christianity, and Islam)
- These are regarded as KITABIA religions which have a central sacred scripture: the TORAH, the BIBLE, and the QURAN respectively
- These are called KITABI religions or religions of the book
- A Muslim man can legally marry a Christian woman, a Jewish woman, and a Muslim woman
- **But a Muslim woman can only marry a Muslim man** - she cannot marry a Jew and a Christian

### Discriminatory Customs and Practices

**Recent Practices:**

- Apart from this, there are several discriminatory customs and practices
- Such as, till recently, triple talaq
- Why am I mentioning them separately? Because according to critics and scholars of Islam, these are not sanctioned by QURAN and HADIS
- That's why we are counting them in customs and practices

**Examples:**

1. **NIKAH HALALA**: If a woman divorces her husband (a Muslim woman is divorced by her Muslim husband) and she wants to reunite with him, then before she can reunite with the husband she has been divorced by, she has to first get married to another person, consummate that marriage, and get divorced from that other person, and then only she can remarry her first husband
   
   - This practice has been misused allegedly by Muslim clerics who have done it for sexual exploitation of Muslim women and also for money

2. **Instant Triple Talaq**: (Now banned)

## DIVERSITY OF MARRIAGES IN INDIA (92:46)

### Religious Diversity

- We have discussed in some detail only Hindu and Muslim marriage

- But there are various types of marriage ceremonies, practices, expectations based on religious communities:
  
  - Christian marriage
  - Parsi marriage  
  - Buddhist marriage
  - ARYA SAMAJI marriage
  - Sikh marriage
  - Jain marriage

- Different religions would have a variety of marriage ceremonies, practices, customs, etc.

### Tribal Variations

- Tribals have different marriage customs

### Non-Religious Marriages

- Non-religious marriages or civil unions are also possible
- Civil marriage, court marriage

### Based on Number of Spouses

**MONOGAMY:**

- Where one man is married to one woman
- Single marriage

**Historical Context:**

- In 1955, the Hindu Marriage Act was passed
- Before that, Hindu men were legally allowed to marry more than one woman
- But it wasn't a popular practice - it wasn't a popular practice
- Technically or legally, Hindu men were allowed to marry more than one woman
- But after 1955, with this law, monogamy has been laid down by law for Hindus

**Scope of Hindu Marriage Act:**

- When I say Hindu, it includes Sikh, Buddhist, and Jain
- The term Hindu in such contexts includes, apart from Hindus (followers of Hinduism), Buddhist, Sikh, and Jain also

**Other Communities:**

- If you look at social practice in India, Christians and Parsis also strictly follow monogamy

### POLYGAMY

- **POLYGAMY**: Multiple marriages (POLY means multiple, GAMY means marriages)
- When you have more than one marriages, that is polygamy
- Polygamy can be of two types:

**1. POLYGYNY:**

- The term GYNI is the suffix for women and female-related things
- POLYGYNY means multiple women - multiple wives
- In other words, POLYGYNY is when one man marries multiple women

**Muslim Context:**

- POLYGYNY is allowed amongst Muslims
- A Muslim man is allowed to marry four women
- He can have at one point of time four wives
- Provided that all are treated equally (which is impossible)
- So Muslims are allowed polygamy, but it is practiced by a very small fraction of the Indian Muslim population

**Myth vs Reality:**

- A lot of myth-making develops around it - four wives, 16 children
- The threat of Muslim demographic overrun and Muslims outdoing Hindus and overtaking Hindus is highlighted using the legally permissible practice of four marriages among Muslims
- But actual practice is very less
- Who would do it? The rich and powerful, those who can afford to maintain four wives

**2. POLYANDRY:**

- POLY ANDRY means one woman having multiple husbands
- The suffix ANDRO/ANDRI denotes men
- POLYANDRY can be of two types:

**a. Fraternal Polyandry:**

- When a woman marries men who are brothers to each other
- The example you have in mind of DRAUPADI in MAHABHARATA is correct - that is an example of fraternal polyandry
- It is practiced by the KHASA of JAUNSAR BAWAR in Dehradun

**b. Non-Fraternal Polyandry:**

- When a woman marries men who are not brothers
- For example, it is allowed among the NAIRS of Kerala

### Other Forms

**Cross-Cousin Marriage:**

- Cross-cousin marriages are allowed among GONDS of Madhya Pradesh, ORAON, KHARIA
- Certain tribes and also communities in South India

**Parallel Cousin Marriage:**

- Among Muslims, parallel cousin marriage is also allowed
- Even parallel cousin is rarer, but it is allowed
- It is rare in society among communities - very few societies allow it
- Muslim society allows it

**LEVIRATE:**

- Where a man marries elder brother's widow
- We have discussed earlier, names of communities

**SORORATE:**

- Where a widower marries the younger sister of his deceased wife
- After his wife's death, marrying his younger sister-in-law
- They don't marry the elder one because the presumption is the younger one might be unmarried
- The elder one would have already been settled
- This is practiced among GONDS and BAIGA in Central India

- Most Muslims you will find are monogamous

### Arranged vs Love Marriages

**Current Scenario:**

- In our society, which marriages take place - arranged or love?
- Still arranged, but with a difference
- **Arranged marriages with increasing role of the bride-to-be and groom-to-be having an increasing say in the mate selection process**
- Earlier they were told at what time to get ready
- Now they are told "Do you like the boy/girl or not?" and so on
- Increasing say and increasing involvement of the boy and the girl in the mate selection process
- Arranged marriage but with an increasing say and increasing role

### Inter-Regional Marriages

- **Increase in across-region marriages**
- Example: "I have two sisters, both are married in Bombay and settled in Bombay, which is very far from Delhi. Why? Better boy was found there. And how did we find a boy from Bombay? Technology, newspapers at that time"
- **Across-region marriages are increasing**
- **It has been made possible by modern technologies**

**Significance:**

- This has a very significant bearing
- Across regions, there are significant variations in kinship patterns
- If a Delhi girl is going to Bombay (Northern kinship zone girl going to Southern/Central kinship zone), it will create new kinds of relationships
- How will those relationships be managed in future generations?
- What marriage rules will be followed? What kinship patterns will be followed?
- All of that is significantly affected when inter-regional marriages take place

### Impact on Kinship Rules

- Due to such marriages, close kin are now living far apart
- The girl is miles away from her parents
- In North, there has always been village exogamy culture, so it's fine
- There is expectation or mental preparation that the girl will go to her in-laws' place or go far
- But not this far - it was like next village or conventionally skipping four villages
- Now she is going miles away, even abroad

**Flexibility in Rules:**

- What would you expect in such kind of marriages (inter-regional marriages) when kinship rules and patterns are region-specific?
- They will be followed to a greater extent or lesser extent? Lesser extent
- They are followed to a lesser extent
- That rigidity reduces a bit
- Inter-regional couples are more accommodating, more flexible
- "Neither yours nor mine, let's leave it"
- Because kinship rules and patterns are region-specific, so they tend to get loosened

### Expanding Circle of Endogamy

- The circle of endogamy is widening/expanding

### New Trends

**Emerging Patterns:**

- New things are happening:
  - **Inter-faith marriages** (lovingly called love jihad)
  - **Inter-caste marriages**
  - **Same-sex unions**
  - **Divorce** (increasing but not widely prevalent)

**Reality Check:**

- These are all rare, but happening
- Same-sex unions would happen secretly, not openly
- Same-sex unions, inter-caste, inter-religion, divorce - all these are rare but it's an increasing trend
- Many of us would personally know couples who are divorced or on the verge of divorce
- Not celebrities like PREETI ZINTA types, but people in our known circles, our caste and community

## DESCENT AND LINEAGE (133:21)

### Basic Definitions

**DESCENT:**

- The two terms DESCENT and LINEAGE are very closely related though they do not refer exactly to the same thing
- The concepts of DESCENT and LINEAGE are closely related though they are not the same thing

**DESCENT Defined:**

- **DESCENT refers to the principle and rule by which a person is associated with the group of his and her parents and traces his ancestry**
- DESCENT specifies the relationship defined by connection to an ancestor through a culturally recognized sequence of parent-child links
- **DESCENT indicates automatic recruitment of an individual into a social group on birth**
- It's automatic - there was no choice and negotiation whether to become grandfather's or maternal grandfather's

**LINEAGE Defined:**

- **LINEAGE consists of all the descendants of a person in a particular line**
- All members of a lineage trace their ancestry to a single person

### Significance and Roles

**Functions of Descent System:**

- It determines group membership
- It is a source of social identity
- It provides group membership  
- It lays down the rules for transfer of property
- It helps in regulating marriage
- It is a source of social solidarity and support
- Members of a lineage come together for collective worship of family ancestors
- They also help to resolve disputes within the descent group

**Dispute Resolution:**

- What disputes occur? Property disputes
- When two cousin brothers are fighting, what do they say? "Let's sit the elder family members"
- Some old coughing man will come and sit in judgment and heal, saying "You take this much, you take that" - then both, respecting his honor and seniority, agree
- Instead of dragging each other to court for three generations

## TYPES OF DESCENT SYSTEMS (144:40)

### 1. Unilineal Descent

- **UNILINEAL DESCENT**: Descent is traced through any one parent (one line)
- Unilineal can be of two types:
  - **PATRILINEAL**: Father's line
  - **MATRILINEAL**: Mother's line

### 2. Double Unilineal Descent

- **In double unilineal descent, the child is associated with the group of one parent for some purposes and with the group of the other parent for some other purposes**
- For example, property transfer through father's side and ritual role (ceremonial role) through mother's side
- Example: **TODAS of Kerala** have double unilineal descent

### 3. Bilateral Descent

- **The child is considered as a member of both the father's group and the mother's group equally**
- For example: **DIMASA KACHARI in Assam and Nagaland**

### 4. Ambilineal Descent

- **AMBI**: Either (like ambidextrous - one who can write with either hand)
- **In this, the child can choose to belong to either the father's group or the mother's group**
- For example: **TIWA LALUNG in Assam and Meghalaya**

### Most Common Systems

- **Most common worldwide and in India**: Unilineal descent system
- **Within unilineal, patrilineal descent is the most common**
- **Least common**: Ambilineal (if a child has to make so many major decisions from childhood, the mind will get spoiled)

## CONCEPTUAL ISSUES REGARDING LINEAGE AND DESCENT IN INDIA (151:09)

### British Anthropological Influence

- **Lineage and descent studies in India were significantly influenced by British anthropology**
- Lineage and descent studies in India were significantly influenced by the British anthropological tradition
- **The British anthropologists suffered from a functional bias**
- So following British anthropologists, lineage and descent studies in India also reflect a functional bias

**Example of Functional Bias:**

- For example, descent groups also have a lot of fights, but there wasn't much emphasis on that
- There was greater focus on coordination, cooperation, and functional aspects

### Study Focus Issues

- **British anthropologists were primarily studying African or Oceanic tribes**
- Some of the prominent anthropologists who influenced lineage and descent studies in India include **A.R. RADCLIFFE-BROWN, MALINOWSKI, EVANS-PRITCHARD, and MEYER FORTES**
- They basically were studying lineage and descent systems in Africa or Oceania

**Problem with Imported Tradition:**

- The same tradition was imported in the Indian context
- **It does not take into account the peculiarities of Indian society**
- Simply write that we are very heavily influenced by the British tradition with studies of lineage and descent in Oceania and Africa, so does not take into account the peculiarities of Indian society

### Specific Indian Issues

**1. Emphasis on Blood Ties vs Affinal Relations:**

- In Africa, descent was far more important than alliance
- Descent was far more important and organizing principle for society than alliance
- Alliance means marriage - consanguineal kin were much more important than affinal kin
- In India, when descent studies started, much greater emphasis was given to blood ties

**Explanation for Blood Tie Importance:**

- One explanation offered why blood ties are more important in India: because we are a patrilineal society
- For me, my father's side is more important than wife's side people

**Indian Reality:**

- But please appreciate that in the Indian cultural context, **certain affinal relations play an important role in a patrilineal society**
- **Certain affinal relations are very important within a patrilineal framework**
- No denying patrilineality, but despite that, some marriage-established relationships are very important

### Important Affinal Relations

**MAMA (Maternal Uncle):**

- In North India, we are heavily patrilineal, but **MAMA (the mother's brother) is a very important figure for the nephew and niece (for his sister's children)**
- If I am the ego, my mother's brother plays a very important role in my life, whether I am a male ego or a female ego
- **Maternal uncle plays a very important role** - like giving BHAAT, BHAAT ceremony
- Don't look at it from a pecuniary and greedy perspective, but point is it symbolically shows the centrality of the role of MAMA in the child's life

**SALA (Brother-in-law):**

- Similarly, they say "all digging on one side, wife's brother on one side"
- **SALA is not secondary in the Indian scheme of things**
- Clearly he is no match to son-in-law and brother-in-law, but he is an important edge in brother-in-law's life and sister's life
- You can trust SALA more than even brother - his sister is with you as mortgage/guarantee

**De-emphasis in Studies:**

- Following Africa, Indian anthropology or descent studies have somewhat de-emphasized MAMA's role or affinal kin's role in general
- It has not been sufficiently explored and elaborated

### Fictive Kinship

- **Another Indian peculiarity (not unique to India, but important) is what is called FICTIVE KINSHIP**
- **FICTIVE KINSHIP**: Those who are not really kin - they are not related to the ego by blood and ties of blood and marriage, but they are considered to be kin

**MUNH BOLA BHAI (Adopted Brother):**

- For example, **MUNH BOLA BHAI** - somebody whom you regard as a brother who is not really your brother but is regarded as a brother
- What we in modern times also call RAKHI BHAI (RAKHI brother)
- Some person in school - you may have certain boys whom you start tying RAKHI to
- So they are RAKHI brothers and sisters or MUNH BOLE BHAI-BEHEN

**Purpose of Fictive Kinship:**

- Why do we have MUNH BOLE BHAI-BEHEN? Because in the Northern zone, the rule is village exogamy
- So a woman is married off in another village where she is cut off completely and very far from her natal home
- In the village where she gets married, she is a complete stranger, she knows nobody
- So she is completely alone and forever riddled with anxiety that she might make some mistake, someone might get angry - mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, husband, anybody

**Psychological Support:**

- Women used to consider some person in the village as MUNH BOLA BHAI
- That would offer them psychological and emotional support
- Can't do much practically for girls/brothers, but some sort of psychological support that you have someone in the same village who is a kin, a brother, who is like a brother
- People really internalize that fictive kinship and follow it

### Model vs Reality Gap

**Significant Differences:**

- **Sometimes there is significant difference between the models developed by descent theory and the personal experiences of the members of the society**
- **Sometimes social kinship patterns vary very significantly from the normative models**

**Examples:**

- Model says that those who belong to the same lineage offer support, numerical strength, backing role in fights
- Practically, many people will tell you they don't support, don't stand together, take neutral stance in the village

**Real Experiences:**

- Some of us may have experienced that real uncles or people from our own group didn't stand with us when we were fighting with a stranger
- Model says women in North are very suppressed, very scared, very covered
- We may not necessarily always be so

### Joking Relationships

**Northern India Context:**

- In North India, where women are considered as particularly under strong patriarchal controls, there are very popular **joking relationships**
- Joking relationships often involve even a newly wed bride with some teasing and banter
- There's sweet and sour interaction, joking and teasing

**DEVAR-BHABHI Relationship:**

- Like the relationship between DEVAR and BHABHI (younger brother-in-law and sister-in-law)
- That is a joking relationship

**Contrast in Relationships:**

- According to some commentators, why does that joking relationship exist?
- **It is a potentially sexual relationship**
- If a woman is unsatisfied in marriage, she can find - from the moment she enters the house, she has a very teasing kind of relationship with her DEVAR (husband's younger brother)

**Avoidance vs Joking:**

- In contrast with the elder brother and father-in-law, she has **avoidance relationship**
- Elder brother (JETH) and father-in-law - she has an avoidance relationship
- She has to avoid intimacy, close contact, and free exchange with her husband's elder brother and father-in-law
- But she has a very free and open teasing relationship with DEVAR (husband's younger brother)

**Power Structure Explanation:**

- Why doesn't she have a teasing relationship with JETH but with DEVAR?
- **It's the power structure within the family**
- Father-in-law and husband's elder brother are higher in status, authority, and power than the husband because they are senior age/generation-wise
- If the bride gets very pally with these guys, then they can override the authority of the husband
- So she should avoid them only
- **Younger brother cannot dare to override the elder brother**
- So any sexual relationship, if it is to be established, has to be at the initiative of the woman
- DEVAR cannot take on his elder brother, but if the woman wants, she can

**Cultural Manifestation:**

- That's why, for example, we have such a popular category of BHABHI content in entertainment
- It's a fantasy for many young men that there is an unsatisfied BHABHI who is sexually unfulfilled, so you find its cultural roots there
