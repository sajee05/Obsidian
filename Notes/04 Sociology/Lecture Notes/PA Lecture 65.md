# The Household Dimension of Family in India and Position of Women

## CONTINUATION FROM PREVIOUS LECTURE: JOINT VS NUCLEAR FAMILIES (09:34)

- The last topic covered was discussing whether joint families have been nuclearized
- **Last thing covered**: Moving beyond Pauline Kolenda to AM Shah's views
- **Key observation**: The examples taken to say that joint families are still compatible with modern times were all business families or agriculture-based families
- **Argument**: These studies show that industrialization and joint family structure are not incompatible
- **Important point**: Even middle-class families who need to be mobile retain functional jointness, even if not spatially staying under the same roof
- The jointness sentiment still reigns even in modern mobile families

## HOUSEHOLD DIMENSION OF FAMILY - AM SHAH'S VIEWS (11:37)

- **Questions have been asked time and again from this portion in the exam**
- This primarily deals with the views of **AM SHAH** who wrote a book titled **"The Household Dimension of Family in India"**

### The Process View of Family

- **AM Shah's main argument**: We should not necessarily be classifying families as nuclear and joint
- **Reason**: Any given family would typically have a certain life cycle
- **During its course**: Any given family will undergo changes in size and composition
- The same family may become big at certain times and it may become smaller at other times

**Personal Example Provided**:

- Started as an 8-member three-generation joint family (grandparents, parents, four siblings)
- Became 7-member when grandfather passed away
- Became nuclear 6-member family when grandmother passed away
- Became 5-member when eldest sister got married
- Became 4-member when other sister got married
- Became 5-member joint family when brother got married
- Became 6-member three-generation joint family when brother had a child

### Key Principles of the Process View

**AM Shah suggests that every household passes through various stages in its developmental life cycle. These changes occur due to a variety of factors and affect the size and composition of the household throughout its life cycle.**

**The household may expand in size due to**:

- Birth
- In-marriage (when a woman joins the household)
- Adoption (rarer)

**It may shrink in size due to**:

- Death
- Out-marriage (when a daughter marries and goes out)

**Thus, every household is engaged in a continuous process of expansion and shrinking, fission and fusion during its life cycle.**

- **Fission**: Breaking up (brothers separating due to differences or lack of space)
- **Fusion**: Families coming back together (elderly parent moving back with children after spouse's demise, end of an out-marriage)

### Factors Affecting Household Development

**According to Shah, the process of development of the household is affected by various factors such as:**

1. **Demographic factors**
   
   - MMR (Maternal Mortality Rate), IMR (Infant Mortality Rate)
   - Life expectancy in society
   - Fertility behavior of population

2. **Social rules governing residence**
   
   - In our society: Patrilocal residence (newlyweds reside in groom's house)
   - Women get added to households after marriage
   - Daughters get subtracted from natal households after marriage

3. **Interpersonal relations**
   
   - Whether people are able to gel well together
   - Fathers and sons, brothers relationships
   - People split if not getting along

**This is known as the process view of the family.**

### Other Scholars Supporting Process View

**Scholars who have also subscribed to this process view:**

- **KM Kapadia**
- **MSG**
- **IP Desai**

## PREFERENCE FOR TERM "HOUSEHOLD" OVER "FAMILY" (26:31)

### AM Shah's Argument for Using "Household"

**AM Shah highlights that the term family has multiple meanings attached to it. The term family is widely used by ordinary people and social scientists alike.**

**The term family has been used in at least four different ways as follows:**

1. **To refer to a group of people living under the same roof**
2. **For the social group comprising of parents and children whether living together or apart**
3. **As a kinship unit, including all those who are related by blood and marriage**
4. **As a common lineage**

**Consequently, the meaning of the term family is unclear and confusing.**

### Benefits of Using "Household"

**Concept of household has two major benefits:**

1. **It is not in common usage** - Can be precisely defined
2. **We have wealth of information for empirical investigation from census operations**
- Census is conducted every 10 years since 1865 (first was 1872, then 1881 onwards till 2011)
- We have empirical data spanning 100+ years regarding households

## DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF HOUSEHOLDS (38:21)

### Census Definition

**According to the census, a household is a group of persons who normally live together and take their meals from a common kitchen.**

### Difference Between Family and Household

| Aspect              | Family                                              | Household                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Membership**      | Necessarily a kinship group (related to each other) | May be related or may not be related, or mix of both |
| **Composition**     | Only relatives                                      | Can include servants, non-relatives                  |
| **Emotional Bonds** | Family members typically have emotional bonds       | May or may not have emotional bonds                  |
| **Example**         | Parents, children, relatives                        | PG residents, family + servant                       |

### Types of Households (Census of India)

**Households can be classified into three types:**

1. **Normal households** - Those who live under same roof and eat food from common kitchen (same as family)
2. **Institutional households** - PGs, jails, dhamshalas, boarding houses, old age homes, children's homes
3. **Houseless households** - Homeless population living on pavements, pipes, railway platforms

### Modern Living Arrangements

- **Same-sex couples, live-in relationships** - Will fit into household category
- **Single person household** - Household can comprise of a single person
- **Family** - Is a social unit with emotional connections

## CENSUS DATA ON HOUSEHOLD SIZES (47:10)

### Current Household Size Statistics

**Average household size in India:**

- **Rural India**: 4.9 persons per household
- **Urban India**: 4.6 persons per household
- **All India average**: 4.8 persons per household

**State-wise highest average household sizes:**

1. **Uttar Pradesh**: 6 persons per household
2. **Jammu and Kashmir**: 5.8 persons per household

### Historical Trends in Household Size

| Year     | Average Household Size |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| **1951** | 4.8 persons            |
| **1981** | 5.5 persons (peak)     |
| **2011** | 4.8 persons            |

- Household size increased till 1981, then showed declining trend to reach 4.8 again

### Household Composition by Married Couples

**Total households in India (2011 Census): 24.8 crore**

- **Urban households**: 8 crore
- **Rural households**: 16.8 crore

**Distribution by married couples:**

- **Households with one married couple**: 17.3 crore
- **Households with zero married couples**: 2.8 crore  
- **Households with two or more married couples**: 4.7 crore (can be safely assumed as joint)

## CONCLUSION ON INDIAN FAMILY SYSTEM (56:40)

**The family system in India has undergone tremendous changes. While people are increasingly residing in nuclear households, they still greatly value kinship beyond the nuclear unit.**

**In Indian society, the joint family sentiment and feeling remains strong. Even though people may be unable to stay jointly, the joint family continues to be hailed as a family ideal.**

**The Indian family today is neither the traditional joint family nor is it the modern isolated nuclear family. The Indian family is a transitional family characterized by:**

- Nuclear residence
- Functional jointness  
- Increase in the age of marriage
- Strengthening of the conjugal bond
- Improvement of the position of women within the family
- The family getting relatively more egalitarian

## POSITION OF WOMEN IN INDIAN SOCIETY (69:20)

### Women's Position Within the Family

**The Indian family continues to be patriarchal:**

- **Authority structure**: Major decisions taken by men (property ownership, disposal)
- **Patrilineal**: Lineage traced through male line, belong to father's social group
- **Patrilocal residence**: After marriage, couples reside with husband's family
- **Son preference**: Reflected in female feticide, female infanticide, adverse child sex ratio
- **Gendered socialization**: Girl child and boy child raised differently, reinforcing gender stereotypes

### Violence Against Women in Family

**Violence against women takes place within the family in various forms:**

- **Female feticide** (starts before birth in the womb)
- **Female infanticide** 
- **Wife beating**
- **Marital rape**
- **Dowry-related violence**

#### Domestic Violence Statistics (NFHS-5)

- **29% women face spousal violence**
- **In 14 out of 18 states, more than 30% women justified husbands beating their wives**

**Wife beating is justified on various grounds such as:**

- Going out without informing husband
- Not cooking food properly  
- Disrespecting his parents (in-laws)

**State-wise data on women justifying domestic violence:**

- **Telangana, Andhra Pradesh**: 84% women
- **Karnataka**: 77% women

### The Missing Women Campaign

**Ritu Banerjee launched the 50 million missing campaign:**

- **50 million women in South Asia are missing** (roughly 4-5% of population)
- Removed from society by practices like female feticide, female infanticide, dowry murders
- **She calls it the largest ongoing genocide in the world**

## RELIGION AND WOMEN'S POSITION (98:27)

### Positive Aspects of Indian Religion Towards Women

**Indian religions are respectful towards women in general:**

- **Devi worshipping culture** with numerous female deities
- Women hold important portfolios: **Lakshmi** (wealth), **Saraswati** (knowledge), **Durga/Kali** (power)
- Every male god is worshipped with his female consort
- **Festivals celebrating femininity** such as onset of puberty of young girls
- **Various customs and rituals focused on women**

### Problematic Aspects According to Feminists

**Various religious iconography, customs and rituals in Hinduism also reinforce and justify patriarchy:**

#### Religious Restrictions

- **Priests are all men** - women denied entry as priests
- **Menstruating women considered impure**
- **Widows considered inauspicious**
- **Lakshmi portrayed as subordinate to Vishnu**

#### Religious Customs Reinforcing Patriarchy

- **Karva Chauth**: Women keep fast for long lives of husbands (no equivalent fasts for wives)
- **Women portrayed as bhuj** (dependent, needing protection)
- **Husband called "Pati"** (means owner) and **"Swami"** (supreme lord)
- **Putting sindoor considered greatest bliss for women**
- **Customs portray becoming wife and mother as ultimate goal**

#### Virginity and Purity Emphasis

- **Kanya Puja**: Worship of pre-puberty girls puts premium on virginity
- **After puberty, women deemed dangerous**
- **Menstruation taboos** - girls cannot enter temples while menstruating
- **Marriage rituals**: Bengali bride throws rice back, symbolically paying debt to father

#### Religious Texts and Women

**Uma Chakravarti highlights that religious texts like Manusmriti provide ideological basis for patriarchal controls:**

**Manusmriti passages:**

- Woman should remain under control of father (young), husband (adult), son (widowhood)
- Women not capable of independence
- Even weak men must control their wives
- Women by nature are lustful and deceitful
- **"Dhol, gavar, shudra, nari - ye sab tadan ke adhikari"** (drum, illiterate, shudra, women - all deserve to be beaten)

#### Temple Prostitution

**Devadasi system interpreted as system of temple prostitution:**

- Young girls married to deity symbolically
- Then subjected to sexual exploitation by priestly class

#### Mythology and Women

**Women are commodified in mythology:**

- **Draupadi**: Shared by five brothers, bet during dice game, disrobed publicly
- **Sita**: Despite being devoted wife, subjected to agni pariksha, later abandoned on suspicion
- **Kanyadan**: Father transferring ownership of girl to another man

### Scholarly Perspectives

**Subhadra Channa**: Women subjected to **Devi-Dasi dichotomy** - worshipped as goddesses on one hand, treated as slaves/property on the other

**Kamla Bhasin**: All religions including Hinduism are patriarchal, women portrayed as subordinate to men

## CASTE AND WOMEN (130:14)

### Brahmanical Patriarchy Concept

**Uma Chakravarti developed concept of brahmanical patriarchy:**

- **Caste hierarchy and gender hierarchy work together** to build brahmanical social order in ancient India
- **Important for high caste to control women's sexuality** to ensure purity of caste

### Three Ways High Caste Controlled Women's Sexuality

1. **Ideological conditioning** - Notion of pativrata (dedicated to husband alone)
2. **Use of violence** - Allowed/condoned by dharma shastras like Manusmriti  
3. **King's power** - Ultimate power to punish women deviating from wifely duties

**High caste women frequently treated at par with shudras**

### Dr. Ambedkar's Connection

- **Caste endogamy** requires patriarchal practices
- To deal with surplus men/women: sati, enforced widowhood, marrying young girls to older men

## LEELA DUBE'S ANALYSIS OF PATRIARCHY (138:29)

### Seed-Earth Analogy in Patrilineal India

**In patrilineal India, there is concept of seed and earth in reproduction:**

- **Man considered as providing seed**
- **Woman considered as earth receiving the seed** 
- **Man seen as active agent, rightful owner of child**
- **Man's blood perceived in child's body**
- **Woman seen merely as receptacle/vessel** temporarily holding man's seed

### Impact on Family Relations

#### In Natal Family

- **Girl viewed as transferable** (will leave the house)
- **Therefore nonfunctional for natal family** for purpose of continuity of family lineage
- **Boy child continues family lineage** because he carries the seed

#### In Husband's Family

- **Wife seen in instrumental terms**
- **Merely carrier of husband's seed**

**Gender differences are culturally produced but interpreted as being rooted in biology and therefore natural**

### Socialization of Girl Child

**From very young age, girl child learns the special value of the male child**

**Girl child is socialized in gendered way through rituals, ceremonies and language to recognize importance of male child and her position relative to men**

#### Examples of Gendered Language

- **"Paraya dhan"** (another person's property) - how girl children are referred to
- **"This is not your house"** - continuously told she's temporary member
- **Blessings**: "Hazaron putra ki mata ho" (may you be mother of thousand sons)
- **Suhagan** (married women with living husbands) considered blessed
- **Widows considered inauspicious** and barred from auspicious occasions

#### Regional Proverbs Reflecting Attitudes

- **"Father of daughter never remains hungry"** (daughters welcomed to extent)
- **"Daughter after whom son is born is greatly praised"**
- **"Daughter and ghee both valuable but both begin to stink if not disposed of in time"**

#### Festival Songs and Cultural Messages

**Durga Puja/Gauri Puja songs:**

- Parvati seeking Shiva's permission to visit mother
- Indicates **importance of husband's permission** from young age
- **9-day stay indicates temporary nature** of girl's residence at natal home

### Behavioral Expectations for Girls

#### Physical Behavior

- **Walk with soft steps** (not allowed to be jumpy)
- **Careful about posture** - keep knees together while sitting, standing, sleeping
- **Maintain distance from boys** (can be dangerous)
- **Compared to earthen pots** (once defiled, defiled forever) vs boys as brass pots (reusable)

#### Verbal Behavior

- **Speak softly, avoid harsh language**
- **Not talk or laugh loudly**
- **Not be argumentative**

#### Domestic Skills

- **Work in kitchen, care for younger children, do menial housework**
- **Good at cooking, serving, distributing food**
- **Annapurna concept** - notion of sacrifice, self-deprivation
- If limited food, girl should give to father/brother and go hungry

#### Moral Behavior

- **Carefully guarded against even remote resemblance to woman of loose character**
- **Should not whistle, jingle bangles, smile without purpose, glance through corner of eyes**

### Puberty and Marriage Transitions

#### South vs North India Puberty Rituals

- **South India**: Onset of puberty celebrated publicly (indicates readiness for motherhood)
- **North India**: Very hush-hush affair, girl advised restrictions

#### Most Dangerous Period

- **After puberty and before marriage** - girl is most dangerous
- Lot of care regarding how she sits, stands, talks, sleeps, interacts

#### Girls' Insistence on Dowry

- **Girls often insist on dowry** to cement position in new household and acquire elevated status
- Use it to break relations with natal home and establish status in in-laws' home
