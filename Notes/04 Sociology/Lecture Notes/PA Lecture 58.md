| Aspect                   | Caste System       | Class System          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Rate of mobility**     | Lower              | Higher                |
| **Theoretical position** | Prohibits mobility | Provides for mobility |

## Racial Theory Recap (12:00)

- **HERBERT RISLEY's theory**: Fair-skinned, long-nosed Aryans came to India from outside
- **Process**: Conquered local dark-skinned inhabitants, imposed strict non-intermixing rules
- **Result**: Development of caste system through endogamy and hypergamy tolerance

### Scholars Opposing Racial Theory

1. **AMBEDKAR**: Pointed out differences between caste and race
2. **DEEPANKAR GUPTA**: Argued that inter-mixing happens between higher caste women and lower caste men, resulting in offspring getting lower status than father

## Introduction to Various Theories of Caste (14:26)

### Four Main Scholars in Syllabus

1. **GOVIND SADASHIV GHURE** (G.S. GHURE)
2. **LOUIS DUMONT**
3. **M.N. SRINIVAS** 
4. **ANDRE BETEILLE**

## GHURE's Views on Caste (17:07)

### Book Reference

- **Title**: "Caste and Race in India"

### Relationship with RISLEY's Theory

- **GHURE's position**: Partially accepts RISLEY's views but with limitations
- **Applicability**: RISLEY's theory correct only for northern India (Hindustan proper)
- **Regional variation**: 
  - **Northern India**: Racial theory applicable
  - **Southern and Eastern India**: Caste system imposed on already racially intermixed population

### GHURE's Analysis of Regional Differences

**Northern India (Hindustan Proper)**:

- Aryans first imposed caste system and endogamy principle
- Helped maintain racial purity
- Race-caste relationship exists

**Southern and Eastern India**:

- Multiple races had already intermixed before caste system arrived
- Caste system imposed on racially mixed population
- Race-caste relationship does not exist

### Six Physical Types of Hindu Population

| Physical Type     | Location/Description                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Indo-Aryan**    | Rajputana (Rajasthan), Punjab, parts of United Provinces (UP) |
| **Dravidian**     | Tamil and Malayalam people                                    |
| **Pre-Dravidian** | Forest dwellers of South India                                |
| **Western Type**  | People along western coast from Maharashtra to Malabar        |
| **Munda**         | Tribal people of Chota Nagpur plateau                         |
| **Mongoloid**     | Populations in Himalayas, Assam region and Nepal              |

### Examples of Racial Mixing

- **Bihar population**: Mixture of Indo-Aryans, Munda and some traces of Pre-Dravidian
- **Bengal population**: Mix of Munda, Western and Mongoloid type

### Six Features of Caste According to GHURE

1. **Segmental division**: Caste system comprises of a number of closely exclusive segments and social groups whose membership is determined by and at birth

2. **Hierarchy**: Hierarchy of ritual purity

3. **Restrictions on exchange of food and social interactions**: Rules governing beti-vyavahar (marriage) and roti-vyavahar (food sharing)

4. **Lack of unrestricted choice of occupation**: Not complete occupational specification but limited freedom in occupation choice

5. **Restrictions on marriage**: Endogamous marriage rules

6. **Various civil and religious privileges and disabilities**: Different rights for different sections of society

### GHURE's Positive View of Caste

- **Integration function**: Caste system has provided an effective mechanism for integration of diverse social groups
- **Achievement**: Large number of racial and ethnic groups present in Indian society were integrated into a single collective
- **Religious framework**: Hinduism provided the conceptual framework and guidelines for this integration
- **Brahmin role**: Brahmins played a key role in this integration process by their authorship and interpretation of Hindu scriptures

### GHURE's Criticism of Modern Caste

- **Modern disharmony**: Caste system resulting in disharmony in modern society
- **Reason**: Growth of caste-based associations promoting sense of pride in one's caste
- **Problems**: 
  - Encouraging caste patriotism (sense of loyalty and devotion to one's own caste)
  - Protecting interests of their own caste
  - Resulting in caste-based conflicts

## LOUIS DUMONT's Theory (47:01)

### Background and Book

- **Nationality**: French scholar
- **Experience**: Came to India for short visits, stayed in Tamil Nadu and Gorakhpur
- **Languages**: Knew French, Sanskrit and some Tamil
- **Book**: "Homo Hierarchicus"
- **Foundation**: Based on writings of French anthropologists before him, particularly BOUGLE

### Core Argument: Caste as Ideology

- **Primary thesis**: Caste is not so much about social structure arrangement, but is fundamentally an **ideology**
- **Definition**: Caste is a way of thinking, not an aspect of social structure
- **Understanding requirement**: To understand caste, one must understand the way of thinking and ideology that governs it
- **Ideological basis**: This ideology is shaped by religion (Hinduism)

### BOUGLE's Three Features of Caste

1. **Hierarchy**: Ranking system
2. **Division of labor based on hereditary specialization**: Occupational inheritance
3. **Repulsion**: Different caste groups repel each other, wanting to maintain distance

### DUMONT's Central Principle

- **Pan-India ideology**: While there may be regional variations in caste, the underlying ideological principle governing caste is the same throughout India
- **Core principle**: **Opposition of pure and impure**
- **Universal application**: This principle operates despite regional variations across India

### Understanding Purity and Impurity

#### Concept of Purity (Shuddh/Shuddhataa)

- **Associated with**: Cleanliness (shauch)
- **Not limited to**: Physical cleanliness alone

#### Types of Impurity

**1. Permanent Impurity**:

- **Who**: Those born in untouchable castes
- **Reason**: Their occupations involve uncleanliness and menial, dirty tasks
  - Manual scavenging
  - Leather tanning, shoe making
  - Dealing with human dead bodies
  - Skinning animal hides
- **Nature**: Physically defiling tasks, especially those involving bodily excretions

**2. Temporary Impurity**:

- **Applicable to**: Non-untouchable (touchable) castes can become temporarily impure

**Sources of temporary impurity**:

- Touch of untouchable caste person
- Death in family (closer the relation, greater the impurity)
- Birth of child (40-day seclusion period for new mother)
- Menstruation (women considered impure, cannot enter temples)
- Sexual intercourse
- Defecation
- Cutting of nails and hair

#### Characteristics of Purity and Impurity

- **Purity**: Very fragile state, easily disrupted
- **Pollution**: Highly contagious, easily transmitted through:
  - Touch
  - Food and water
  - Various forms of contact

#### Removal of Impurity

- **Permanent impurity**: Cannot be removed
- **Temporary impurity**: Removed through ritual bath, particularly using Ganges water (purificatory agent)

### Food and Vessel Rules

#### Types of Food

- **Kachcha food**: Raw or cooked in water (more likely to transmit impurity)
- **Pakka food**: Cooked in ghee and oil (less likely to transmit impurity, cooking process removes impurity)

#### Vessel Material Impact

- **Copper/Bronze vessels**: Better for receiving food/water from lower caste
- **Earthen pots**: More likely to transmit impurity

### DUMONT's Unity Thesis

**"India is One"** because:

- Caste relations in every region are a manifestation of the pan-India ideology of caste
- **That ideology**: Opposition of pure and impure
- **Universal belief**: All sections of society believe in this principle:
  - Men and women
  - Villagers and city dwellers  
  - Rich and poor
  - People in different regions
  - **Importantly**: Even lower castes subscribe to the notion of opposition of pure and impure

#### Evidence of Universal Acceptance

- **Lower caste behavior**: Even untouchables practice untouchability against castes lower than them in ritual scale
- **Example by ANDRE BETEILLE**: 
  - Brahmin friend threw money on ground for untouchable caste person
  - When BETEILLE tried to hand money directly, the untouchable person ran away
  - **Reason**: He also considered himself as polluting and didn't want to violate BETEILLE's state of purity

### Western vs Indian Society Comparison

| Aspect                       | Western Society                                           | Indian Society                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**                     | Homo Equalis                                              | Homo Hierarchicus                             |
| **Core value**               | Equality                                                  | Hierarchy                                     |
| **Individual vs Collective** | Individualism (individual more important than collective) | Holism (whole more important than individual) |
| **Fundamental belief**       | Fundamental equality of all human beings                  | People born with different values/worth       |

### DUMONT's Defense of Caste System

- **Western criticism**: Western scholars viewed caste as highly exploitative and irrational system
- **DUMONT's counter**: Western scholars viewing Indian system from Western lens based on Western logic
- **His argument**: If caste system evaluated from Indian perspective, it is not irrational or exploitative
- **Reasoning**: 
  - West obsessed with individual rights
  - In Indian values, individual doesn't matter - only part of larger whole
  - Lower castes willingly submit to Brahmanical superiority
  - All castes willingly submit to the authority of Brahmins

### Ideological Principle of Caste

**According to the ideological principle of caste (opposition of pure and impure)**:

- **Truly pan-India**: All sections of society believe in this principle
- **Universal acceptance**: Whether men or women, villagers or city dwellers, rich or poor, people in different regions, high caste or low caste

### The Timeless Truth of Caste

**DUMONT suggests**: More than 2000 years back, Hindu civilization discovered the timeless truth of caste and it still operates till this day

**The timeless truth**: Ritual purity is independent of wealth and power

**Practical application**:

- **King**: May be at top of secular hierarchy possessing immense wealth and power
- **Yet**: He is subordinated to the ritual superiority of the Brahmin
- **Hierarchy independence**: Ritual hierarchy is independent of secular hierarchy
- **Priority**: Ritual status is more important than wealth and power

**Modern evidence**: Even today, people from wealthy backgrounds bow before poor Brahmins due to Brahmins' superior ritual status

## Substantialization of Caste (95:09)

### Change Acknowledged by DUMONT

- **Traditional system**: Characterized by interdependence between castes
  
  - Different castes specialized in different occupations
  - Mutual dependence (e.g., need sunar for gold ornaments, lohar for iron implements, etc.)

- **Modern change**: Due to modernization, traditional interdependence of castes has broken down
  
  - **New pattern**: Castes have emerged as self-sufficient blocks competing with each other
  - **Example**: Baniya depends on fellow baniyas, Jats depend on Jats, etc.
  - **Competition**: Among castes for jobs, educational opportunities, land, panchayat seats

## Discussion and Criticism (120:34)

### Student Observations on Declining Caste Practices

- **Legal deterrent**: Legal prohibition on caste-based discrimination
- **Educational impact**: Modern education reducing caste consciousness
- **Social mixing**: Free interaction irrespective of caste in educational institutions
- **Changing acceptance**: Declining acceptance of Brahmanical superiority
- **Historical challenges**: Caste system has been continuously challenged throughout Indian history

### Criticisms of GHURE and DUMONT

#### Over-reliance on Texts

- **Problem**: Both scholars relied too much on ancient Sanskrit scriptures
- **Issue**: Scripts authored by Brahmins, revealing their preferred societal arrangement
- **Lack of context**: Analysis lacked real-world context of how caste actually operates on ground

#### Ahistorical Approach

- **Definition**: Non-historical, does not factor in historical changes over years
- **Problem**: Using 2000-4000 year old texts to explain current caste system
- **SRINIVAS's criticism**: On ground, caste may operate very differently from scriptures

#### Book View vs Ground Reality

- **SRINIVAS's argument**: In social reality, caste operates quite differently than what is mentioned in scriptures
- **Example by DEEPANKAR GUPTA**: In western UP, Jats mock Brahmins, consider them lazy, say "Brahmin jo paida mein bhi khawat, mare mein bhi dawat" (Brahmins want free food whether birth or death ceremony)

#### Reductionist Approach

- **SRINIVAS's criticism of DUMONT**: Reduces complex caste system to single phenomenon (pure-impure)
- **Counter-argument**: Caste system is far more complex and should not be reduced to one single thing

#### Prescriptive vs Descriptive

- **ANDRE BETEILLE's criticism**: DUMONT outlines what caste ought to be, not what caste is
- **Problem**: Based on books/constitutional documents rather than ground reality

#### Mirroring Brahmanical Views

- **Criticism**: Their writings mirror the Brahmanical view of caste
- **Comparison**: DUMONT criticized as "modern Manu" - Homo Hierarchicus as modern day Manusmriti
- **BERREMAN's view**: DUMONT listened too much to Brahmins, relied too heavily on Brahmanical sources
