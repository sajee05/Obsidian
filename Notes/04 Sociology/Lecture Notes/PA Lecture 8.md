# Practical Problems in Using Scientific Method in Sociological Research

## Brief Recap: Sociology as a Science (23:52)

- We discussed whether sociology is a science or not in which there are two broad viewpoints
- **Positivist position**: Sociology is a scientific discipline no less than any of the other sciences. In fact, COMTE calls it the queen science
- According to positivists in social life also we can identify repetitive patterns and then accordingly we can frame generalizations to predict future outcomes, or we can frame laws like physicists or chemists would do
- **Antipositivist position**: Human beings are fundamentally different from the subject matter of the natural sciences in the sense we have consciousness. So we are thinking entities. We do not mechanically respond to external stimuli but we first attach meaning to it and then respond
- Because of which there is a lot of variability in human behavior. You cannot have any set patterns which it follows
- The scientific method is incapable according to the antipositivists of capturing the meanings and motives and emotions of the social actors

## Practical Problems in Using the Scientific Method in Sociological Research (25:50)

### Problem of Experimentation (33:48)

- **The heart and soul of the scientific method is experimentation**
- You say science and what comes to mind? Experiments and laboratories
- Laboratories are controlled environments where you think of beers and petri dishes and all those things which can be controlled
- In an experiment what do we do? We try to identify the relationship between two variables keeping other things constant

#### Limitations of Experimentation in Sociology

**1. Ethical and Practical Limitations**
- Many sociological concerns or topics which are of interest to sociologists may not be amenable to experimentation simply because of practical limitations
- For example, if you want to conduct research on communal riots. Should you be introducing certain variables to see how Hindus react how Muslims react? No
- Why? Because in physics, chemistry, etc. you are dealing with inanimate objects. But here you are dealing with human beings, human lives, human relationships
- Any experimentation done in sociology might have real world consequences. Your experiment on communal riots might instigate one leading to loss of lives
- Your experiment on marital discord might lead to marital breakdown of a couple or might strain their relationship

**2. Replication Problems**
- A lot of situations which interest us as sociologists, you simply can't replicate them in a lab type setting
- Lab is a finite space limited room building where a lot of the variables are under the control of the researchers
- How do you fit entire communities into labs?

**3. Ethical Dilemmas**
- Should you tell the subjects who are being researched upon that they are being researched upon?
- If you tell them: It's ethical but they will be on their best behavior which might not be their true self
- If you don't tell them: It's unethical to not tell them that you are conducting research on them
- How do you get someone to an interview if you not tell them that you are exactly conducting research?

**4. Privacy Concerns**
- A lot of sociological research takes place on human sexuality. Sexuality is something a lot of people in a lot of cultures would consider a very very private affair
- A lot of for a lot of people their family life is their private affair. So they will not let the researcher enter into their family or peak into their family

**5. Too Many Variables Involved**
- In social life there are far too many variables and it may not be practically possible to hold a good number of them constant while conducting research
- Say you want to identify the relationship between education level and income level
- One's income is affected by so many other variables other than education like caste, family background, parental income, parental education level, ethics, how the economy is doing, and numerous others
- Not only this, the other variables are also interconnected. So a person's educational level is also affected by his caste and his parents income
- There are too many interconnections in the social variables. So it gets very difficult to have a controlled environment where you can hold various other factors constant

#### Alternative: Field Experiments

- If we don't conduct or get an opportunity to conduct lab experiments we conduct what are called as **field experiments**
- Field experiments means things are happening out there. So you don't need to get them in an artificial room or environment. You go and collect data out there
- For example lot of field experiments have been done amongst industrial workers. They would go to the industry and try to change the lighting and see how it affects workers productivity. Change the ventilation and see how it affects workers productivity

### Problem of Measurement and Quantification (58:26)

- **In the natural sciences a lot of progress has been made because these sciences have been able to devise standardized units of measurement for the various phenomena that they study**
- In sociology we have not been able to devise despite the discipline now maturing to almost 200 years of existence. We have unfortunately failed as a discipline to devise any standardized units of measurement for most of the things that we study

#### Examples of Standardized Units in Physics
- **Mass**: kilogram
- **Length**: meters  
- **Time**: seconds
- **Force**: newton
- **Pressure**: pascal

- There is universal consensus amongst ordinary people and amongst the researchers what is 1 meter, 1 second
- This has enabled capturing of the phenomena under study in a mathematical quantifiable manner
- You can add things up, subtract them, multiply them, whatever. That has enabled immense progress in these fields

#### Lack of Standardized Units in Sociology

- **We study religion** - an area of immense interest to sociologists studying secularization or decline of religiosity
- Can you capture it mathematically that religiosity was 10 jewels in 1850 and now it is three jewels? There are no units of religiosity
- **We study social relationships** at a most fundamental level and we don't have any units of measurement for the strength of social relationships

#### How Sociology Attempts Measurement

- **Through surveys**: We develop a scale mathematical type. We may give a scale of 1 to 10. How much do you love your wife?
- Somebody might mark five. Somebody might mark seven. But these are subject to interpretation
- The five wala guy may be loving his wife objectively more than the seven guy but he thinks he only loves her five units
- **Using normal English words in our surveys**: How will you rate your relationship with your brother? Very good. Good. Okay. Bad. Very bad
- One person's bad and the other person's good may be quite similar
- **There is no standardized units of measurement for much of the phenomena that we study and that is a major problem**
- **Scientific research is based upon quantification, mathematization which is very difficult in sociology** ⭐ (The word "sociology" appears to be repeated here - "sociological" would be more appropriate)

### Problem of Generalization (67:29)

- **In the natural sciences whatever laws or generalizations are made hold universally or near universally true**
- Force is equal to mass into acceleration. Irrespective of culture, caste, creed, class, gender, whatever of the researcher or of the people
- H2 plus half O2 gives you H2O everywhere. It's a universal

#### Society-Specific Nature of Sociological Generalizations

- **Any conclusions or generalizations we arrive at in sociological research tend to be very society specific or culture specific**
- People's behavior, their interpretation of things varies from culture to culture
- What may be true for India may not be true for America and vice versa

#### Example: Domestic Violence Research

- **In the US**: They conducted a research and found out that a higher incidence of domestic violence is associated with a higher incidence of family breakdown or marital breakdown
- **In India**: They went with the same premise and found the opposite that India a high incidence of violence is not positively correlated with high rate of family breakdown
- **Why?** Mindsets, cultural expectations, societal norms, people's patterns of socialization etc. vary greatly between India and America

**Comparison Table: Universal Laws vs. Sociological Generalizations**

| Aspect | Natural Sciences | Sociology |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Universality** | Laws hold universally (F=ma, H2+½O2→H2O) | Society and culture specific |
| **Generalization Scope** | Apply everywhere regardless of researcher background | Limited to specific cultural contexts |
| **Variability** | Consistent across all conditions | Varies based on cultural norms, socialization patterns |
| **Example** | Chemical reactions same worldwide | Domestic violence effects differ between US and India |

## Problem of Objectivity (73:32)

### Fact, Value and Objectivity (74:14)

#### Definitions

- **Fact**: An empirically verifiable observation. Facts remain the same for all observers
- **Values**: Refer to the subjective disposition or preferences a person may have due to socialization, personal experiences, societal influence or prejudice
- **Values of a society**: Define what is considered as worthwhile and important by its members
- **Objectivity**: According to ROBERT BIERSTEDT, objectivity means the conclusions arrived at as a result of inquiry are independent of the race, color, creed, occupation, nationality, religion, moral preferences and political predisposition of the researcher

#### Examples of Cultural Values Differences

**Western Society vs Indian Society**

| Aspect | Western Society | Indian Society |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Core Value** | Individualism | Collectivism |
| **Focus** | Individual rights, freedoms, aspirations | Family, larger collectivity |
| **Marriage System** | Love marriage (individual attraction, satisfaction) | Arranged marriage (family status, family considerations) |
| **Priority** | Individual needs | Family honor, family wishes |

- **Western society** is premised upon the value of individualism. The individual is considered as more important than the collectivity or the larger social entity
- **Indian society**: One manifestation or expression of collectivism in India is familism. Family is more important than the individual
- **In India** the likes, desires, aspirations of the individual can be sacrificed for the good of the family. We marry as per family's wishes. We pursue careers as per family's wishes or for family honor

### Different Positions on Objectivity

#### 1. Positivist Position (102:02)

- **According to positivists like COMTE, like DURKHEIM sociological research is also characterized by objectivity**
- **Objectivity means that the researcher adopts a detached, unemotional and clinical attitude towards the subject matter of his research**
- **The researcher doesn't allow his own opinions, prejudices, biases to color the research project**
- **Thus, the research is free of the value preferences of the researcher**

**Methods to Enhance Objectivity:**
- Focus on data or empirical evidence. They should let data or empirical evidence guide their research
- Use of statistical tools in the analysis and verification of the research findings can also enhance objectivity
- Other researchers or other scientists can also go through the data and verify the findings or the process which has been adopted by the researcher
- **Sociological researchers must remain committed to the ethos of science and keep their own biases aside**
- **With the use of technology objectivity can be further enhanced** (algorithms, machinery analyzing data instead of humans)
- **Like DURKHEIM said: Treat social facts as things** - in a very detached, cold, clinical, unemotional way
- **Research should be guided by data. It should be a data-driven research. Let the data itself speak. Researcher should not speak**

#### 2. Non-Positivist Position (118:05)

**Key Scholars**: DEREK PHILLIPS, ALVIN GOULDNER

- **Sociological research is bound to get affected by the values of the researcher at each and every point of the research project**
- **The social background, the value preferences of the researcher are bound to affect the research at its each and every stage**

**Stages Where Values Affect Research:**
- From the selection of the topic of the research
- To what sources of data are relied upon
- How the key terms are defined
- Which data is considered as anomalous or ignored
- To the conclusions which are finally arrived at

**Example: Sociology of Work**
- The discipline of sociology emerged in the context of the French and the industrial revolutions
- From the very start sociology of work was a very important area of sociological research
- **But till about as late as 1960s, the enormous amounts of work done by women inside homes was not even regarded as work**
- **1960s there was a wave of feminism in the US and when women sociologists started writing they highlighted this much neglected dimension of work**
- **Who you are will determine what you focus upon, what you consider worthy of investigation, how you define the key terms**

**Comparison: MARX and DURKHEIM**
- Both were near contemporaries looking at the same modern western society
- **DURKHEIM wrote in very glowing terms about the division of labor** and productivity increase
- **MARX wrote with a lot of condemnation** for grave inequalities and structured exploitation and oppression in society
- Very same society, different perspectives based on who they were

**ALVIN GOULDNER's Position**
- **Book**: *Anti-Minotaur: The Myth of Value-Free Sociology*
- **Facts and values cannot be completely separated from each other**
- The values that you have will affect how you interpret the facts. The same facts can be interpreted and reinterpreted in a variety of ways depending on one's preference, inclination, moral judgment
- **Researchers can't escape their biases and prejudices no matter how hard they try**
- **GOULDNER suggests that it is better for the researcher to be open about his value preferences instead of hiding behind the cloak of objectivity**

#### 3. WEBER's Middle Ground Position (137:40)

- **WEBER is of the view that sociological research can never be entirely unaffected by the values of the researcher. It is impossible to have a completely value-free sociology**

**Value Relevance vs Value Neutrality**

- **Selection of research topic**: According to WEBER, the selection of the topic of research is affected by the values of the researcher
- Out of the innumerable social phenomena, which one the researcher chooses to study is guided by his interest, values and inclination
- What the researcher considers as worthy of research always depends on his perspective
- **The choice of the research problem or the research topic is value relevant**

**Examples from WEBER's own research:**
- WEBER chose to study bureaucracy. Why? His father was a bureaucrat
- He chose to study Protestant religion. Why? His mother was a devout Protestant

**Value Neutrality After Topic Selection:**
- **Once the topic of research has been chosen, subsequent steps the researcher should be very consciously trying that his values do not affect the research**
- **The researcher must remain value neutral - unbiased, impartial**

**How to Achieve Value Neutrality:**
1. **The researcher must be conscious of his own values and biases**
2. **The researcher should disclose his research findings without distorting or omitting any data which contradicts his own views**
3. **The researcher should relentlessly pursue value neutrality even if it can never be fully attained** (like a mirage in desert)

#### 4. Critical Researchers Position (151:43)

**Key Scholars**: LEE HARVEY, PHIL CARPEN ⭐ (This name appears unclear in the transcript)

- **These researchers say we should not be objective while conducting research**
- **We should have value preferences, a value commitment**
- **We should speak up for the disprivileged sections of the society**

**LEE HARVEY's Position:**
- **Sociology should have a clear value commitment to give voice to the oppressed and the voiceless**
- **Sociologists must be committed to reveal oppressive social structures**

**PHIL CARPEN's Position:** ⭐ (Name unclear)
- **Sociology should be committed to changing the world**
- **We must drive social change. We must commit ourselves to the creation of a better society**
- For that we will have to speak up for the disadvantaged, the oppressed, the disempowered, the marginalized sections of the society

**Justification for Bias:**
- **Feminist researchers argue** that mainstream sociology is dominated by the male viewpoint. So it is the woman's voice which needs to be articulated
- **Race sociologists or black sociologists** contend that much of mainstream sociology is dominated by the viewpoints of the whites
- **Dalit sociologists** contend that much of sociology is dominated by the viewpoint of the higher castes
- So we are only correcting that imbalance by speaking up for the disadvantaged

**Summary Table: Positions on Objectivity**

| Position | Key Scholars | Main Argument | Approach to Values |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Positivist** | COMTE, DURKHEIM | Research can and should be objective | Values should be completely eliminated |
| **Non-Positivist** | GOULDNER, PHILLIPS | Research cannot be objective at any stage | Be honest about unavoidable value influence |
| **WEBER's Middle Ground** | MAX WEBER | Topic selection is value-relevant but research process should be value-neutral | Acknowledge values in topic choice, strive for neutrality afterward |
| **Critical Researchers** | LEE HARVEY, PHIL CARPEN | Research should not be objective | Deliberately adopt values favoring disadvantaged groups |
