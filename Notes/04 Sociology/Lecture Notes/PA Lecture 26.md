# Family and Kinship Theories: Functional and Dysfunctional Perspectives

## Symbolic Interactionism Review (27:15)

- **Symbolic Interactionism**: Term coined by **HERBERT BLUMER**
- **Interaction with symbols and meanings**: Humans interact through symbols and attach meanings to their interactions

### Weber's Verstehen vs. Mead's Role Taking

**Key Distinction Between Research Method and Daily Social Process:**

- **WEBER's Verstehen**: 
  
  - Research methodology for sociological research
  - Researcher should put himself in the shoes of the social actor
  - Purpose: To identify the meaning that the actor attaches to his actions
  - Limited to researchers conducting sociological research
  - Researcher interested in understanding the social actor, not seeing how actor views researcher

- **MEAD's Role Taking**:
  
  - Happens on a daily basis in our lives
  - We interact with friends, parents, colleagues, teachers, students
  - Daily basis we take up the role of the other to develop or modify our self-concept
  - Formation of the self in everyday social interaction
  - Every day ourselves are getting modified in interaction situations

**Multiple Selves Question:**

- Person has one self which combines all different expectations of diverse social groups
- The "me" component combines together the expectations of various generalized others
- Can be contradictions therein (family may expect something different from friends)
- We try to reconcile these contradictions in ourselves

## Transition to Social Institutions Study (35:23)

- **Framework for Paper Analysis**: 
  
  - Functional perspective will be positive and appreciative of various social arrangements
  - Marxist perspective will criticize various social arrangements as benefiting the capitalist, the haves
  - **WEBER** will also make appearance occasionally

- **Subsequent Topics**: Politics, religion, family, and economy will be analyzed from functional and Marxist perspectives

## Family as Most Beloved Social Institution (37:28)

### Universal Love for Family

- **Family**: Arguably one of the most loved of all social institutions
- Most appreciated, most loved, most cherished of social institutions across cultures
- Cuts across cultures, not just academic viewpoint but amongst members of the public

**Contrast with Other Institutions:**

- **Politics**: Nothing gives people greater pleasure than criticizing politicians
- **Economy**: Those with money seen as exploiters, **MARX** used explicit expletives for the haves
- **Religion**: Heavily criticized - **Hinduism** by **PHULE**, **AMBEDKAR**, **JYOTIBA PHULE**; **Christianity**, **Islam** under scrutiny

### Why We Love Our Families

**Student Responses on Family Love:**

- Born into it, basic nurturing done by parents, exceptional emotional connect
- First social institution we encounter, seems natural and intuitive
- Blood is thicker than water, provides basic necessities and emotional psychological support
- Families simply put are useful - meet emotional, psychological, financial needs
- Family integral to individual, family values reflected in ourselves
- Family stands by you through thick and thin
- Evolutionary perspective: Natural tendency to propagate one's DNA, survival of the fittest

## Murdoch's Universal Family Theory (46:14)

### Definition of Family

**GP MURDOCH's Definition:**

- **Family**: Social group characterized by common residence, economic cooperation, and reproduction
- Involves adults of both sexes, at least two of whom maintain a socially approved sexual relationship (marriage)
- One or more children of the sexually cohabiting adults

### Murdoch's Cross-Cultural Study

- **Study Scope**: 250 different societies analyzed
- **Range**: Simple primitive backward tribal communities to modern industrial nations
- **Coverage**: Different religions (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jewish societies), across geographies and cultures
- **Conclusion**: Family is a universal social institution - existed in all 250 societies studied

## Four Vital Functions of Family (56:14)

### Murdoch's Four Universal Functions

| Function                  | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sexual Function**       | Family provides mechanism for expression and fulfillment of human sexual need; safely channelizes sexual desires; exclusive sexual access prevents social disruption |
| **Reproductive Function** | Every society requires new members; family provides mechanism for reproduction of new members                                                                        |
| **Educational Function**  | Primary socialization - first learnings from family (potty training, language, gender differences, eating habits, clothing norms)                                    |
| **Economic Function**     | Division of labor within family (traditionally: adult male as primary breadwinner, adult female for childcare and domestic tasks)                                    |

### Family's Efficiency vs. Exclusivity

- **Not Exclusive**: Family doesn't exclusively perform these functions
  
  - Economic function: Also performed by factories, retail shops, corporations
  - Educational function: Schools, colleges, universities, coaching institutions
  - Sexual function: Prostitution, premarital sex occur outside family

- **Highly Efficient**: Family performs these functions very efficiently
  
  - Multi-purpose device for society
  - Does many things and does them very efficiently
  - Society greatly cherishes and relies upon family institution

## Impact of Industrialization on Family Functions (68:00)

### Loss of Functions to Specialized Institutions

**Functions Transferred:**

- **Psychological Support**: Professional psychologists and psychiatrists took over
- **Welfare Function**: State took up welfare functions (unemployment support, elderly care)
- **Recreational Function**: Traditional joint family activities replaced by clubs, parties, playdates

### Parsons' Response: Two Irreducible Functions (73:02)

**TALCOTT PARSONS** argued nuclear family retains two basic and irreducible functions:

| Function                                 | Description                                                                                                   | Requirements                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Socialization of the Young**   | Teaching small children (1-2 years) requires extreme patience, warmth; "A for apple" repeated endlessly       | Atmosphere of love, care, and warmth available only in family              |
| **Stabilization of Adult Personalities** | Most social engagements are transactional, formal, impersonal; only family allows full personality expression | Complete acceptance and love; emotional recharging for transactional roles |

**Key Point**: Both functions require atmosphere of love, care and warmth available only in family realm

## Counter-Examples to Murdoch's Universal Family (83:00)

### Challenges to Family Universality

**Modern Examples:**

- **Childless couples**: Increasing prevalence, reproduction function absent
- **LGBTQIA+ community**: Same-sex couples don't have adults of both sexes
- **Single parent units**: Woman raising children alone without man
- **Adoption**: Reproduction function not performed by biological parents
- **Living together couples**: Socially approved sexual relationship missing

### Specific Counter-Examples

| Group/System                | Challenge to Murdoch's Definition                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Poor Blacks in US**       | 30% of units were female-headed, adult male missing                                                       |
| **Kibbutz System (Israel)** | Children didn't reside with biological parents; raised by whole community; considered children of kibbutz |
| **Same-sex Unions**         | Two adult men or women, missing "both sexes" requirement                                                  |
| **Sex Workers**             | Frequently do not have family unit                                                                        |
| **Celibates**               | Sadhus, monks, saints - no family participation                                                           |

### Defense of Murdoch's Theory

**Why Counter-Examples Don't Disprove Universality:**

- These are deviations from the norm in any society
- Among poor blacks: 70% were conventional families with male present
- Even deviant cases often started with family units
- Saints, sex workers are minuscule fraction of population
- All these people were born in family units
- Even in kibbutz: Strong emotional bond between biological parents and children existed
- Family in some form or other present in every known society

## Dysfunctional Theories of Family (103:47)

### Introduction to Family Criticism

- **Reality Check**: Family life is not a bed of roses, far from perfect
- **Family as Source**: Much anguish, depression, mental illness
- **Alternative Perspective**: Views highlighting various dysfunctions and negative aspects of family life

### Student Experiences of Family Problems

**Academic and Career Pressure:**

- Family pressure preventing pursuit of cricket or preferred careers
- Forced into careers against personal interests
- Academic performance pressure compounded by family expectations

**Control and Judgment:**

- Families too overbearing and controlling
- Very judgmental, not open to new thoughts
- Traditional views imposed without logical reasoning
- Privacy hampered by family interference

**Discrimination and Comparison:**

- Discrimination among family members
- Gender-based differential treatment
- Continuous comparisons with siblings ("Be intelligent like your sister")
- Property and inheritance biases

**Emotional and Physical Safety:**

- Child abuse by so-called loving parents
- Domestic violence increase during family togetherness
- Children made victims of parental aggression and frustration
- Parents may pose threat to safety and wellbeing of children

**Societal Pressure and Conformity:**

- Couples staying together just for society's sake
- Unhappy marriages affecting children
- Family legitimizes patriarchy
- Subservience expected without questioning authority
- Creativity of child killed by family expectations

## Vogel and Bell Study on Schizophrenia (121:44)

### Family Environment and Mental Illness

- **Study Focus**: Children with schizophrenia (mental disorder)
- **Key Finding**: Family environment was responsible for development of serious mental illness in children

### Emotional Scapegoating Process

- **Scapegoating Definition**: Child made emotional scapegoat of unresolved parental conflict
- **Example**: Mother yelling at male child "You're becoming like your father" during marital conflicts
- **Mechanism**: Unresolved parental conflicts thrust onto/projected onto the child

**Functional vs. Dysfunctional Aspects:**

- **Functional for Family Unit**: Stabilizes family unit, allows parents to continue their roles
- **Functional for Society**: Parents can fulfill social roles and obligations
- **Dysfunctional for Child**: May scar child psychologically long after conflict has passed; can result in schizophrenia

## Edmund Leach's Nuclear Family Critique (127:18)

### Overloaded Electrical Circuit Analogy

- **EDMUND LEACH**: Nuclear family like overloaded electrical circuit
- **Pre-modern Joint Families**: If one relationship not working, other relationships provided support and satisfaction
- **Modern Nuclear Family**: Too many expectations from limited number of relationships

### Relationship Overburden in Nuclear Family

**Husband's Multiple Roles:**

- Must be husband, lover, best friend, emotional sounding board, shopping partner
- Every relationship overburdened with expectations that cannot be fulfilled
- When circuit gets overloaded: Results in fuse, short circuit, leading to clashes and conflict

### Barriers to Outside World

**Family Creates Psychological Barriers:**

- Family erects barriers between its members and outside world
- Continuous conditioning creates seeds of mistrust toward society
- Family advice: "Big bad world is out there to get you"
- Results in inability to trust other society members, looking at world as conniving

**Societal Impact:**

- Society based upon mistrust, suspicion, antipathy
- Live in single-person prisons, unable to establish bonds with others
- To reaffirm bonds with humanity, must break free from family-erected barriers

## R.D. Laing's Gangster Family Theory (137:03)

### Family as Gangster Organization

- **R.D. LAING**: Compares family to gangsters in book "The Politics of the Family"
- **Gangster World Dynamics**: Competition, violence, one gangster out to get another, protection seeking

### Nuclear Family Gang Behavior

**Emotional Violence Among Members:**

- Family members commit emotional violence against each other
- Strong nexus between father and son creates vulnerability
- Father commits emotional violence ("nallayak beta," comparisons with other children)
- Mother offers protection to child against father's emotional violence

**Mutual Protection Pattern:**

- **Husband-Wife Conflicts**: Say unimaginable things to hurt each other emotionally
- **Seeking Refuge**: After fights, members seek emotional refuge in other family members
- **Protection Dynamics**: Family members offering each other mutual protection against each other's violence

**From Birth Violence:**

- **LAING's Observation**: From moment of birth, child subjected to forces of violence called love
- **Love as Violence**: Love, particularly family love, is very stifling
- **Sibling Competition**: Intense competition for parental love and attention, especially among same-sex siblings
- **Sadistic Satisfaction**: When sibling scolded, provides "biggest source of innate sadistic satisfaction"

## David Cooper's Death of Family Theory (151:28)

### Family Kills Individual Potential

- **DAVID COOPER**: Book titled "The Death of the Family"
- **Core Argument**: Family greatly amplified and glorified but responsible for much social ills

### Individual Potential vs. Family Control

**Every Child's Potential:**

- Great potential to be artist, revolutionary, mad scientist, visionary
- This potential killed by the family
- Family kills and stifles all creativity and individuality

### Childhood Dreams vs. Family Reality

**Childhood Aspirations**: Astronaut, pilot, cricketer, journalist, gangster ⭐ [Added star because "gangster" as childhood aspiration seems unusual/questionable as typical example]

- **Family Response**: Rational explanations about impracticality
- **Result**: Individual interiorizes the family expectations
- **Outcome**: Child becomes "nothing but a proxy of expectations of Mr. Gupta and Mrs. Gupta"

### Family Role Restrictions

- **Adult Restrictions**: Family restricts adults in narrow categories or roles
- **Role Conformity**: Everything must be in accordance with assigned family role (father-husband)
- **Individual Death**: Interiorization of family results in death/murder of individual

### Cooper's Famous Quote

- **"Bringing up a child is bringing down a person"**
- **Solution**: If individual is to be saved, need the death of the family

**Personal Note**: **COOPER** went through mental and spiritual crisis, during which his family (particularly brother) took very good care of him
