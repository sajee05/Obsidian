# Tribal Society: Definitional Issues and Development

## INTRODUCTION TO TRIBAL SOCIETY (19:11)

- **Tribal Society**: A new topic following the discussion on postcolonialism
- **Technical sociological jargon**: The term "tribe" and "tribal society" are established sociological concepts
- **Intuitive understanding**: Most people have some basic understanding of what tribes are, even without sociological or anthropological inputs

### Student Responses on Tribal Characteristics

- **Sense of belongingness**: Tribes have a great sense of belongingness to themselves and their group
- **Avoidance of outside interference**: They don't want interference from outsiders or government
- **Disconnection from mainstream**: Tribals are somewhat disconnected from mainstream society or wider society
- **Forest dwellers**: They live in kind of inaccessible areas like deep in the jungles
- **Distinctive culture**: They have their own dressing sense, language, food, deities
- **Economic backwardness**: There is some sort of economic backwardness with no surplus being generated, making them an egalitarian society
- **Customary laws**: They have their own customary laws regarding marriage, divorce, parenthood
- **Political autonomy**: They are politically autonomous
- **Nature worship**: They engage in nature worship, ancestor worship, spirit worship
- **Small-sized demographics**: Tribes are typically small-sized demographically
- **Different from caste Hindus**: They are kept out of the caste system and are different from caste Hindus

## DEFINITION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF TRIBES (31:05)

### Basic Definition

- **Adivasis**: Called Adivasis in India, where "Adi" means original or from the beginning, and "Vasi" means inhabitants or residents
- **Original inhabitants**: Tribals or Adivasis are considered as the original inhabitants of the land

### Comprehensive Tribal Characteristics

**A tribe is a small-sized society characterized by:**

1. **Primitive technology and economic backwardness**
   
   - Use pre-agricultural tools and implements
   - Engaged in economic activities like hunting and gathering
   - Collecting minor forest produce
   - **Subsistence economy**: Barely manage to survive with little or no surplus being produced

2. **Egalitarian nature**
   
   - The tribal society is therefore egalitarian due to lack of surplus

3. **Geographical isolation**
   
   - Live in geographically secluded areas such as:
     - Inside the forests
     - On hilltops
     - In caves
     - In deserts

4. **Social organization**
   
   - **Close-knit community**: Based on strong bonds of kinship
   - **Isolation preference**: Prefer to avoid contact with non-tribals and outsiders
   - **Political autonomy**: Maintain their political autonomy

5. **Cultural distinctiveness**
   
   - **Own distinctive culture**: Including costume, food habits, marriage patterns, language and customs
   - **Religious beliefs and practices**: Include nature worship, animal worship, land worship (consider land as sacred), spirit worship, ancestor worship
   - **Distinctive religious beliefs**: Have their own deities and rituals

6. **Physical characteristics**
   
   - **Distinct racial features**: Which mark them apart from the non-tribals

## OFFICIAL DEFINITIONS AND CRITERIA (47:39)

### LOKUR Committee Criteria

According to the LOKUR Committee, the following criteria can be used to identify tribes:

1. **Primitive traits**
2. **Distinctive culture**
3. **Geographical isolation**
4. **Shyness of contact** with others
5. **Backwardness**

**Additional criteria:**

- Those still living in caves
- Very isolated groups
- Having tribal characteristics ‚≠ê (This appears to be a circular definition)

### LUCY MAIR's Definition

- **An independent political division of a population with a common culture**
- Emphasis on **political autonomy**

### Imperial Gazetteer of India (1911)

**A tribe is a collection of families:**

- Bearing a common name
- Speaking a common dialect
- Occupying a common territory
- **Not usually endogamous**, though originally it might have been so

### Indian Language Terms for Tribes

- **Adivasi**: Original inhabitants
- **Vanvasi**: Forest dwellers (Van = forest, Vasi = residents)
- **Giri Jan**: Hill dwellers or hill people (Giri = hill)
- **Janati**: Scheduled tribes
- **Primitive group**

| Definition Source       | Key Emphasis                  | Characteristics                                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LOKUR Committee         | Administrative identification | Primitive traits, geographical isolation, shyness of contact |
| LUCY MAIR               | Political autonomy            | Independent political division with common culture           |
| Imperial Gazetteer 1911 | Social organization           | Collection of families with common identity, not endogamous  |

## CRITIQUE OF STEREOTYPICAL DEFINITIONS (55:59)

### Problems with Traditional Definitions

- **Very stereotypical image**: The picture of tribes painted is developed primarily by European anthropology
- **Colonial influence**: This stereotypical definition was developed by colonial administrators and European anthropologists
- **Far from correct portrayal**: This picture is far from a correct portrayal of tribes in India

### Reality of Indian Tribal Diversity

**Statistical facts:**

- **7.5% to 8.6%** of India's population is tribal (as per 2011 census)
- **More than 10 crore people** in the country are tribal
- **More than 700 tribal groups** in India

**Diversity in tribal populations:**

- **Large-sized tribes**: Some tribes number more than a crore (like European countries' population)
- **Small-sized tribes**: 
  - SENTINEL with 15 members
  - ON JGENG with 101 members
  - CHAMPEN with 229 members
  - JARAWA with 380 members

### Contradictions to Stereotypical Image

1. **Not all egalitarian**: Several tribes have developed elaborate and complex stratification systems
2. **Occupational diversity**: Tribal population engaged in variety of economic activities from hunting-gathering to civil servants, even President of India
3. **Geographical diversity**: Many tribals have moved into villages and cities, working in various occupations
4. **Educational advancement**: Many tribes have benefited from modern education and are fairly advanced and integrated into mainstream
5. **Racial diversity**: Tribals come from various racial backgrounds - Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Protoloid, Mongoloid, Negroid

## OUTCOME OF COLONIAL ENCOUNTER (59:03)

### Critical Assessment

**The above definition is an outcome of the colonial encounter and European anthropology and fails to capture:**

- The **diversity**
- **Dynamism** 
- **Complexity** of tribal societies in India

**Key statistics (2011 census):**

- **8.6%** of India's population are scheduled tribes
- **10 crore plus people**
- **705 scheduled tribes**

## GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF TRIBAL POPULATION (69:15)

### Regional Distribution According to VIRGINIUS XAXA Committee

**India's tribal population can be divided into five broad regions:**

1. **Himalayan region (Northeast)**: 14.4% of India's tribal population
2. **Central region** (MP, Chhattisgarh): **52.5%** (bulk of tribal population)
3. **Western region** (Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa): **27.6%**
4. **Southern region** (Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala): **5.3%**
5. **Island region** (Andaman Nicobar, Lakshadweep): **0.1%**

**Percentage-wise concentration:**

- **Lakshadweep**: Highest percentage of tribal population
- **Northeastern states**: Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh (85-90% plus of state population are tribals)

| Region                | States                               | Percentage of India's Tribal Population |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Himalayan (Northeast) | Northeast states                     | 14.4%                                   |
| Central               | MP, Chhattisgarh                     | 52.5%                                   |
| Western               | Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa | 27.6%                                   |
| Southern              | Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala        | 5.3%                                    |
| Islands               | Andaman Nicobar, Lakshadweep         | 0.1%                                    |

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRIBES AND CASTE SOCIETY (74:51)

### Historical Connection

- **Foundational irony**: The founders of caste Hindu society were Aryans, who were themselves an invading tribe
- **Close civilizational link**: There has been a very close and intimate civilizational link between caste society and tribal people for thousands of years

### Examples from Indian Mythology

**NEELAKANTHAN RANJANA's observation:**

- **JANU-JATI interaction**: Has been a recurrent feature of social life in India throughout its civilizational history

**Mythological examples:**

- **ARJUNA's marriage**: To CHITRANGADA, a Naga princess
- **BHIMA's marriage**: To HIDIMBA, tribal princesses married to caste Hindus
- **Vanaras in Ramayana**: Were possibly forest dwelling tribes of central India with proto-Australoid features, depicted as monkeys

### Comparison: Tribes vs Caste Society

| Aspect           | Caste Society            | Tribal Society                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Social Structure | Hierarchically arranged  | Egalitarian                                |
| Residence        | Plains, cities, villages | Secluded areas, forests, deserts, hilltops |
| Technology       | More advanced            | Primitive and backward                     |
| Women's Position | Not equal                | Almost equal/relatively better             |
| Religious Basis  | Hinduism                 | Non-Hindu, non-Muslim                      |
| Language Terms   | Jati                     | Janu                                       |

## HINDU METHOD OF TRIBAL ABSORPTION (79:23)

### N.K. BOSE's Theory

**The Hindu method of tribal absorption:**

- **Caste system expansion**: Cast system has absorbed tribes within its fold
- **Tribal integration**: Various tribes have become castes over thousands of years

**Economic reasons for tribal absorption:**

- **Robust caste economy**: The caste economy was more robust than tribal economy
- **Jajmani system advantage**: Every caste enjoyed monopoly over its occupation with assured clientele
- **Stability attraction**: The stability and robustness of caste economy attracted tribes
- **Price of integration**: Tribes were typically accommodated in the lower rungs (Sudra) of caste hierarchy

## TRIBE-CASTE CONTINUUM (82:46)

### Scholarly Perspective

**Scholars like SURAJIT SAHA and F.G. BAILEY:**

- **Continuum concept**: Used the concept of tribe-caste continuum
- **Not divergent systems**: Tribes and castes are not two completely divergent or opposite social groupings

### Understanding the Continuum

**Different social groups in India may possess features of both castes and tribes in greater or lesser degree:**

**Examples of overlapping features:**

- **Pastoralism**: Found in both pastoralist castes and tribes
- **Ritual pollution**: Many tribes also believe in ritual pollution like castes
- **Endogamy**: Many tribes are also endogamous like castes

**The continuum means:**

- Some social groups are pure caste type
- Some are pure tribe type  
- Many lie somewhere on the continuum with mixed features

## TRIBAL RELIGION AND HINDUISM (88:35)

### Similarities Between Tribal and Hindu Religion

**Common religious practices:**

- **Nature worship**: Both Hindus and tribals personify, consider sacred and worship nature
- **Animal worship**: Hindu deities have animal features (Peacock, Lotus, Snake, Bull, Mouse)
- **Ancestor worship**: Present in both traditions

### Hindu Deities with Tribal Features

**Examples:**

- **GANESHA**: Half elephant, half pot-bellied man riding on mouse
- **SHIVA**: With matted hair, animal skin, blue color - looks more tribal than caste Hindu
- **Various animal vehicles**: Hindu deities have tribal-type features

### Scholarly Perspectives on Tribal-Hindu Relationship

**GHURYE's view:**

- **"Backward Hindus"**: Tribals are "backward Hindus" in quotation marks
- **Imperfect integration**: They are imperfectly integrated sections of Hindu samaj, not separate from Hindus

**DEVDUTT PATTANAIK's observation:**

- **Central role of forests**: Forests have played a very central role in Hinduism
- **Epic connections**: Both Ramayana and Mahabharata - Rama was a forest dweller (vanvasi), Pandavas lived in forests during exile

**ANDRE BETEILLE's view:**

- **Integral to Hindu culture**: Forests have been very integral to Hindu culture
- **Sadhu tradition**: Hindu sadhus go to forests for meditation and enlightenment
- **Guru ashrams**: Often located in forests
- **Four-fold life scheme**: Hindus are expected to go to forests for vanaprastha

### Integration of Tribal Deities

**DEVDUTT PATTANAIK notes:**

- **Thousands of gods and goddesses**: Various tribal deities have been incorporated into Hindu pantheon
- **Local tribal goddesses**: Various local hill tribal goddesses have been brought into the Hindu fold

**Examples of Hindu gods with tribal origins:**

- **Lord JAGANNATH**
- **AYYAPPA**
- **MURUGAN**
- **VITTAL**
- **BALAJI**
- **VITOBA**
- **KANDOBA**
- **Various manifestations of the mother goddess**

### Statistical Evidence

**NADIM HASNAIN's research:**

- **95% of India's tribal population** is at varying degrees of Hinduization

### Sanskritization Among Tribes

**Examples:**

- **BHUMIJ of West Bengal**: Wear sacred thread, go on pilgrimages to sacred Hindu sites, claim to be Brahmins

### Tribe-Rajput Continuum

**SURAJIT SAHA's concept:**

- **Tribal rulers claiming Kshatriya status**: Frequently tribal rulers have claimed Kshatriya status and modeled their lifestyle on Rajputs
- **Example**: BHUMIJ tribe claimed to be Rajputs and had BHUMIJ RAJ in Birbhum

## CONCLUSION ON TRIBAL IDENTITY (104:59)

### Administrative vs Cultural Reality

**Key points:**

- **Administrative necessity**: The Indian state has an administrative necessity to distinguish between tribals and non-tribals
- **Artificial distinction**: ANDRE BETEILLE suggests the distinction is artificial
- **Legal-administrative category**: A tribe is more of a legal-administrative category developed by the Indian state

### Religious Diversity Among Tribes

**Examples:**

- **Muslim tribes**: Lakshadweep population, several tribes in Jammu Kashmir have adopted Islam
- **Christian tribes**: Many tribes in central and northeast India have adopted Christianity
- **Buddhist tribes**: Like BHUTIA
- **Mixed religious adoption**: Within same tribe, some may be Christianized, some Hinduized

### Constitutional Definition

**Legal position:**

- **Presidential prerogative**: That which the President of India declares to be a tribe and lists in the ST list is a tribe
- **Administrative decision**: Basically a legal-administrative category rather than sociocultural or anthropological distinction

### Final Assessment

**Tribals and non-tribals cannot be considered as mutually exclusive and separate social categories.**

**Key conclusions:**

1. **Eurocentric definition is limiting** and doesn't do full justice to the complexity, diversity and dynamism evident amongst Indian tribes
2. **Large segment Hinduized**: A very large segment of India's tribal population is Hinduized
3. **Historical integration**: Many tribes have historically been part of the jajmani system
4. **Close social relations**: Several others have close social relations (including matrimonial and kinship ties) with caste Hindus
5. **Significant overlap**: There is significant degree of overlap of features between tribals and non-tribals
6. **Not anthropologically feasible**: To neatly classify most social groups as either purely caste or purely tribe type
7. **Artificial distinction**: The distinction between tribals and non-tribals in India is artificial according to ANDRE BETEILLE

## TRIBAL DEVELOPMENT (130:20)

### Colonial Impact on Tribal Life

**Why focus on tribal development after independence?**

- **Autonomous existence crushed**: The autonomous or independent existence of tribals was crushed during the colonial period
- **Significant changes**: There were significant changes in conditions of tribals during colonial period

### British Exploitation Strategy

**Objective of British rule:**

- **Economic exploitation**: Express purpose was economic exploitation of the country and its resources
- **Resource-rich tribal areas**: Areas where tribals lived were resource-rich regions (forests rich in mineral wealth, timber)

### Colonial Legislative Measures

**Timeline of colonial policies:**

| Year | Policy/Act                                          | Impact                                                                      |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1864 | Imperial Forest Department established              | Beginning of systematic forest control                                      |
| 1867 | Imperial Forest Service created                     | Administration and management of forest resources                           |
| 1894 | First detailed forest policy                        | Restricted free movement in forests, tribals lost control over forest lands |
| 1935 | Government of India Act (based on Simon Commission) | Continued British policy of segregation of tribes                           |

### British Segregation Policy

**Excluded areas classification:**

- **Totally or partially excluded areas**: Tribal areas declared as such
- **Restricted contact**: Contact between non-tribals and tribals was restricted
- **Administrative control**: Only with British government permission could non-tribals enter
- **Governor's authority**: Administration vested with governor reporting to federal government

**Purpose of segregation:**

1. **Prevent unity**: Prevent India from becoming one nation
2. **Weaken national sentiment**: Engender sense of distinctiveness and separation
3. **Anti-colonial struggle**: Socio-political climate dominated by anti-colonial struggle
4. **Resource extraction**: Useful for extraction of resources without tribal resistance

### Impact of Colonial Policies

**The colonial state through successive policy and legislative measures:**

- **Divested tribals**: Of traditional rights over forest lands and resources
- **Destroyed economy**: And political autonomy
- **Destroyed organic linkages**: Between tribals and non-tribals
- **Introduced outsiders**: Caste Hindus, traders, merchants, contractors, money lenders in tribal areas
- **Permitted missionary activities**: Christian missionaries allowed
- **Declared reserve forests**: Several areas declared as reserve forests
- **Discouraged shifting cultivation**: Considered unscientific and wasteful

### VERRIER ELWIN's Observation

**"Our forest laws are such that every forest dweller breaks at least one law every day of his life."**

This highlights the extent of over-regulation where traditional tribal lifestyle became illegal under colonial laws.

### Tribal Revolts and Uprisings (149:01)

**Major tribal revolts during colonial period:**

| Tribe   | Year  | Region        |
| ------- | ----- | ------------- |
| BHILS   | 1818  | -             |
| KOLS    | 1832  | -             |
| BHUMIJ  | 1833  | Bengal        |
| MIZOS   | 1860s | Northeast     |
| SANTHAL | 1855  | -             |
| MUNDA   | 1899  | Central India |
| GONDS   | 1941  | Central India |

### Analysis of Tribal Revolts

**Common characteristics:**

1. **Mostly localized**: In both time and space
2. **Expression of resentment**: Against policies of colonial state  
3. **Ethnic unity**: Uniting factor was ethnic identity and culture
4. **Charismatic leadership**: Led by charismatic leaders (SIDHU and KANU MURMU in Santhal rebellion, RANI GAIDINLIU in Naga areas, BIRSA MUNDA in Munda rebellion)
5. **Ruthless suppression**: Most were ruthlessly crushed by colonial state using military might

### Outcome and Legacy

**Impact on post-independence policy:**

- **Highlighted tribal problems**: These uprisings sufficiently highlighted the problems of Indian tribes
- **Top agenda item**: Issue of tribal development was on top of agenda of national leadership after independence
- **Aware leadership**: National leadership was acutely aware of concerns and sought to address them through policy measures
