# Caste System: Class vs Caste Comparison and Mobility

## DEFINITION AND FEATURES OF CASTE SYSTEM (15:12)

### Scholarly Definition of Caste

- **CASTE according to ANDRE BETH**: A small and named group which is characterized by endogamy, particular occupation, hereditary membership and a specific style of life associated with a traditional occupation and ritual status in a hierarchical system

### Main Features of the Caste System

1. **Ascribed status** - determined at birth, fixed and unchangeable
2. **Endogamy** - marriage within one's own caste group
3. **Hierarchy** - ranked arrangement of different caste groups
4. **Caste panchayats** - traditional governing bodies
5. **Occupational specification** - specific traditional occupations linked to caste
6. **Rigidity** - strict social boundaries and rules

## JAJMANI SYSTEM (18:50)

### Definition and Characteristics

- **JAJMANI SYSTEM**: A system of exchange between the jajman (recipients of service or patrons) and the kamins (service providers)
- Not simply a barter type exchange but involves:
  - Exchange of goods and services with grains
  - Intergenerational relationships between families
  - Forms the backbone of rural economy and traditional social order

### Nature of Jajmani Relations

- **Reciprocal obligations**: Both kamins and jajmans have obligations towards each other
- **Ritualistic economic bond**: Service providers receive grains and other compensation in return
- **System based on**: Cooperation, interdependence, and reciprocity
- **MARXIST perspective**: Views it as an exploitative and oppressive system

## CASTE VS VARNA DISTINCTION (22:00)

### Key Differences

- **VARNA**: Pan-India framework with four categories (Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Sudra)
- **CASTE**: Thousands of specific occupational categories within the varna framework
- **Function**: Varna framework helps people in different regions place each other in the hierarchy
- **Practical application**: Castes are the real functional units, while varna provides the broader classification

### Special Notes

- **Adopted child's caste**: Considered to have the social identity of adoptive parents, not biological parents
- **GOTRA**: An exogamous clan where marriage is prohibited due to assumed descent from fictitious ancestor

## COMPARISON BETWEEN CASTE AND CLASS SYSTEMS (25:00)

### Similarities

- Both are systems of hierarchy and inequality
- Both have different social groups placed in hierarchical arrangement
- Both involve concepts of upper, middle, and lower strata

### Fundamental Differences

| Aspect                  | Caste System                             | Class System                             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Basis of Hierarchy**  | Ritual purity and pollution              | Wealth and economic status               |
| **Status Type**         | Ascribed (determined at birth)           | Achieved (can be changed through effort) |
| **Social Mobility**     | Prohibited/severely restricted           | Allowed and encouraged                   |
| **Society Type**        | Closed society                           | Open society                             |
| **Geographic Presence** | Primarily Indian phenomenon              | Universal (present in every society)     |
| **Religious Basis**     | Based on religious scriptures (Hinduism) | No religious basis or origins            |
| **Marriage Rules**      | Endogamy prescribed                      | No such restrictions                     |
| **Self-identification** | Clear and undisputed                     | May be unclear or incorrect              |

### Nature of Social Interaction

- **Class Society**: No restrictions on social intercourse across class boundaries
- **Caste Society**: Very severe restrictions and punishments for violation of social boundaries

### Identification and Clarity

- **Caste identification**: Always clear - individuals know their caste precisely
- **Class identification**: Often unclear - people may incorrectly identify their class position (e.g., rich people thinking they are middle class)

## MOBILITY IN CASTE SYSTEM: CHALLENGING THE "CLOSED SOCIETY" NOTION (41:00)

### Important Clarification

- **Reality**: No society is fully open or fully closed
- Even modern industrial societies have barriers based on birth (race, gender, parental income)
- **PEW RESEARCH study "Pursuing the American Dream"**: Showed mobility in USA is affected by race and parental income
- **Caste society**: Not fully closed - mobility is possible through various means

### Ways of Mobility in Caste System

#### 1. Acquisition of Political Power

- **Historical pattern**: Numerous castes have captured thrones and become kings over the ages
- **Process**: When non-Kshatriya castes acquire political power, they claim Kshatriya status
- **K.M. PANIKKAR's observation**: After NANDAS in 5th century BC, numerous ruling dynasties have come from non-Kshatriya backgrounds

**Examples of Non-Kshatriya Rulers:**

- CHANDRAGUPTA MAURYA (lower caste origin)
- NANDA dynasty (lower caste origin according to sources)
- GUPTA dynasty
- PAL dynasty of Bengal  
- MARATHAS of Maharashtra
- JAT rulers of Bharatpur

#### 2. Patronage and Royal Favor

- **Method**: Coming into good books of ruling class and gaining their patronage
- **Classic Example - KAYASTHA caste**:
  - Originally scribes and accountants with SUDRA origins
  - Served various rulers as court officials, record keepers
  - Through proximity to ruling classes, graduated from non-dwija to dwija status
  - **DWIJA status**: Twice-born (Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya) - allowed sacred thread ceremony
  - Different KAYASTHAS in different regions now claim different varna status (some Kshatriya, some Brahmin)

#### 3. Renunciation

- **Process**: Giving up worldly belongings, attachments, and connections
- **Result**: Considered above and beyond the pale of caste
- **Examples**: Religious figures, saints who transcend caste boundaries through spiritual renunciation

#### 4. Religious Conversion

- **Historical movements**: Lower caste backgrounds have challenged caste system through:
  - Birth of Sikhism
  - Bhakti movement and saints
  - Conversion to Islam
  - **AMBEDKAR's conversion**: To Buddhism (Navyana Buddhism) as escape from Hindu caste system

## SANSKRITIZATION (61:45)

### Definition by M.N. SRINIVAS

**SANSKRITIZATION**: The process by which a lower caste or tribe takes up, imitates the rituals, customs, beliefs, language and lifestyle of Brahmans or other higher castes (frequently dwija varnas) in order to improve their ritual rank.

### Examples of Sanskritizing Practices

#### Cultural Adoption

- **Food habits**: Adopting vegetarianism, giving up alcohol consumption
- **Dress and appearance**: Wearing dhoti, sporting tilak, chewing betel nut
- **Religious practices**: Performing sacred thread ceremony, going for pilgrimage to distant holy places
- **Language**: Using Sanskritic concepts and words (dharma, karma, moksha, maya, papa, punya, moksha)

#### Social Structure Changes

- **Patriarchal practices**: Withdrawing women from working outside home
- **Dowry practices**: Starting to practice dowry
- **Family structure**: Developing patriarchal joint family system

### Historical Context

- **Initial terminology**: SRINIVAS first used "Brahmanization" but later changed to "Sanskritization"
- **Reason for change**: Realized it's not only Brahmans being imitated, but any higher castes
- **Purpose**: To improve ritual rank in local hierarchy

### Contemporary Relevance

- **Ongoing phenomenon**: Takes place historically and contemporarily
- **Modern adaptations**: Display of Hindu identity, religious symbols
- **Rural vs Urban**: More visible in rural areas compared to urban settings where westernization dominates

## COLONIAL PERIOD MOBILITY: CENSUS OPERATIONS (79:00)

### British Census and Caste Hierarchy

- **New avenue**: Census operations during British rule created opportunities for mobility
- **Process**: British censuses noted and ranked castes, creating official hierarchy
- **Community response**: Various communities started petitioning British government claiming higher caste status

### Methods Used by Communities

- **Genealogy fabrication**: Communities started faking genealogies
- **Divine descent claims**: Claiming descent from deities or ancient rulers
- **Examples**: YADAVS claimed descent from Lord Krishna

### Outcomes

- **Mostly rejected**: Most such claims were rejected by colonial authorities
- **Official endorsement**: When accepted, it provided official stamp of higher status
- **Impact**: Created precedent for status mobility through official recognition

## NATURE OF MOBILITY: CASTE VS CLASS COMPARISON (85:00)

### Fundamental Differences in Mobility

| Aspect                   | Caste System                           | Class System                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Theoretical Position** | Prohibits mobility                     | Actively encourages mobility       |
| **Rate of Mobility**     | Significantly lower                    | Higher rate                        |
| **Unit of Mobility**     | Whole community                        | Individual and family              |
| **Approval Required**    | Depends on acceptance by higher castes | Independent of others' approval    |
| **Speed/Pace**           | Much slower, takes generations         | Faster, can happen within lifetime |
| **Consequences**         | Varied and complex                     | Primarily material improvement     |

### Consequences of Mobility in Caste System

#### Positive Outcomes

- Improvement in ritual rank
- Better social status

#### Negative Outcomes

- **Intercast conflicts**: Lower castes claiming higher status may face resistance
- **Increased atrocities**: Examples like Dalit grooms being beaten for riding horses during marriage processions
- **Community divisions**: Internal disagreements about whether to challenge existing hierarchy
- **Marriage complications**: Divisions affect finding marriageable partners within community

### Dependency on Recognition

- **Caste mobility**: Hinges upon claims being accepted by higher castes
- **Indicators**: Acceptance of water, recognition of ritual practices
- **Class mobility**: Independent verification through material possessions and purchasing power

## ORIGINS OF CASTE SYSTEM THEORIES (112:50)

### 1. Divine Theory

- **Basis**: Caste has divine origins as product of varna system
- **Source**: RIGVEDIC hymn - PURUSHA SUKTA hymn in RIGVEDA
- **Content**: Brahmans from mouth, Kshatriyas from arms, Vaishyas from thighs, Sudras from feet
- **Scriptural sanction**: Legitimized in various scriptures, most notably MANUSMRITI

### 2. Karma Theory

- **Principle**: One's deeds in previous lives determine caste status in present life
- **Logic**: Low caste status due to past bad karma, high caste due to past good deeds
- **Nature**: Religious/theological justification of caste system

### 3. Occupational Theory (NESFIELD)

- **Origin**: Caste emerged from occupational guilds
- **Process**: 
  - People pursuing same occupation formed guilds
  - Developed closure to preserve occupational monopoly
  - Started marrying within same occupational group
  - Prohibited entry of outsiders to protect trade secrets and reduce competition
- **Result**: Guilds developed caste features like closure and endogamy

## RACIAL THEORY OF CASTE ORIGINS (120:20)

### HERBERT RISLEY's Theory

**Core Argument**: Caste system has racial origins based on distinction between invading ARYANS and local inhabitants

#### Historical Process According to RISLEY

1. **Aryan Invasion**: Fair-skinned, long-nosed ARYAN race entered India
2. **Conquest**: They conquered dark-skinned pre-Aryan local inhabitants known as DASUS  
3. **Racial Preservation**: To prevent racial intermixing, ARYANS prohibited sexual or marital relations between fair-skinned conquerors and dark-skinned conquered population
4. **Gender-specific Rules**: 
   - Mostly male ARYAN marauders imposed endogamy
   - Accepted hypergamy (Aryan men with local women)
   - Strictly prohibited hypogamy (local men with Aryan women)
5. **Caste Emergence**: Clear distinction between conquerors and conquered led to caste system with endogamy as central feature
6. **Purpose**: To prevent miscegenation and preserve racial purity

#### RISLEY's Famous Quote

**"The social position of a caste varies inversely with its nasal index"**

- **Nasal index**: Anthropometric measure - ratio of nose width to height
- **Meaning**: Higher castes have fine (longer, slimmer) noses; lower castes have broad noses
- **Method**: RISLEY actually measured physical features of different castes

### Evidence Supporting Racial Theory

#### 1. Linguistic Evidence

- **Word VARNA**: Means "color" (e.g., SHYAM meaning dark-skinned referring to Krishna)
- **Interpretation**: Indicates caste system has racial origins linked to color differences

#### 2. Vedic Literature Evidence

- **Authors**: ARYANS authored VEDIC literature
- **Content**: Disparaging references to non-Aryans in RIGVEDA
- **Examples**: Non-Aryans referred to as "noseless," "bull-lipped"
- **Implication**: Shows racial consciousness and discrimination

#### 3. Contemporary Dalit Activism

- **2001 World Conference Against Racism** (Durban, South Africa)
- **NATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR DALIT HUMAN RIGHTS**: Argued that caste-based discrimination is form of racism
- **Strategy**: Equate caste with race to gain international attention
- **Reasoning**: International community familiar with race/racism but not caste

#### Arguments for Caste-Race Equivalence

- Both are birth-based
- Both transmitted intergenerationally  
- Both involve stigmatization of certain communities
- Both create systematic discrimination

### Criticism of Racial Theory

#### Government of India's Response

- **Official position**: Vehemently denied caste discrimination is racism
- **Reason**: Wanted to avoid international interference in internal matter
- **Support**: Put forward scholars to counter these claims

#### DEEPANKAR GUPTA's Criticisms

1. **Limited Vedic Evidence**: Only single reference in entire RIGVEDA suggests such terminology
2. **Non-disparaging Interpretation**: References may not be insulting - bull signifies patience and strength in Indian culture, not derogatory
3. **Systemic Differences**: Important differences between racial and caste systems

**Key Differences Identified by GUPTA:**

| Aspect                       | Racial System                                        | Caste System                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Intermixing outcomes**     | Child lies between parents on racial scale           | Child of high caste woman and low caste man falls further down hierarchy |
| **Purity-pollution concept** | No concept of ritual purity/pollution                | Central concept of purity and pollution                                  |
| **Employment patterns**      | White households employed black cooks and wet nurses | Brahman would never employ Dalit cook                                    |
| **Physical contact**         | Racial mixing in intimate services acceptable        | Complete prohibition of such contact                                     |

#### ANDRE BETH's Opposition

**Quote**: "To equate caste with race is politically mischievous and scientifically nonsensical"

- **Politically mischievous**: Attempt to internationalize essentially Indian issue for garnering global attention
- **Scientifically nonsensical**: Anthropometric data shows racial differences more across regions than across castes within same region

#### AMBEDKAR's Position

- Also rejected racial theory of caste origins
- Believed anthropometric data does not support racial theory
- Despite acknowledging caste discrimination, didn't accept racial explanation
