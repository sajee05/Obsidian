# Social Stratification and Mobility: Race, Ethnicity, and Social Mobility

## RACE AS A FORM OF STRATIFICATION (CONTINUED) (15:37)

- The previous lecture ended with racism and race as a form of stratification
- **Key scholars to remember**: DUBOIS must be mentioned when writing about race (similar to mentioning AMBEDKAR for untouchability)
- **DUBOIS's contributions**:
  - His efforts with NAACP
  - His views that racism is not just at individual level but institutional level
- **Contemporary scholars on racism**:
  - **JOHN EGAN**: Written extensively on contemporary racism  
  - **ALI RATTANSI**: Discusses new racism vs old racism

### Definition of Race

- **Race**: Division and classification of human population on the basis of phenotypical and biological factors/attributes
- Examples: skin color, physical features
- These divisions are based on physical attributes and biological factors

### DUBOIS's Perspective on Racism

- **DUBOIS argued**: Racism in the US was institutionalized instead of being just at the level of the individual
- It was not merely individual-level prejudice but systematic institutional discrimination

### JOHN EGAN's Analysis

- **EGAN's view**: It is a total race society
- Racism is endemic and present everywhere in modern America
- Found in housing, employment, education, offices, humor - everywhere

## THE DECLINE OF RACE AS A CONCEPT (19:32)

### Historical Context

- The concept of race was relied upon by the West for a long time
- It was put to extensive use to justify:
  - Colonialism
  - Apartheid
  - Various forms of discrimination

### The Turning Point: Nazi Germany

- The concept of race lost legitimacy after its application by **HITLER** and the Nazi German regime
- **Nazi ideology**: 
  - Talked about the superiority of the Germanic race
  - Considered Jews to be an inferior, polluting race
  - Likened Jews to rats and infestations that needed to be done away with
- **Consequence**: The Holocaust - systematic attempt toward extermination of Jews in Germany
- After HITLER's abuse of this concept, the concept of race was somewhat abandoned and fell into disuse

### UNESCO's Response

#### The Race Question (1950)

- **UNESCO** came out with a statement titled "The Race Question"
- Originally published in 1950 with subsequent revisions
- **Signatories**: Several leading scientists, anthropologists, educationists, social scientists, and public leaders worldwide

#### Key Arguments of UNESCO Document

- **Criticized**: The use of the concept of race and condemned the practice of racism
- **Main argument**: According to UNESCO document titled "The Race Question":
  - There are no significant differences between people with different physical attributes in terms of their intelligence and capabilities
  - People who look different (e.g., blacks vs whites) do not necessarily differ in intelligence or capabilities

#### UNESCO's Emphasis on Human Dignity

- **Core principle**: All human beings, irrespective of their physical attributes, are equally deserving of human dignity
- **Rejection of sub-human treatment**: You cannot treat certain races as sub-human or less than human
- **Historical context**: There was a tendency among whites to treat blacks as property and justify them being made into property because they were considered animal-like, uncivilized, and unevolved

## SHIFT FROM RACE TO ETHNICITY (26:40)

### The Transition

- When the argument was accepted that differences between populations are not biological or natural but socio-cultural, there was a shift toward the concept of **ethnicity**
- **Key point**: Differences between people are primarily socio-cultural rather than biological

### What is Ethnicity?

- **Ethnicity/Ethnic Group**: A group of people who identify with each other due to a shared culture
- **Shared elements include**:
  - Shared language
  - Shared religion  
  - Shared food habits
  - Shared tribal identity
  - Shared customs
  - Shared sense of history
  - Common ancestry (assumed blood ties between members)

#### Examples of Ethnic Groups in India

- **Language-based**: Tamils, Bengalis, Punjabis (based on linguistic identity)
- **Religion-based**: Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs
- **Tribal identity**: Santhals, Bodos
- **Regional conflicts**: In Manipur - ethnic clashes between Kukis, Meiteis, and Nagas

#### Historical Example: Martial Races in Colonial India

- **British classification**: Certain social groups were considered "martial races"
- **Examples**: Jats, Sikhs, Gurkhas, Rajputs, Marathas
- **Concept**: As if they were made by nature with a propensity for aggression, fighting, and warfare
- **Reality**: These were actually different ethnic groups, not races

## TWO APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING ETHNICITY (34:03)

### 1. Primordialist Approach

#### Associated Scholar

- **CLIFFORD GEERTZ**: Put forth the primordialist approach

#### Core Concept

- **Primordial**: Means very old, ancient
- **Key argument**: People have a tendency to have a very strong sense of attachment to those with whom they share ties of blood
- **Natural attachment**: People have a primordial attachment - an ancient kind of attachment to those with whom they share ties of blood

#### Explanation of Blood Ties

- **Kinship importance**: Blood relationships are very deep. "Blood is blood, not water"
- People have a very strong sense of attachment to their kin (relatives)
- **Element of self-preservation**: In old times, people used to rely on blood ties for group survival
- People moved about in hordes and tribes whose members were linked through blood ties and kinship

#### Ethnic Groups as Extended Kin Groups

- **GEERTZ's view**: Ethnic groups are seen as extended kin groups
- This is a very primordial kind of human attachment and desire
- **Natural tendency**: Like attracts like
- Examples:
  - As a Baniya, one will have stronger attachment to Baniyas than to other ethnic identities
  - As a Hindi speaker, one will have stronger connection with fellow Hindi speakers than Tamil speakers

#### Human Universal

- **Not individual characteristic**: It's not that only some people are narrow-minded
- **Universal tendency**: All people have the tendency to connect with others of a similar kind

### 2. Instrumentalist Approach

#### Associated Scholar

- **FREDERICK BARTH**: Takes an instrumentalist approach

#### Core Difference from Primordialist View

- **Not primordial attachment**: It is not some primal, primordial kind of attachment that people have to ties of blood
- **Matter of choice**: Ethnic identification is a matter of choice
- People choose which ethnic group they want to associate with and belong to

#### Situational Nature

- **Depends on social situation**: Choice depends on the social situation
- **Examples of shifting identity**:
  - If there's an agitation for separate statehood based on linguistic identity, then linguistic identity becomes primary
  - If there's demand for caste-based reservation, then caste identity becomes most salient
  - If there's a Ram Janmabhoomi issue, then Hindu identity becomes prominent

#### Fluid Nature of Ethnic Identity

- **Not fixed**: Ethnic identity is not fixed; it is very fluid
- **Changes with situation**: It changes as the situation changes
- **BARTH's argument**: Ethnic groups are not fixed
- **Continuous negotiation**: Ethnic identities are continuously negotiated in the social context
- **Ethnic boundaries**: Are continuously drawn and redrawn based on the demands of the changing socio-political situation

## CONDITIONS FOR ETHNIC STRATIFICATION (48:40)

### DONALD NOEL's Theory

**DONALD NOEL** says that ethnic stratification emerges in a society when certain conditions are fulfilled:

1. **Contact**: Different ethnic groups are brought in contact with each other
2. **Competition**: Their interaction is characterized by competition for limited resources
3. **Power differences**: There are differences in power between the groups
4. **Ethnocentrism**: There is development of ethnocentrism

#### Understanding Ethnocentrism

- **Definition**: An attitude that my culture, my way of life is superior to yours and is the only correct one
- **Examples**:
  - Alcohol consumption preferences (those who drink vs those who don't)
  - Food habits (vegetarian vs non-vegetarian)
  - Marriage practices (high divorce rates - good or bad?)

#### Applications

- **Caste conflicts**: Can be understood as a form of ethnic stratification
- **Communal conflicts**: Hindu-Muslim riots can be understood as manifestations of ethnic tension
- **Tribal conflicts**: Conflicts and hierarchy between tribal groups (like in Manipur)

## SOCIAL MOBILITY CONCEPTS (56:45)

### Definition of Social Mobility

- **SOROKIN's definition**: Social mobility refers to any transition of an individual from one social position to another
- **Simple explanation**: Movement from one position in society to another

#### Examples

- A person who is rich loses his wealth and becomes poor - this is social mobility
- A person from humble background works hard, acquires education, and becomes middle class - this is social mobility

## TYPES OF SOCIETIES BASED ON MOBILITY (58:49)

### Open Systems

- **Definition**: A society which permits social mobility
- **Characteristics**:
  - No structural barriers to mobility
  - Not only absence of barriers but also mechanisms which promote/encourage/facilitate mobility
  - Open systems actively facilitate individuals
  - Provide avenues through which people can change their social position

#### Examples and Mechanisms

- **Class-based social systems** in developed societies are open systems
- **How society facilitates mobility**:
  - Through education
  - Skill acquisition
  - Talent development
  - Hard work opportunities
  - Enterprise

#### Treatment of Members

- **Equality principle**: Open systems tend to treat their members as equals
- **Equality of opportunity**: Society strives to provide all people equal opportunity to realize their potential

### Closed Systems

- **Definition**: Society which does not permit social mobility
- **Characteristics**:
  - Erects barriers - there are structural barriers which prevent people from transitioning from one social position to another
  - Membership and social position is determined by birth (ascriptive criteria)
  - Society maintains rigid boundaries between social groups

#### Examples

- **Caste system**: Classic example of closed system
- **Rigid boundaries**: Brahmans are clearly distinct from Rajputs, Jats, and Shudras
- **No crossover**: If I am Shudra today, I cannot become Rajput tomorrow and Brahman the day after

## TYPES OF SOCIAL MOBILITY (66:42)

### 1. Vertical vs Horizontal Mobility

#### Vertical Mobility

- **Definition**: Movement from one social strata to a higher or lower social strata
- **Example**: If I was born poor and became rich - this is vertical social mobility

##### Types of Vertical Mobility

1. **Upward Mobility**: Movement from one strata to a higher social strata
   - Example: Son of agricultural laborer becomes civil servant
2. **Downward Mobility**: Movement from a strata to a lower strata
   - Example: Person born in wealth loses that wealth
   - Widowhood can cause downward mobility for women

#### Horizontal Mobility

- **Definition**: Movement from one social position to another at roughly the same level
- **Example**: Agricultural laborer in village becomes laborer on construction site in city
- **Characteristic**: Shifting takes place without any noticeable change in the social position of the individual in the vertical direction

### 2. Intergenerational vs Intragenerational Mobility

#### Intergenerational Mobility

- **Definition**: We compare the social positions of fathers and sons
- **Example**: If I am born to a farm laborer but I become a doctor - this is intergenerational mobility
- **Significance**: More important for policymakers and social scientists

#### Intragenerational Mobility

- **Definition**: Within the same generation - same person's social position is assessed at the beginning and end of his career
- **Example**: I was a farm laborer in my youth but over time became a factory supervisor

#### Which is Higher?

- **Expectation**: Intergenerational mobility can reasonably be expected to be higher
- **Reason**: Less likely that I start as farm laborer at age 20 and become IAS officer, but more likely that son of farm laborer becomes IAS officer

## SOURCES AND CAUSES OF SOCIAL MOBILITY (79:49)

### SOROKIN's Four Main Factors

#### 1. Demographic Factors

- **Occupational structure changes** as capitalism advances
- **Early capitalism structure**:
  - Most jobs were manual and lowly jobs
  - Fewer middle-level managerial positions
  - Minuscule ruling class
- **Advanced capitalism**: Middle-level occupations tend to expand
- **Fertility rate differences**: 
  - Lower classes tend to have higher fertility rate than higher and middle classes
  - Who will fill up the middle-level jobs? Children from lower classes
- **Result**: Difference in fertility rates between classes combined with expanding job opportunities in the middle level contributes to social mobility

#### 2. Dissimilarities Between Parents and Children

- **Key point**: Talents, abilities, competence are not family-specific and not passed down the gene pool
- **Reality**: I may be very capable and talented, but my children may be incapable and untalented
- **Consequence**: Social position of a family will change with changes in the abilities of its members in every generation
- **Smart parents can breed stupid children and vice versa**

#### 3. Change of Social Environment

- **Environmental changes affect different occupations differently**
- **Examples**:
  - Bicycle makers may make lot of money at one point, but after bicycles go out of fashion, their fortunes dwindle
  - Typewriter operators had huge demand in certain era, now completely out of fashion
- **Principle**: As environment changes, so will the fortunes of different categories of persons

#### 4. Faulty Distribution

- **Problem**: If distribution of people were only as per their abilities, you would find people with skills and merit at top levels and people without skills at lower levels
- **Reality**: There is faulty distribution - lots of people with huge amounts of talent, ability, skills, knowledge in the lower strata while people devoid of skills in higher strata
- **Need**: Society needs to rectify this faulty situation
- **SOROKIN's view**: Channels of vertical circulation exist in every stratified society and are as necessary as channels for blood circulation in the body

#### Benefits of Mobility Channels

- **SOROKIN's argument**: These are like staircases or elevators
- **Purpose**: Ensure effective allocation of talents to occupations

### Modern Factors for Enhancing Mobility

#### Education

- **Primary tool**: Education is one of the primary tools for social mobility in modern societies
- **Benefits**: Gives knowledge, capabilities, awareness of one's rights
- **Examples**: ABRAHAM LINCOLN, BR AMBEDKAR, APJ ABDUL KALAM - born in humble families but rose to top positions

#### Employment Opportunities

- **Economic growth**: Higher rate of mobility results from economic development
- **Industrialization and urbanization**: Creates new jobs, provides anonymity in cities
- **Market expansion**: Creates demand for various skills

#### Legislative Measures

- **Examples in India**:
  - Right to primary education
  - Equal pay for equal work
  - Non-discrimination in public employment based on caste
  - Affirmative action policies

#### Skill Development

- **Marketable skills**: If people are imbued with right kinds of marketable skills, they can fetch good remuneration

#### Social Movements

- **Community empowerment**: Political mobilization creates greater opportunities
- **Example**: Dalit movement has created greater access to opportunities for Dalits

#### Democratization

- **Democratic ideals**: Liberty and equality enable people to rise up
- **Equal treatment**: Only when people are treated equally can they access same opportunities
- **Freedom**: Only in democratic society people will be free to pursue occupations unhindered by social background

## STUDIES OF SOCIAL MOBILITY (106:04)

### DAVID GLASS Study (England, 1949)

#### Key Findings

- **Rate of mobility**: The rate of social mobility in England is fairly high
- **Pattern**: Most mobility is short range
- **Short range mobility**: People are mostly moving to nearby levels, not from bottom to top
- **Example**: Worker's son becoming supervisor, supervisor's son becoming worker - but rare for sweeper's child to become CEO

### PEW Research Study (America, 2012)

#### Title: "Pursuing the American Dream"

#### The American Dream Concept

- **Definition**: American society provides ample opportunities for all, irrespective of people's background
- **Promise**: If you are willing to work hard, capable, and earnest, you will make it one day
- **Perception**: America seen as land of opportunities and equality of opportunity

#### Key Findings

- **Belief vs Reality**: American people greatly believed in American Dream, but it is mostly not realized
- **43% of Americans raised in bottom quintile remain stuck there**
- **40% of Americans in top quintile remain there**
- **Stickiness**: High chance that you will remain in the income level you were born into
- **Only 4% of Americans raised in bottom quintile reach the top quintile**
- **Conclusion**: Your parental background and social background greatly affects how much you will earn as an adult

### Global Social Mobility Index (2020)

#### Compiled by World Economic Forum

- **Coverage**: 82 countries
- **Based on five parameters**:
  1. Health
  2. Education  
  3. Work opportunities
  4. Social protection and inclusive institutions
  5. Access to technology

#### Key Findings

- **General pattern**: In most societies, children born in less affluent families experience greater barriers to success than those born in more affluent families
- **Limited opportunity**: Very few countries have conditions that foster social mobility
- **Top performers**: Denmark, followed by Norway, Finland, Sweden
- **United States**: Ranked at 27
- **India**: Ranks at 76 out of 82 countries

#### Policy Recommendations

- **Cooperation needed**: Governments and businesses need to come together to enable social mobility through:
  - Progressive taxation system
  - Preventing concentration of wealth
  - Offering holistic protection to workers
  - Promoting inclusive growth

## BENEFITS OF SOCIAL MOBILITY (124:04)

### Economic Benefits

- **Higher rate of economic growth**: If society has higher rate of mobility, people's capabilities will be better utilized
- **Better resource allocation**: Talents will be put to better use, skills will be better harnessed
- **Efficient talent allocation**: Will fuel economic growth

### Social Benefits

#### Meritocratic Society

- **More efficient allocation of roles**: If I have ability and I am performing commensurate role, society benefits
- **Appears more just and fair**: To members of society at large
- **Greater acceptability**: Society where capable person becomes leader regardless of background seems more fair

#### Innovation and Development

- **Boosts innovation**: People irrespective of background will have chance to explore, contribute to innovation, experiment
- **Technological development**: Will spur innovation and technological development

#### Social Stability

- **FRANK PARKIN's concept**: High rate of mobility serves as a political safety valve
- **Prevents frustration**: From building up among lower strata
- **Provides opportunities**: For those with capabilities in lower strata to rise up
- **Stabilizes system**: Instead of people rising up in bloody revolution

#### Impact on Class Solidarity

- **Weakens working class solidarity**: Both upwardly mobile and downwardly mobile tend to weaken working class solidarity
- **Upwardly mobile**: Identify with middle class (the class they have joined) rather than class of origin
- **Downwardly mobile**: Continue to identify with their class of origin (middle class) because they hope to regain their old status

### KLAUS SCHWAB's Analysis

- **Position**: Chairman of World Economic Forum
- **Socioeconomic consequences**: Of inequality of opportunity (low rate of mobility) are profound
- **Economic impact**: Increase in mobility by 10% will boost the world's economy by nearly 5% by 2030
- **Social cohesion**: Will also contribute to greater social cohesion
- **Biggest beneficiaries**: Countries like China, US, and India will gain the most from increase in social mobility

## CONCEPTS OF EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY (148:51)

### Definition of Equality

#### HAROLD LASKI's Definition

- **Equality means**: No man shall be so placed in society that he can over-reach his neighbor to the extent which constitutes a denial of the latter's citizenship
- **Simple meaning**: Nobody should be in such a position in society that he can deny another person his basic citizenship rights
- **Core principle**: You should not be able to prevent me from enjoying my rights

### PETER SAUNDERS' Three Types of Equality

#### 1. Formal Equality

- **Legal equality**: Equal treatment under law

#### 2. Equality of Opportunity

- **Equal chances**: All people should have equal opportunity to realize their potential

#### 3. Equality of Outcome

- **Equal results**: Everyone should have same outcomes/wealth

#### Modern Society's Preference

- **Focus**: Most modern societies have established formal equality and are striving for greater equality of opportunity
- **Not outcome equality**: Modern societies do not pursue equality of outcome

#### Problems with Equality of Outcome

- **Motivation loss**: Motivation to work hard will die
- **Inefficiency**: Efficiency will be reduced
- **Injustice**: Will be unfair to those who work harder
- **Economic stagnation**: Can lead to economic problems like USSR experienced

#### SAUNDERS' Warning

- **Potential conflict**: Equality of outcome, if pursued, will militate against equality of opportunity
- **Can lead to injustice**: If I work harder than you and we both get same at end of month, it is injustice to me

### Measures Toward Greater Equality

#### Progressive Taxation

- **Principle**: People with higher levels of income will be subjected to higher tax rate
- **Robin Hood function**: State collects increasing proportion of wealth from rich and redistributes to poor
- **India example**: Income tax slabs - up to 5 lakh is tax free, then 10%, 20%, 30%

#### Social Security Measures

- **For disadvantaged sections**: Unemployment allowance, insurance coverage, disability allowance

#### Affirmative Action

- **Policies like reservation**: To provide opportunities to marginalized groups

#### Legislative Measures

- **Examples**: Right to education, MGNREGA, PDS (Public Distribution System)

#### Constitutional Provision

- **Directive Principles**: Reduction of socioeconomic inequalities is one of the Directive Principles of State Policy in Indian Constitution

## INEQUALITY ANALYSIS (160:53)

### ROUSSEAU's Two Types of Inequality

#### 1. Natural Inequality (Physical Inequality)

- **Definition**: Differences in factors like health, age, bodily strength, mental abilities
- **Source**: Whatever nature has endowed us with
- **Significance**: Relatively small and unimportant, according to ROUSSEAU

#### 2. Social Inequality (Moral/Political Inequality)

- **Definition**: Differences in privileges that are established by people themselves
- **Examples**: Differences in prestige, power
- **Source**: Human-made inequality
- **Significance**: Far more decisive than natural inequalities

### WILKINSON and PICKETT's Analysis

#### Book: "The Spirit Level"

- **Subtitle**: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better
- **Core argument**: In a society, inequality should not be too high - inequality levels should not be very wide

#### Why High Inequality is Harmful

##### Health and Stress

- **High levels of inequality can lead to high levels of stress and poor health**
- **Reason**: People will not be treated with dignity, society does not give them equal chance
- **Impact**: Stress and health problems reduce economic growth

##### Loss of Dignity

- **In highly unequal societies, people are robbed of their pride and dignity**
- **Affected group**: People in lower strata
- **Consequence**: If inequality levels are too high, greater bulk of population gets stuck in lower strata

##### Crime and Violence

- **Those relegated with low social status will lead to increase in crime rates, violence, killings**
- **Impact**: If I am poor, it is not only harmful for me but for whole society

##### Trust and Cooperation

- **High levels of inequality undermine trust and mutual cooperation**
- **Problem**: Different people belonging to different strata will look at each other with suspicion
- **Result**: Prevents smooth functioning of society

#### Need for Some Inequality

- **Required amount**: Some amount of inequality is required
- **Purpose**: To motivate people and perform various functions we have already discussed
