# Sociology as a Science: Positivism vs Antipositivism

## Introduction and Recap of American Sociology (19:32)

- Quick recap of sociology's emergence in the USA during the civil war period (1861-1865)
- **American Social Science Association**: Established in 1865, mainly inspired by the writings of SPENCER
- **SPENCER's Theory**: Social Darwinism (not sociological Darwinism) - supported by rich people as it validated their thinking that they deserved power and privilege because they were the fittest and most capable
- **LESTER FRANK WARD**: Next important figure who took over from SUMNER and gave American sociology a different direction
  - **Book**: Dynamic Sociology
  - **Position**: Governments should intervene in social affairs, laws of social evolution should not be allowed free play entirely
  - Providing basic facilities to all sections of society, particularly the disprivileged and vulnerable
- **Progressive Era**: Period of social activism
- **Chicago School**: Natural laboratory for sociological researchers due to rapid urbanization
  - Opportunities to study deviance, crime, policing, drug abuse, traffic problems, juvenile delinquency
  - **Key Scholars**: PARK, BURGESS, SHAW

## Student Discussion: Is Sociology a Science? (45:13)

### Initial Student Responses (Intuitive Understanding)

- **Students' Gut Reaction**: Emphatic "no" - sociology is not a science
- **Reasoning Given by Students**:
  - Every individual reacts differently to the same experiment, unlike particles in science
  - No universal laws that govern everything like in physics
  - Every society and interaction has uniqueness
  - Cannot have force = mass × acceleration equivalent in sociology
  - Human prejudices cannot be kept at bay like in physical sciences
  - Emotions of individuals must be taken into account
  - Sociology was part of arts stream in school, not science

### Additional Student Arguments Against Sociology as Science

- **Subjectivity vs Objectivity**: Sociology has both subjective and objective dimensions, science is purely objective
- **Personal Biases**: In conducting research on topics like communalism, people hold deep personal views due to living in society since birth
- **Variable Components**: Everything is subject to interpretation and varied interpretations
- **Controlled Environment**: Cannot conduct experiments in controlled environment which are integral to sciences
- **Cultural Specificity**: Meaning of family among Hindus different from Muslims, meaning of family in India different from America

## What is Science? (65:18)

### Definition of Science

- **Science**: A systematized body of knowledge based on empirical evidence or data
- **Scientific Discipline**: Formulates generalizations or establishes cause-effect relationships in order to explain the phenomena under study
- **Key Criterion**: A discipline can be termed as scientific if it uses the scientific method

### The Scientific Method

- **Components**:
  - Experimentation in a controlled environment
  - Observation and accurate recording of data
  - Processing the data
  - Framing generalizations or laws to establish relationship between variables under study

### Characteristics of Scientific Knowledge

1. **Verification**: Scientific knowledge is subject to verification - don't have to take anybody's word for it
2. **Universal Laws**: Scientific laws are universal and hold true across time and space
3. **Objectivity**: Research characterized by objectivity - values and prejudices of researcher do not affect outcome of research

## Positivism: Sociology as a Science (96:20)

### Definition and Origin

- **Positivism**: Philosophy which considers that sociology is a scientific discipline
- **Positivists Hold**: The scientific method can be applied to study the society
- **Term Origin**: From French word "positive" meaning imposed on the mind by experience
- **Core Principle**: Only true knowledge is that which is based upon sensory experience or empirical evidence

### Key Positivist Scholars

- **AUGUSTE COMTE**: Founder of positivism
  - **Book**: "A Course in Positive Philosophy"
  - Called sociology the **"Queen Science"**
- **EMILE DURKHEIM**: Also a positivist
- **KARL MARX**: Can be seen as positivist

### Main Principles of Positivism

1. **Unity of Scientific Method**: Same scientific method can be used across all sciences (physics, chemistry, sociology)

2. **Objective of Scientific Inquiry**: 
   
   - Explain phenomena under study
   - Develop generalizations or laws
   - Predict future outcomes

3. **Empirical Testability**: Scientific knowledge is empirically testable

4. **Objectivity**: Scientific knowledge should not be affected by researcher's values, prejudices, or moral preferences

### COMTE's Position on Sociology

- **Human Behavior**: Subject to invariable laws
- **Task of Sociologists**: Identify the laws governing human behavior and social life
- **Method**: Sociologist should treat subject matter in same way as physicist or chemist does

### DURKHEIM's Contribution

- **Social Facts**: Subject matter of sociology
- **First Rule**: Treat social facts as things (just like physicists deal with things)

### Positivist Research Method

- **Data Collection**: Collect empirical data about social world through observation or experimentation
- **Data Processing**: Objectively process data to identify patterns governing human behavior
- **Objectivity**: Characterized by objectivity irrespective of social background and value preferences of researcher
- **Conclusion**: Empirical data will lead all researchers to the same conclusion

### Positivist Argument for Objectivity

- **Example**: Research on domestic violence - whether male or female researcher, if data shows 31% women subjected to domestic violence, this will not change
- **Data Independence**: Data does not change with who the researcher is
- **Research Basis**: Conclusions based on data, not personal beliefs or prejudices

## Antipositivism: Sociology is Not a Science (151:55)

### Introduction to Antipositivism

- **Antipositivists**: Those who disagree with positivist contention that sociology is science
- **Starting Point**: MAX WEBER onwards, beginning of antipositivism
- **Alternative Name**: Social action approach
- **Core Argument**: Scientific method cannot be applied to study of society

### Fundamental Difference in Subject Matter

**Physical Sciences Study**: Inanimate objects, things, matter
**Sociology Studies**: Human beings, human behavior, human relationships

### Key Difference: Consciousness

- **Human Beings**: Thinking entities with consciousness (awareness of being)
- **Things/Objects**: Do not have capacity to think

### Mechanical vs Meaningful Response

#### Things (Example: Pen)

- React mechanically to external force/stimuli
- Predictable response: Apply 5 Newton → moves X distance; Apply 10 Newton → moves X + ΔX distance
- No thinking capacity
- Repetitive behavior depending on external stimuli

#### Human Beings

- **Do Not React Mechanically**: Apply meaning to external stimuli before reacting
- **Example - Being Pushed**: Different reactions based on:
  - Who is pushing (friend vs stranger vs bully)
  - Context (cricket stadium vs lonely street)
  - Personal interpretation (cast-based vs gender-based vs accidental)
  - Social background, personal experiences, mood

### Variable Human Behavior

- **No Predictable Patterns**: Human behavior varies greatly
- **Meaning Attribution**: People attach different meanings based on:
  - Social background of actor and counter-actors
  - Social context (age, religion, cast, class)
  - Personal life experiences
  - Mood at given moment
  - Situation and circumstances

### Fire Example

- **Thing (Pen)**: Will get heated, melt - no thinking involved
- **Human Response**: Varies by interpretation
  - Escape/run away
  - Try to extinguish
  - Sacred fire - different cultural meaning
  - Emergency response - "ladies and children first"

### Core Antipositivist Arguments

1. **No Universal Laws**: Cannot identify patterns in human behavior like "force = mass × acceleration"
2. **Individual Uniqueness**: Each person is unique specimen; behavior changes over time
3. **Agency**: Human beings have agency - are active agents, not passive responders
4. **Meaning Matters**: Internal processes (thinking, emotions, motives) are integral part of social reality

### Focus on Internal Processes

- **Positivist View**: What you think doesn't matter, only observable behavior matters
- **Antipositivist View**: Meanings, motives, emotional orientation cannot be ignored
- **Scientific Method Limitation**: Can only capture what is visible/external, not internal thoughts and meanings

### Positivism vs Antipositivism Comparison

| **Aspect**            | **Positivism**                              | **Antipositivism**                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Human Control**     | Man largely controlled by social forces     | Human beings have agency                        |
| **Behavior Patterns** | Clear patterns, laws govern social behavior | No fixed patterns, behavior varies greatly      |
| **Society's Role**    | Society decides how man behaves             | Man does not follow given script                |
| **Research Focus**    | External, observable actions                | Internal processes, meanings, motives           |
| **Methodology**       | Scientific method applicable                | Scientific method cannot capture social reality |
