# INDUSTRIALIZATION AND EVOLUTION OF THE INDIAN MIDDLE CLASS

## EVOLUTION OF MODERN INDUSTRY IN INDIA (26:49)

- **Industrialization Definition**: Use of machinery in the process of production to manufacture goods when increasingly human labor power is replaced by machinery
- Industrial revolution first took place in Europe, specifically in England, and India was also an English colony

### Similarities and Differences with Western Industrialization

**Similarities:**

- In both cases, the initiative came from the English
- The English introduced modern technologies and production technologies in India 
- Both were based on similar production technology - the same kind of machines were employed first for production on a mass scale in England and then in India

**Key Differences:**

- **Western Experience**: Before the industrial revolution, the Western society had undergone long periods of preparation spanning several centuries
  
  - There had been secularization - decline in the authority of religion in people's lives
  - The West had undergone phases of Enlightenment, before that the Renaissance period
  - This resulted in the growth of the cult of the individual - individualism replaced community orientation
  - Rationality and scientific temperament had been embedded in Western society before industrialization

- **Indian Experience**: India had not undergone a similar long drawn period of preparation like the West had
  
  - The process of industrialization was as if imposed from the top
  - We simply adopted technology which had been developed and perfected in the West
  - We only adopted their production technology without having undergone the same kind of societal mental preparations

### Role of the Colonial State in Indian Industrialization

The colonial state played a very central role in India's experience of industrialization by facilitating and contributing towards industrialization through:

1. **Modern Production Technology**: The British brought the modern production technology and machinery
2. **Factory System of Production**: Housing a large number of workers under one roof who man the machines and produce goods
3. **Railways**: Introduction of railways - India was among the first countries where railways were introduced despite being a colony
   - Railways greatly facilitated movement of goods, workers on a very large scale
   - Facilitated development of industrial capitalism
4. **Finance Arrangements**: Stock company form of organization - one of the first forms in which we met the British was the East India Company
5. **Modern Education**: Introduced non-religious education and established institutions of higher learning of science, engineering
6. **Breakdown of Jajmani System**: Its replacement by the market mechanism

### Counter-Nationalist Interpretation

- **Dadabhai Naoroji's Theory**: Outlined in his book "POVERTY AND UN-BRITISH RULE IN INDIA" - the drain of wealth theory
- **R.C. Dutt**: Another scholar supporting the nationalist interpretation

**Nationalist View:**

- Pre-colonial India was a thriving economy - contributing about 23% of global GDP
- India had 27% share in global trade before the advent of the British  
- By the time British left, India's share had come down to around 3-4% of global GDP and 2% in global trade
- British policies systematically impoverished the Indian people
- British policies favored British capital and systematically discouraged local artisans and handicrafts
- India became an exporter of cheap raw materials and a net importer of finished goods
- Before the British, India had several thriving world-renowned industries: spices, textiles manufacturing (Dhaka muslin was so fine that a full saree could pass through a ring), gems, ship building

## POST-INDEPENDENCE DEVELOPMENT PATHS (46:36)

### Two Schools of Thought After Independence

**1. Gandhian Approach:**

- Gandhi was against India blindly imitating the Western model of development
- Focused on restoring village level autonomy and independence
- Emphasized cottage industry, making charkha the symbol of independence movement
- Self-sufficiency at village and individual levels
- Decidedly against large scale industrialization like the West

**2. Nehru's Modernization Approach:**

- Nehru was a committed modernizer who fully subscribed to modernization theory
- Believed that if India has to progress and develop, it must industrialize on a massive scale
- Was very impressed with material prosperity witnessed during travels to the West
- Also impressed by the Soviet model where the state played a very central role in development

### Mixed Economy Model Adopted

**Path Adopted:**

- Mixed economy combining Western-style private entrepreneurship with significant state role
- Private enterprise was provided space to operate but was subjected to heavy regulation by the state
- Era called the "License Permit Quota Raj"
- Adopted from Soviets the model of centralized planning and five-year plans

**State Focus:**

- State particularly focused on heavy industry (steel, oil refineries) which are foundational and necessary for further industrialization
- As Nehru envisioned, big factories and big dams would be the temples of modern India
- Strong foundation was laid down for India's further industrialization

**Economic Performance:**

- Economy grew at a low rate of growth (3-3.5% annual growth rate)
- This was derisively termed as the "Hindu rate of growth"

### Liberalization Era (1990s)

**From LPQ to LPG:**

- Early 1990s: Indian economy was opened up due to forex reserves crisis
- Compelled India to open up its economy under structural adjustment program of World Bank and IMF
- Government's role in economy was systematically and significantly reduced

**Key Changes:**

- Privatization and disinvestment - government owned companies were sold to private players
- License permit quota raj was dismantled
- Government permissions required to start business were greatly reduced
- Reserved list (sectors reserved only for government) was greatly reduced - now only 2-3 areas remain where government retains monopoly
- Red carpet rolled out for multinational corporations

## INDUSTRIAL URBAN CLASS STRUCTURE (62:43)

### Classes in India's Industrial Economy

**Broad Classification:**

- Capitalist class
- Top level management, middle management  
- Professionals (doctors, teachers, lawyers, chartered accountants)
- Small traders and businessmen, self-employed retailers
- Skilled workers, semi-skilled workers, unskilled manual workers

**Simplified Three-Class Structure:**

1. **Capitalist Class**
2. **Middle Class** 
3. **Working Class**

### Nature of Indian Capitalist Class

**During Colonial Period:**

- **Earliest Indian Capitalists**: Belonged to traditional trading castes and communities
  - Marwaris of Kolkata
  - Parsis in the West  
  - Aroras and Khatris in Punjab
  - Chettiars in the South
- Initially began as partners of British imperialism as wholesalers, traders, financiers
- Later established their own factories

**Post-Independence Evolution:**

- During license permit quota regime, capitalist class remained small due to restricted access to licenses
- Social base remained narrow - preserved for established business families (Bajaj, etc.)
- **After Globalization**: Social base of capitalist class has expanded significantly

### Caste and Capitalism

According to **R. VAIDYANATHAN** in his book "CASTE AS SOCIAL CAPITAL":

**How Caste Networks Help:**

- **Community-based financing** and risk mitigation
- **Recruitment** - employing trustworthy people from same community  
- **Social mobility and entrepreneurship** - mentorship within community
- **Raising capital** - kinship networks provide financial support
- **Risk sharing** - business partnerships within community

**Vaishaivization Process:**

- Various castes have undergone process of vaishaivization (becoming vaishya varna)
- Includes Brahmins, OBCs, Scheduled Castes, Tribals
- Data shows 60% of all establishments are owned by SC, STs and OBCs ⭐ (This statistic seems unusually high and may need verification)

**Community Dominance Examples:**

- **Patidars of Surat**: Dominance in diamond trade
- **Nadars**: Manufacturing matches in Sivakasi  
- **Gounders**: Textile industry in Tiruppur

**Notable Absences:**

- **Dalits and Muslims** have not produced a good number of capitalists
- Very few women entrepreneurs (those who exist are mostly wives belonging to business families)

## MIDDLE CLASS IN INDIA (87:44)

### Defining the Middle Class

**Various Criteria for Definition:**

1. **Class Position**: Between capitalist class and manual working class (non-capitalist, non-manual working class)

2. **Occupational Profile**: White collar occupations such as lawyers, doctors, engineers, accountants, journalists, teachers, managers, administrators

3. **Disposable Income**: After meeting basic necessities, still left with money to spend on non-essentials like shampoo, scooter, fridge, TV

4. **Income Tax Returns**: Those who file ITR are middle class (peculiarly Indian way)

5. **Wealth Criteria**: Some scholars prefer wealth over income as it's more stable and translates into freedom from want and desperation

6. **Consumption Patterns**: Similar types of material possessions and consumption habits

7. **Self-Identification**: Those who consider themselves middle class

### Income and Wealth Estimates

**NCAER Classification (2012):**

- Middle class: ₹2 lakh to ₹10 lakh annual income

**KRISHNAN and HATEKAR Classification:**

- Uses consumption expenditure criteria in PPP US dollars per capita per day:
  - **Lower Middle Class**: $2-4 USD (44.6 crore people)
  - **Middle Middle Class**: $4-6 USD (10.8 crore people)  
  - **Upper Middle Class**: $6-10 USD (4.9 crore people)
- Total: About 60 crore people (roughly half the population)

**CREDIT SUISSE Report:**

- Wealth between ₹7.3 lakh to ₹73 lakh qualifies as middle class
- Only 2.3 crore people (about 2% of population) are middle class
- This middle class owns 22.6% of India's wealth
- Those above middle class own 64% of India's wealth

### Development of Middle Class in India

**During Colonial Period:**
According to **B.B. MISHRA** in "INDIAN MIDDLE CLASS - THEIR GROWTH IN MODERN TIMES":

- Indian middle class was formed as result of British policies
- British helped formation by putting in place modern education system
- High castes were first to send children to modern educational institutions
- After education, they took up modern middle class occupations (lawyers, doctors, engineers)
- This class provided leadership to socio-religious reforms (Roy and his ilk)
- Also assisted British in colonial project as managers, traders, lawyers serving British interests
- Later spearheaded the anti-colonial struggle and Indian National Movement

**After Independence:**

- Expansion of education contributed to middle class development
- Private sector was highly regulated, so economic growth and job opportunities were limited
- **Government jobs became principal mode of employment** for joining middle class ranks
- Overall growth during Nehruvian period was slow and limited

**Post-1990 Explosion:**
According to **GURCHARAN DAS** in "INDIA GROWS AT NIGHT":

- Economic reforms created immense opportunities for middle class
- Led to substantial poverty reduction and explosion of middle class
- Size grew from 2.5 crore (mid-1990s) to 40-60 crore people today

## NATURE OF INDIAN MIDDLE CLASS (144:49)

### Heterogeneity

According to **ANDRE BETEILLE**:

- Indian middle class is very heterogeneous - possibly compared to anywhere else in the world
- Internally differentiated in terms of two types of criteria:
  1. **Economic Criteria**: Income, occupation, education
  2. **Social Criteria**: Caste, linguistic identity, ethnicity

**Composition:**

- **Caste**: Draws from across castes including high castes, OBC, Dalits, Tribals
- **Religion**: Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain middle classes exist
- **Regional/Linguistic**: From all regions and linguistic backgrounds

### Rural Middle Class

According to **MARIUM ASLANI**:

- In developing countries like India, it's assumed middle class is urban phenomena
- However, India has a very large rural middle class (40% of India's middle class)
- Typically employed outside agriculture
- Aspire for private English medium education for their children

### Common Features

Despite heterogeneity, according to **PAVAN VERMA**, middle class shares:

1. **Middle Level Income**: Comfortable life but not lavish lifestyle
2. **Similar Material Possessions**: TV, fridge, personal vehicle, mobile phone, AC/cooler, heater, geyser, washing machine
3. **Education Emphasis**: Greatly emphasizes education, willing to spend substantial portion of income on education, even girls are educated
4. **Savings Orientation**: Very particular about savings
5. **Respectability**: Very particular about social respectability - perpetual anxiety that secrets should not get out
6. **Similar Aspirations**: Seeks stability, security, risk aversion in employment and income
7. **Material Aspirations**: Government job, car, fancy phone, bike, own house

**Path to Fulfillment**: Through education - hence middle class particularity about education, IIT, UPSC entrance exams represent middle class aspirations

### Middle Class as Harbinger of Modernity

According to **BETEILLE**:

- In every society, middle class is the harbinger of modernity
- Indian middle class also played this historical role
- First to take up modern education, modern jobs, undertook social reforms
- **However, Indian middle class is neither fully modern nor traditional - it is transitional**
- Its values are still in process of formation, not stabilized
- Values are not crystallized, still in state of flux
- Hence, sees lot of contradictions, conflicts, antagonisms (hypocrisy)
- Middle class will often do things which it will criticize in others (corruption, nepotism)

### Middle Class Women

**Characteristics:**

- All middle class women have received education - they are educated
- While some participate in workforce as working women, good number are homemakers
- **Caught between tradition and modernity**

**Traditional Elements:**

- Continue to be evaluated in terms of marital stability and motherhood
- Do not have final say for their own marriage
- Many traditional themes continue to resonate: notion of pativrarta (devoted to husband)
- For many, MATA SITA continues to be the ultimate cultural icon
- Ultimate objective in life is marriage and motherhood

**Modern Elements:**

- Modern education, many are graduates
- High participation in higher education system
- Wear western wear, speak English

**Assessment**: Have attained **superficial emancipation** - seem quite advanced and liberated superficially, but in important matters like marriage and employment, lack autonomy

## NEW INDIAN MIDDLE CLASS (171:47)

### Definition and Emergence

**Old vs New Middle Class:**

- **Old Middle Class**: Came up during colonial period
- **New Middle Class**: Product of globalization, emerged after economic reforms of early 1990s

According to **PAVAN VERMA** in "THE NEW INDIAN MIDDLE CLASS":

- New middle class is outcome of globalization
- Class identity has become very important for this new middle class
- Has been able to transcend caste boundaries
- Has developed clear class identity - doesn't matter whether you are Baniya or Jat, what matters is money in your pocket

**Connectivity:**

- Very well connected - every member owns a mobile phone

According to **LEELA FERNANDES** in "INDIA'S NEW MIDDLE CLASS":

- **English educated urban middle class is the new middle class**
- Different from old in terms of lifestyle and ethics

### Lifestyle Changes

**Earlier Middle Class:**

- Led very understated lifestyle
- Shied away from vulgar displays of wealth
- Did not engage in ostentatious displays of wealth

**New Middle Class:**

- **Defined by consumer ethos** - consumerist
- Loves to shop, fond of visiting malls
- No more hesitation to show off money
- Shows off even money they don't have (credit, EMI purchases)
- Very consumerist and outright declares its wealth
- **Brand obsessed** - prefers visible logos and branded items
- Started culture of gated communities with Spanish, Italian names
- Lives in areas with foreign names despite never having visited those places

## ROLE OF MIDDLE CLASS IN POLITICS AND DEVELOPMENT (180:34)

### Historical Role

**During Colonial Period:**
According to **B.B. MISHRA**: Middle class played very central role in anti-colonial politics, at forefront of the struggle

**After Independence:**
According to **PAVAN VERMA**: 

- Nehru state envisioned very important role for middle class in nation's development
- National leadership gave clarion call to middle class to contribute to national development
- Middle class responded enthusiastically
- Nehruvian state had belief and faith in middle class
- Middle class participated in national development enthusiastically in response to appeals by national leadership

**Middle Class Attitudes Shaped By:**

- Gandhian idealism and Nehru socialism

**Disengagement (Late 1960s):**

- By late 1960s, middle class had begun to disengage from politics
- New crop of leaders did not inspire same confidence as previous ones
- Political leadership also focused on poor and working class who were more numerous
- Consequently, middle class became increasingly inward looking

### Contemporary Political Role

**Political Awakening:**
According to **LEELA FERNANDES**: Political awakening of new middle class has coincided with rise of Hindu nationalism, though middle class politics cannot be reduced to Hindutva alone

**Current Influence:**

- New middle class asserted itself through civil society movements (Jessica Lal murder protests, Nirbhaya protests, anti-corruption agitation)
- In 2014 general elections, new middle class played decisive role
- By this time, new middle class was numerically big and therefore politically relevant

**Disproportionate Influence:**
According to **SATISH DESHPANDE**: Middle class enjoys disproportionate influence due to occupational profile (journalists, news editors, teachers) that affects public discourse

**Other Political Movements:**

- AAP in Delhi has huge middle class base
- Telangana Rashtra Samiti has huge middle class base
- Not just about Hindutva

### Critical Assessment

According to **HARSH MANDER** in "LOOKING AWAY":

- Middle class is biggest beneficiary of globalization
- Owes its existence to globalization process
- Therefore, middle class looks away from ill effects of globalization
- Has perfected art of looking away
- Ignores and looks away from ill effects on various sections of society (displaced tribals, urban poor not served by market mechanism)
- Since middle class benefits (jobs, cheap clothes), it closes eyes to ill effects of globalization
