### Dominant Caste Concept Review

- **Contributing factors to dominance**:
  
  - Numerical strength
  - Land ownership in agriculture
  - Wealth
  - Political power
  - Modern education
  - City-based jobs (also sources of wealth)

- **Relationship between ritual rank and dominance**: Higher ritual rank helps a caste emerge as dominant caste, but ritual purity alone doesn't ensure dominance

### Criticisms of Dominant Caste Concept

- **Modern times perspective**: Dominant family rather than dominant caste
- **Outdated concept**: The concept of dominant caste is outdated nowadays
- **African influence**: The structure was derived from African dominant tribes
- **Desanskritization**: Introduced by D.N. MAJUMDAR - reverse of Sanskritization when higher castes stop performing their own customs and rituals

## Andre Beteille's Definition of Caste (37:34)

### Beteille's Definition

- **Caste definition**: A small and named group characterized by:
  - Hereditary membership
  - Endogamy
  - A specific lifestyle
  - Associated with a traditional occupation
  - Under distinct status in a ritual status in a hierarchical system

### Beteille's View on Caste Decline

- **Areas of decline**: Caste is declining in three important areas of social life:
  1. **Occupation**: Traditional caste-occupation linkage weakening
  2. **Marriage**: Rules concerning marriage patterns changing
  3. **Food exchange and physical distance maintenance**: Rules becoming less strict

### Beteille's Retrospective Analysis

- **Economists' view validation**: In retrospect, economist friends were right when they commented that caste was increasingly becoming irrelevant and dying in modern Indian society
- **Srinivas also correct**: SRINIVAS was also right about the continued relevance of caste in post-independent modern Indian society
- **Dual reality**: Caste has importance in certain variant areas of our social lives and continues to retain its essence in modern Indian society

## Politics and Caste Revival (41:21)

### Electoral Politics Impact

- **New lease of life**: Politics has infused a new lease of life in an otherwise dying social institution of caste
- **Electoral politics effect**: Electoral politics has infused a new lease of life in an otherwise declining institution of caste

### Political Manifestations

- **Ticket distribution**: Most political parties factor in caste while distributing tickets, election tickets
- **Vote seeking**: Political leaders seek votes on the basis of caste and kinship, mobilizing their caste and kinship networks

### Reservation Policy Impact

- **OBC reservation significance**: The policy decision to implement reservation for OBCs (not SC reservation which has been there since the coming into force of the Constitution)
- **V.P. Singh government**: When V.P. Singh government implemented some of the recommendations of the MANDAL COMMISSION
- **Post-Mandal era**: Since then, no serious political scholarship, no TV debate analyzing elections was complete without delving into caste
- **Public discourse**: No public analysis and policy analysis or public debate discourse is complete without delving into its caste dimension

## Harmonic and Disharmonic Social Systems (46:34)

### Beteille's Book: Harmonic and Disharmonic Social Systems

#### Critique of Traditional Classification

- **Scholar reference**: Some scholars like LOUIS DUMONT have classified societies based on equality vs inequality
- **Dumont's classification**:
  - India as HOMO HIERARCHICUS (based on inequality/hierarchy)
  - West as HOMO EQUALIS (based on equality)
- **Beteille's criticism**: It is incorrect to term and regard Western societies as based on equality and Indian society as based on inequality

#### Beteille's Alternative Classification

- **Better classification**: It is better to classify societies as harmonic and disharmonic
- **Harmonic societies**: Those in which the theory and ideology is in sync with the practice
- **Consistency definition**: When there is sync between people's way of thinking and how the society is structured

#### Examples of Social Systems

| System Type | Ideology   | Practice   | Example                     |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Harmonic    | Inequality | Inequality | India                       |
| Harmonic    | Equality   | Equality   | Primitive tribes (possibly) |
| Disharmonic | Equality   | Inequality | Western societies           |
| Disharmonic | Inequality | Equality   | Ruled out by Beteille       |

### Harmonic System - India

- **Normative and existential order**: There is consistency between the normative order and the existential order
- **Example**: In India there is both ideology of inequality and the practice of inequality
- **No fundamental contradiction**: There is no fundamental contradiction between the normative order and the existential order

### Disharmonic System - Western Societies

- **Definition**: One in which there is lack of consistency between the normative order and the existential order
- **Example**: Modern industrial Western societies are egalitarian in aspiration but hierarchical in social organization
- **Men's attachment**: Men attach themselves to the principle of equality but encounter in their daily lives the presence of inequality
- **Between ideology and practice**: There is contradiction between ideology and practice
- **Essential instability**: Disharmonic systems are essentially unstable due to clash between ideology and practice

## Caste, Class and Power (64:18)

### Beteille's Trinitarian Model

- **Book title**: CASTE, CLASS AND POWER
- **Weberian influence**: Similar to WEBER's trinitarian model (class, status, party)
- **Indian Weber**: BETEILLE is considered Indian Weber

### Pre-Modern Society

- **Convergence**: In pre-modern society, caste, class and power converged
- **Pattern**:
  - High caste were also upper class
  - Lower caste were also lower class
  - Middle caste enjoyed middle amounts of money and power
- **Overlap**: High caste were also high on the power scale; middle caste were middle in terms of class and money and power scale; lower caste were also lower class and low on the power scale

### Modern Society Transformation

- **Broken linkage**: With modernization, the linkage between caste, class and power has been broken
- **New possibilities**:
  - Rich people belonging to lower caste
  - Lower caste people in positions of power
  - High caste people who are poor

### Cumulative vs Dispersed Inequality

- **Traditional system**: Cumulative inequality (all disadvantages concentrated)
- **Modern system**: Cumulative inequality has been replaced by dispersed inequality
- **Current reality**: Due to modernization, anything can happen - high caste person can be powerless and poor

## Caste Among Non-Hindu Communities (151:18)

### Two Views on Caste

- **Structural view**: Caste is a social structure
- **Cultural view**: Caste is an ideology and matter of values

#### Cultural View Perspective

- **Proponents**: DUMONT and HUTTON
- **Position**: Considers caste to be a uniquely Hindu phenomenon because Hindu scriptures provide the basis for the ideology of caste
- **Basis**: Opposition of pure and impure according to Hindu scriptures

#### Structural View Perspective

- **Proponents**: BAILEY, SRINIVAS, BERREMAN, KATHLEEN GOUGH
- **Position**: Caste is not a uniquely Hindu phenomenon
- **Argument**: Caste-type social groups are also found amongst various other communities (non-Hindu religious communities)

### Evidence of Caste Among Non-Hindus

- **Muslim communities**: Various castes like Sheikh, Syed, Pathan exist
- **Christian communities**: Also have caste divisions
- **Geographic spread**: Present even in Pakistan and Bangladesh

### Reasons for Caste Among Non-Hindu Communities

#### Historical Conversion Factor

- **Origin**: Bulk of non-Hindu population in India were converts sometime in the past from Hinduism to other faiths
- **Caste retention**: When they converted, they changed their religion but carried their caste with them to the new religious community
- **Popular saying**: "Religion can be changed, but caste never goes away"

#### Cultural Influence Factor

- **Majority influence**: Cultural influence of the majority Hindu community
- **Process**: Non-Hindu communities also imbibed elements of caste because of the cultural influence of their Hindu neighbors
- **Mechanism**: Due to cultural influence of majority Hindu population, non-Hindu communities also imbibed elements of caste

### Important Clarification

- **Religious vs social**: Caste is not present in Islam or Christianity as religions, but it is part of Muslim and Christian societies in South Asia
- **No scriptural basis**: Islamic and Christian scriptures do not sanction caste or provide basis for caste ideology, unlike Hindu scriptures
