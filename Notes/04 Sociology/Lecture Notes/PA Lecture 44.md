# Sociology Lecture: Civil Society Issues and Theories of Social Change

## Opening and Review of Previous Concepts (28:32)

- **Opening**: Good afternoon friends. Please close your eyes. Om Om [Music] Om Om [Music]

### Previous Topics Covered

- **State, Nation, Citizenship, Civil Society**: These are the things we had discussed in the last lecture

#### Definition of State

- **Four Elements of a State**:
  - Territory
  - People  
  - Government
  - Sovereignty

#### Types of Nations

- **Two Types of Nations**:
  
  1. **Civic Nations**: Based on common citizenship and belonging to the same state. That is the source of unity in a civic nation
  2. **Ethnic Nations**: Based on common culture

- **Scholar**: This classification of ethnic and civic nations was given by **MACRON**

- **Book**: "The Sociology of Nationalism"

#### Citizenship

- **Definition**: It is the legal status of full membership of a political community
- **Scholar**: **T.H. MARSHALL** 
- **Book**: "Citizenship and Social Class"

#### Marshall's Three Types of Rights

1. **Civil Rights**: Right to enter into contracts, freedom of speech, freedom of thought - all these are civic rights or civil rights
2. **Political Rights**: In the second stage (19th century)
3. **Social Rights**: In the next century (20th century)

#### Civil Society

- **Definition**: Non-government, non-business third sector of the public sphere
- **Previous Discussion**: We had discussed the role of civil society in a democracy and also particularly the evolution of civil society in India

## Issues and Challenges with Civil Society (35:16)

### Personal Reflection on Privilege and Giving Back

- **Question to Students**: How many of you feel that you are born in privilege and relative privilege? 
- **Follow-up**: Perhaps you have this sense of wanting to give back, to do something for the less fortunate?
- **Civil Society Role**: Civil society provides you that platform or opportunity. Civil society deals with or meets the various needs of the disprivileged sections of the society

### Barriers to Civil Society Engagement

#### Trust Issues

- **Primary Concern**: How do I know that the money I donate will be used for the right purposes?
- **Fear**: The NGO person's pockets will be filled instead
- **Tax Benefits**: It will be tax free also for that guy

#### Other Barriers

- **Lack of Resources**: "I don't have my own resources"
- **Cultural Factor**: In India, parents' money is children's money (foreign notion otherwise)
- **Lack of Time**: People think they can make a greater impact as civil servants than as volunteers and donors
- **Alternative Preference**: Some believe they can contribute more effectively through government service

### Major Issues Plaguing Indian Civil Society

#### 1. Trust Deficit

- **Root Cause**: Lack of transparency and accountability
- **Specific Issue**: Civil society organizations are very opaque, particularly when it comes to money matters

##### Transparency Paradox

- **Demand for Others**: Civil society organizations vehemently champion the cause of bringing political parties under the RTI ACT
- **Their Position**: They demanded that since political parties are funded by the public and work for the public, they should be regarded as public authorities under RTI
- **Political Parties' Response**: All political parties came together and responded - "You also come under this. Why? Because you also apparently work on the basis of donations of the public, you also claim to serve the public"
- **Civil Society Reaction**: There was a huge hue and cry raised by the civil society organizations to clamp down by the fastest state
- **Conclusion**: Not only are they very opaque in their financial dealings, they also want to preserve that opacity. There is great reluctance in civil society organizations to be forthright in their sources of funding

#### 2. Undue Pressure on Governments

- **Legislative Interference**: Civil society organizations sometimes put undue pressure on governments to pass certain kind of legislation, trying to determine or shape the legislative framework

##### Example: Anna Movement

- **Anti-corruption Agitation**: The anti-corruption agitation was pressurizing the government to pass the Jan Lokpal Bill
- **Drafted By**: Some members of the civil society
- **Question of Representation**: Who really are the true representatives of the people? Those leaders on the stage of the anti-corruption movement who have been able to bring together a crowd of 10,000, 20,000 for 10 successive days or members of parliament who have been elected by the due process representing a far larger constituency?
- **Usurping Decision Making**: Civil society is trying to usurp decision making which really belongs to the political legislative system
- **Accountability Issue**: If something goes wrong, who will be held accountable? It is the elected representatives, not the jhola-walas (civil society activists)

##### Recent Example: Farm Bills

- **Process**: The farm bills were passed by parliament after due consideration
- **Outcome**: The government was forced to roll them back under pressure from civil society because they literally held the country hostage
- **Disproportionate Power**: They wield disproportionately too much power and governments may be forced to succumb to that, but they are not accountable

#### 3. Representation Issues

- **Claims vs Reality**: Members of civil society claim to be a voice of the people, the masses. They claim to represent their concerns and interests. But do they really represent the concerns of the masses?

##### Case Studies

**MEDHHA PATKAR**:

- **Background**: One of the stalwarts of Indian civil society, one of the leading lights, very tall in stature
- **Electoral Performance**: After years of ground work as a civil society activist, she contested elections and lost to some regular legislator from one of the traditional political parties

**IROM SHARMILA**:

- **Background**: Iron Lady of Manipur, ended a more than 15 years fast against AFSPA

- **Image**: She was held as inspiring, iron lady imagery

- **Electoral Result**: She contested elections and secured fewer than 90 votes

- **Conclusion**: Her own locality people did not vote for her, probably, and she is this larger than life figure

- **Key Question**: Do they really represent the voice, the concerns, the interests of the people? When it comes to testing at the elections, often times they fail and fail miserably

#### 4. Anti-Development Activities

- **Development Projects**: Civil society members often engage in anti-development activities
- **Examples**: They launch protests and agitations against developmental projects

##### Narmada Bachao Andolan Case

- **Impact**: Thanks to the intervention of the Narmada Bachao Andolan, the project got delayed by several decades - the Sardar Sarovar Dam project in Gujarat got delayed by several decades
- **Consequences**: This led to cost overruns. All the benefits which could have accrued to the people - cheap electricity, clean electricity, irrigation facilities - all of that got delayed

##### Professional Protesters (Andolanjeevis)

- **Prime Minister's Term**: PM coined a special term - "Andolanjeevis"
- **Definition**: There is this gang of protesters who are seen at almost every second protest
- **Example**: YOGENDRA YADAV - one of the members of civil society, earlier associated with Aam Aadmi Party, was in the anti-corruption agitation and farmer's agitation
- **Criticism**: These are professional protesters whose reason for existence is to protest. Their main life goal is to find faults and sit on dharnas
- **Impact**: This makes running the country difficult
- **Effect on Growth**: Professional protesters and andolanjeevis stall developmental projects which retards the growth of the country

#### 5. International Funding Issues and Foreign Influence

- **Allegation**: Civil society organizations are foot soldiers of foreign powers
- **Examples**: Soros Foundation type organizations
- **Destabilization**: They destabilize governments, not just in India but in many third world countries, fomenting agitations, so-called popular protests and uprisings
- **Manipulation**: People can be manipulated by civil society since they are in touch with people on the ground
- **Separatist Movements**: Funding for Khalistan movement or other secessionist movements

#### 6. Loss of Grassroots Connection

**Irony of Success**:

- **Original Advantage**: Civil society organizations were considered as grassroots organizations - small in size, localized, working with the people, understanding people's needs better, less lie
- **Problem with Growth**: As a civil society organization becomes successful, it also grows in size and becomes more bureaucratized
- **Lost Advantage**: The advantage that it had of being small size, closer to the people etc. is lost

**Example**:

- **CRY (Child Relief and You)**: 15-20 years ago, its CEO used to earn several lakhs
- **Recruitment Pattern**: These NGOs source their manpower from the top B-schools of the country and pay them attractive packages
- **Result**: The initial advantage of being small size, grassroots, closer to the people gets lost. It becomes very bureaucratized, formal

#### 7. Legal Violations

- **FCRA Violations**: Many civil society organizations violate laws like the FCRA
- **Examples**: 
  - **Centre for Policy Research**: YAMINI AYYAR is the head, daughter of MANI SHANKAR AYYAR
  - Many NGOs are not complying with their legal obligations of financial probity

**IB Report (2014)**:

- **Secret Report**: Available on the internet
- **Findings**: Many NGOs/civil society organizations are basically operating on an anti-India plank
- **Foreign Funding**: They are being promoted by foreign powers, foreign money to discredit India
- **Methods**: 
  - Stalling developmental projects
  - Protests against nuclear projects (Kudankulam)
  - Dam building protests
  - Claiming discrimination against tribals, Muslims by Indian state

#### 8. Political Inclinations

- **Claim**: Civil society organizations claim to be apolitical
- **Reality**: Does that claim really hold water?

**Examples**:

- **Anna Agitation**: Had everything to do with Aam Aadmi Party - it birthed the Aam Aadmi Party
- **RSS and BJP**: Has nothing to do with BJP and has no preference for BJP (sarcasm)
- **TEESTA SETALVAD**: Another fiery activist, organization is Communalism Combat, working in Gujarat. She has been recently facing court cases for allegedly fabricating evidence against then Chief Minister Modi for his involvement in the Godhra riots

**Conclusion**: Clearly, often times civil society organizations have political inclinations, preferences and agenda. No one is politically neutral or outside.

#### 9. Proliferation Issues

**Statistics**:

- **Total NGOs in India**: According to one government estimate, about 32 lakh NGOs
- **Ratio**: This translates to about one NGO per 400 persons
- **Comparison**: Police personnel strength - 0.6 police personnel per 400 people
- **Conclusion**: More NGOs than police personnel (individuals vs organizations)

**Problems with Over-abundance**:

- **Quality Issues**: Many are fly-by-night kind of operators
- **Paper Organizations**: Five NGOs running from one room address in Katwaria Sarai, Delhi - they exist only on paper
- **One-man NGOs**: Many have no personnel except the founder
- **Lack of Training**: Most persons involved in civil society sector do not have any formal training and education in this field
- **Professional Requirements**: It is a professional domain requiring certain proficiency

**Examples of Inadequate Training**:

- **Suicide Helplines**: Many NGOs run these, but those attending calls are not equipped to be counselors
- **Poor Service**: They will treat beneficiaries very shabbily
- **Fund Mismanagement**: Problems with funds mismanagement, improper reporting of activities and funding patterns, ethical considerations

#### 10. Financial Dependency

**Sources of Funding**:

- **Primary Sources**: Government and corporates
- **Individual Donations**: Amount to nothing
- **CSR Mandate**: Corporate Social Responsibility was made mandatory - all companies above a certain turnover have to keep a designated percentage (2% odd)
- **Independence Compromise**: These two main sources significantly compromise their independence
- **Dependency Issue**: If you depend on government for money, will you raise voice against that government? Can you maintain a watchful eye?

#### 11. Illegal Activities

**Criminal Activities**:

- **Child Trafficking**: Cases by children's homes
- **Sexual Exploitation**: Widows' homes engaged in sexual exploitation and trafficking of widows
- **Illegal Conversions**: Many NGOs have received funding for allegedly illegal conversions by inducement (Kerala example)
- **Mob Lynching**: For the sake of secularism, many civil society activists also engage in mob lynching. Gau rakshaks are part of civil society

**Conclusion**: Civil society does not have very clean hands.

## Social Change in Modern Society (71:58)

### Unit Introduction

- **Topics to be Covered**:
  - Sociological theories of social change
  - Development and dependency theory
  - Various agents of social change
  - Specifically: Education and social change, Science and technology as agent of social change

### Definition of Social Change

#### M.E. JONES Definition

- **Social Change**: A term used to describe variations in and modifications of any aspect of social organization, social patterns, social interactions and social processes

#### MACIVER Definition

- **Social Change**: Simply in quotes "a change in human relationships"

### Previous Study of Social Change

- **Throughout Syllabus**: Social change is one theme throughout the syllabus
- **Examples**:
  - Why did sociology emerge? Due to social change
  - New forms of family emergence
  - Shift from mechanical to organic solidarity
  - Marxist theory of historical materialism  
  - Parsons' theory of dynamic equilibrium
  - Secularization
  - Social movements bring social change

### Nature of Social Change

- **Universal Phenomenon**: Since when has society started changing? It was always changing
- **Varying Pace**: A society may change slowly or at a faster pace
- **Constant Process**: No society ever is static. Change is the only constant
- **Continuous**: Every society at any point of time is changing

## Theories of Social Change (82:32)

### Functional Theory of Social Change

- **Already Covered**: From Parsons and Durkheim's writings
- **Durkheim's Explanation**: Society changes due to changes in three factors - volume, material density, moral density (population, population density, frequency of interaction). As they increase, society changes from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity
- **Parsons' Explanation**: Dynamic equilibrium - earlier equilibrium will be disturbed but a new equilibrium will be arrived at, and this process will go on

#### Criticisms of Functional Theory

- **Limitation**: Sees change as basically harmonious, adaptive, gradual and incremental
- **Inadequacy**: Does not adequately address conflict as a source of social change
- **Gap**: Does not adequately explain abrupt, disruptive, violent changes

### Marxist Theory of Social Change

- **Economic Base**: Why do changes take place? Due to improvements in production technology
- **Mode of Production**: As technology improves, the mode of production changes from primitive communism to ancient slave to feudal to capitalist to eventually communist
- **Superstructure**: As changes take place in the economy, they also get reflected in the superstructure
- **Class Struggle**: "The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle"
- **Revolutionary Change**: Eventually it will be a bloody revolution which will transform the society taking it towards the final stage which is communism
- **End of History**: History ends at the stage of communism

## Evolutionary Theory of Social Change (88:42)

### HERBERT SPENCER's Social Darwinism

- **Influence**: Darwin gave theory of evolution in context of life forms and biology
- **Application**: Spencer uses about the same framework to explain changes in human societies
- **Universal Law**: Spencer gave a universal law of evolution

#### What is Evolution?

- **Biological Context**: From a simple entity to a complex one
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Function**: The evolved state (complex organism) performs more number of functions
  - **Size**: Generally also increases in size as level of complexity increases

#### Spencer's Universal Law of Evolution

- **Application**: All structures in the universe develop from a simple undifferentiated homogeneity to a complex differentiated heterogeneity
- **Universal Scope**: This law is applicable to galaxies, biological organisms, solar systems and also to societies

#### Stages of Social Evolution According to Spencer

1. **Simple Society**: Corresponds to headless bands (no chief, small band of wanderers and gatherers)
2. **Compound Society**: Represented by tribal chiefdoms 
3. **Doubly Compounded Society**: Monarchies and city states
4. **Trebly Compounded Society**: The modern nation state

#### Process Characteristics

- **Differentiation**: This process of increasing differentiation is accompanied by integration between the differentiated parts
- **Coordination**: There is coordination between the hands, eyes, and tummy (organic analogy)
- **Society**: Likewise in society there is interdependence and coordination between its different parts

### Other Evolutionary Theorists

#### FERDINAND TONNIES

- **Transition**: Society changes from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft
- **Gemeinschaft**: Represents community
- **Gesellschaft**: represents society
- **Characteristics**: Same difference between mechanical and organic solidarity or pre-modern and modern society

#### LEWIS HENRY MORGAN

- **Stages**: From savagery to barbarism to civilization
- **Savagery**: People in jungles
- **Barbarism**: Agriculture-based production and some sort of kingship
- **Civilization**: The modern industrial society

#### COMTE

- **Three Stages**: Society passes through three stages from theological stage to metaphysical stage to positive stage
- **Theological Stage**: Explanations are primarily religious in character (Europe before Renaissance)
- **Metaphysical Stage**: Explanations are abstract and philosophical (Renaissance till French Revolution)  
- **Positive Stage**: Scientific explanations (after French Revolution)

#### MARX as Evolutionary Theorist

- **Stages**: Primitive communism, ancient slave, feudal, capitalist, communist society
- **Problem**: Not all theoreticians agree that Marx can be regarded as evolutionary theorist
- **Reason**: His theory is also revolutionary - at every stage there is class struggle resulting in transition to the next
- **Exam Strategy**: Do not mention Marx in evolutionary theories unless specifically asked to analyze Marxism as evolutionary theory

### Criticisms of Evolutionary Theories

#### 1. Linear and Unidirectional

- **Limitation**: These theories see change as linear and unidirectional in one given direction
- **Counter-example**: Can a society in scientific stage not turn towards religion? We see religious revival in many modern complex industrial societies

#### 2. Eurocentric

- **Bias**: Based on European experience, and based on European experience the stages were formulated
- **Universal Application**: Critics question the universal application of theories derived from European experience
- **Reality**: Different societies may follow different trajectory of development

#### 3. Ethnocentric

- **Scholar Bias**: These theories have been mostly framed by Europeans who suffered from ethnocentric bias
- **Superiority Complex**: They saw their present society as superior to other cultures and societies
- **Language Evidence**: Even language reveals their ethnocentric bias - "savagery," "barbarism" - clearly reveals their ethnocentric bias

#### 4. End Point Problem

- **Static Final Stage**: These theories suggest that change ends at a certain point of time
- **Contradiction**: Critics suggest that no society is ever unchanging. Change never stops. No society can be unchanging
- **Social Change**: Social change is an ever-going kind of process. No society can ever become completely static
- **Final Stage Problem**: But in these theories there is a final stage

## Cyclical Theories of Social Change (121:33)

### Contrast with Evolutionary Theories

- **Evolutionary View**: Society is always progressing, becoming better, improving
- **Sequential Improvement**: Each subsequent stage is better than the previous stage in terms of technology, complexity, economic prosperity
- **Cyclical View**: Societies need not always develop and change for the better. Societies can also decline, even die

### Key Difference

- **Evolutionary**: Change as moving only in a particular direction
- **Cyclical**: Societies may come back to an earlier stage
- **Direction**: Change according to cyclical theories need not be always progressive

### Examples of Cyclical Views

- **Hindu Philosophy**: Satyuga → Treta Yuga → Dwapar Yuga → Kalyug → Satyuga (cyclical view of social change)

### PITIRIM SOROKIN's Theory

#### Book

- **Title**: "Social and Cultural Dynamics"

#### Core Concept

- **Cultural Mentalities**: Societies pass through different kinds of cultural mentalities
- **Definition**: Cultural mentality defines the nature of reality or the nature of human needs and what are the life goals

#### Three Types of Cultural Mentalities

1. **Ideational**: Reality is spiritual
2. **Sensate**: Reality is materialistic  
3. **Idealistic**: A synthesis of the two

#### Cyclical Nature

- **Pattern**: Like a pendulum oscillating between these three stages
- **Comparison**: Quite akin to Comte's stages of theological, metaphysical and positive
- **Difference**: Comte sees it as linear while Sorokin proposes a cyclical theory - society oscillates between them

#### Current Western Society

- **Present Stage**: Sensate stage
- **Movement**: Moving towards the idealistic stage with increasing turn towards spirituality, religious revival and interest in eastern mysticism

### SPENGLER's Theory

#### Book

- **Title**: "Decline of the West" (very provocatively titled)

#### Core Argument

- **Finite Life Span**: Every society has a finite life span. Every civilization has a finite life span of about a thousand years
- **Inevitable Decline**: After that, that civilization declines
- **Western Civilization**: According to him, the Western civilization has lived through its life span, so now its decline is imminent. The West is gonna decline. The Western civilization will soon decline

#### Reception

- **Western Response**: When he wrote this in the Western world, it caused a lot of heartburn
- **Context**: According to many scholars, they were on the pinnacle of material, technological progress and material prosperity, technological progress, and in 20th century he is saying that you are going to end
- **Reception**: So it was not taken too well

### ARNOLD TOYNBEE's Response

#### Challenge-Response Theory

- **Reaction**: Arnold Toynbee's writings were almost in response to Spengler's writings
- **Core Argument**: Civilizational decline is not inevitable
- **Study Scope**: He studied about 26 or so major civilizations across the globe
- **Definition**: He defined civilizations in terms of their religion (Hindu civilization, Islamic civilization)

#### Key Mechanism

- **Challenges**: Every civilization during its life faces various challenges
- **Creative Minorities**: If the ruling elites of the civilization are able to offer creative solutions to address those challenges, if the ruling elites are able to devise creative solutions, then the civilization will thrive, prosper, grow
- **Dominant Minorities**: If the ruling elites cease to be a creative minority and turn into merely a dominant minority, then the civilization declines

#### Famous Quote

- **Suicide vs Murder**: He said very poetically that civilizations die by suicide, not murder - meaning due to internal factors, not due to external aggression

#### Role of Ruling Elites

- **Crucial Role**: The ruling elites of the society play a very crucial role in determining the future of a civilization

#### Predictions

- **Western Civilization**: According to him, the West is not in a stage of decline. The Western leadership, the ruling elites in the West are offering those creative solutions which keeps the civilization thriving and alive and kicking
- **Future Prediction**: He predicted that perhaps in the near to medium term we will witness the Hindu civilization, the Far East civilization and the Islamic civilization merge into the Western civilization

#### Current Relevance

- **India's Status**: Are we becoming cheap American copies? We outsource everything, speak English, type, fix computers sitting here, all cheaply
- **Question**: What is your sense? If he seems to be wrong, do you think that perhaps Modi ji offers us that creative leadership which will keep the Hindu civilization alive and kicking?
- **Trend Reversal**: Has the trend of merging into Western civilization been reversed?
- **Declining Characteristics**: One characteristic of declining civilization which he identified - it keeps on harping over a glorious past

## Development and Dependency Theory (140:44)

### Historical Context

- **Emergence**: This theory emerged in the 1960s, first in Latin America
- **Origin**: United Nations Commission for Latin America (UNCLA)
- **Developers**: Some UNCLA scholars, economists came up with the dependency theory
- **Expansion**: Later, Latin American scholars were joined by scholars from other parts of the world like Asia, Africa

### Background: Modernization Theory

#### Context of Emergence

- **Decolonization**: Developed in the context of decolonization when colonialism came to an end
- **Challenge**: Newly freed nations were plagued by massive poverty, illiteracy, hunger, deprivation of all sorts
- **Question**: How do you ensure the material well-being of the large populations?

#### ROSTOW's Modernization Theory

- **Solution Proposed**: They can meet these challenges by modernization
- **Modernization Definition**: Adopting features of modern society that emerged in Western Europe after French and Industrial Revolution

##### Features of Modern Society

- Industrial economy
- Nuclear family
- Scientific temperament, rationality instead of religion
- Urban living rather than rural living
- Mass education

#### Modernization Path

- **Current State**: At independence, most ex-colonies were pre-modern and traditional
- **Problem**: Their traditional social structures were preventing their growth and development, holding them back
- **Solution**: If societies want to experience rapid economic growth and prosperity, they should give up their traditional structures and values and adopt modern ones

##### Specific Changes Required

- Shift from agrarian economy to industrial economy
- From restricted education to mass education  
- From other political systems to liberal democratic political systems
- Give up caste, replace it with class as form of stratification
- Shift from joint family system to nuclear family system
- Get out of religion, meaningless rituals and superstitions, move towards rationality and scientific temper
- Adopt all features in modern Western societies

#### Why This Path Would Work

- **Tried and Tested**: It's a tried and tested model
- **Western Experience**: Earlier Western societies were also like this pre-modern. They have traveled through this path already
- **Advantage**: You don't have to reinvent the wheel. Technology is available in the West
- **Solution**: Simply import it from the West
- **Western Help**: The West will have to help the third world countries with technology and capital, because their technology is pre-modern and level of capital formation is very low

#### Did India Follow This Path?

- **Nehru's Approach**: Nehru was a committed modernizer. Nehru and the Nehru state was committed to promotion of scientific temper, mass-based education, technological modernization
- **Foreign Policy**: We didn't tie our destinies entirely with the West, maintained a stance of non-alignment to benefit from both Eastern and Western aid
- **Role of Western Aid**: Western financial aid, technology transport did play an important role in our developmental journey even during Nehru period, not just post-reforms

#### Results

- **Question**: Have we achieved the levels of prosperity that the West has achieved as was projected by the modernization theory?
- **Answer**: Clearly not
- **Realization**: This realization that the modernization approach perhaps is not in the best interest of the third world countries was expressed academically in the form of the dependency theory

### Dependency Theory: Core Arguments

#### Basic Premise

- **Impossibility**: Third world countries cannot become prosperous by following the Western model and by integrating their economies, tying their economic destinies with Western countries and depending on the West for aid (technological and financial)

#### Why They Cannot Become Prosperous

- **Unequal Relationship**: The third world countries are in an unequal and exploitative relationship with the first world countries
- **Terminology**: 
  - First World = developed West
  - Second World = Eastern bloc (during Cold War)
  - Third World = poor countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America (including Nigeria and India)

#### Global Economic System Structure

- **Single System**: There is a single integrated global economy
- **Core-Periphery Model**:
  - **Core**: Rich countries (first world countries) constitute the core of global economy
  - **Periphery**: Third world countries are at the periphery of global economy
- **Alternative Terminology**: 
  - **Metro-Satellite**: First world countries are the metros while third world countries are the satellites

#### Economic Exchange Pattern

**From Periphery to Core (Third World to First World)**:

- Cheap labor
- Cheap raw materials  
- Virgin markets or untapped markets

**From Core to Periphery (First World to Third World)**:

- Finished goods
- Obsolete/outdated technology
- Financial aid (but tied aid with conditionalities)

#### Problem with This Exchange

- **Higher Margins**: They supply finished goods, we supply raw materials (they sell our stuff back to us after polishing it slightly)
- **Dependency Creation**: 
  - Technologically dependent on first world
  - Capital dependent on first world  
- **Result**: Global haves and global have-nots

### Historical Continuity

- **Colonial Period**: During colonialism, this dependency relationship and unequal economic relationship was very apparent
- **Earlier Recognition**: DADABHAI NAOROJI outlined an earliest version in his notion of "Drain of Wealth"
- **Post-Colonial**: The state of dependency has been perpetuated even after the formal end of colonialism through other ways

### Core-Periphery Dynamics

**Diagrammatic Representation**:

- Core of rich countries
- Periphery of third world countries
- **Flow Patterns**:
  - Core to Periphery: Finished goods, capital (tied aid), obsolete technology
  - Periphery to Core: Raw materials, labor, markets (access to markets)

#### Semi-Periphery Concept

- **Definition**: Countries which serve as periphery to the core countries and as core to the periphery countries
- **Examples**: BRICS countries (Brazil, India, China) are in the stage of semi-periphery
- **Function**: We exploit (get cheap labor, virgin markets from poorer African countries) and in turn provide cheap labor to first world countries

### Key Dependency Theorists

#### Latin American Scholars

- **RAOL PREBISCH**
- **ANIBAL PINTO** 
- **CELSO FURTADO**
- Many were members of UNCLA (creators of dependency theory)

#### Other Scholars

- **SAMIR AMIN** (Egyptian-French scholar)
- **HAMZA ALAVI** (from Pakistan)

#### ANDRE GUNDER FRANK

- **Background**: German-American scholar whose primary area of interest was development in Latin America
- **Important Theory**: "Development of Underdevelopment"
- **Exam Relevance**: Important because this work has been asked by name in exams

### ANDRE GUNDER FRANK's "Development of Underdevelopment"

#### Key Distinction

- **Undeveloped vs Underdeveloped**: Third world countries are not just undeveloped, they are underdeveloped. There is a difference.

#### Historical Analysis

- **Pre-Colonial Period**: The regions which were later colonized, before colonialism those regions were undeveloped
- **Definition of Undeveloped**: Their resources were not fully utilized, so they did not reach the level of economic prosperity they could have

#### Colonial Impact

- **During and After Colonialism**: These regions have become underdeveloped
- **Parallel Development**: The colonizer nations have become developed

#### Central Thesis

- **Two Sides of Same Coin**: Development and underdevelopment are two sides of the same coin
- **Causal Relationship**: The European countries have become developed because of the underdevelopment of the third world countries
- **Wealth Transfer**: Their resources, their wealth has been extracted and transferred to the first world countries
- **Conclusion**: The wealth of the first world is an outcome of the underdevelopment of the third world. Underdevelopment of the third world has resulted in the development of the first world

### IMMANUEL WALLERSTEIN's World System Theory

#### Background

- **Nationality**: American scholar
- **Version**: Given a version of dependency theory called World System Theory

#### Core Argument

- **Single World**: There are no three worlds. There is a single integrated world economy
- **Different Positions**: Different countries occupy different positions in the single integrated global economy
- **Structure**: 
  - Rich countries are at the core
  - Poor countries (so-called third world countries) are at the periphery

#### Dynamic Nature

- **Change**: The position of countries does change, but very slowly/gradually
- **Historical Examples**:
  - **Colonial Peak**: European colonizers (France, UK, Portugal) were at the core
  - **Today**: America is at the core of global economy
  - **Future**: In some decades maybe China will be in the core
