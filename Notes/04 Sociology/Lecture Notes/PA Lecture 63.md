# Dalit Movements in Contemporary Times

## Introduction to Contemporary Dalit Movement (01:47)

- This lecture continues from the previous discussion on **AMBEDKAR** and **GANDHI'S** views on caste
- **GANDHI** on caste and untouchability used the term **Harijan** and spoke of **Hridaya Parivartan** (change of heart)

- **AMBEDKAR** argued that caste has to be removed and questioned the mechanism of caste
- **AMBEDKAR** proposed striking at the roots of the problem - the Hindu scriptures

## Analysis of Contemporary Dalit Movement (25:15)

### **Key Characteristics of Modern Dalit Movement**

#### **Increasing Use of Militant Methods** (27:55)

- **Methods being used**: Bandh (shutdown), chakka jam (road blockade), giving calls for nation-wide bandh
- These methods are not new in Indian society and politics
- Earlier these methods were used by **dominant castes**, **farmer communities** (like **Jats**, **Patidars**)
- Now Dalits are also resorting to such militant methods for the first time

#### **Increasingly Confrontational Attitude** (29:57)

- Dalits are no longer willing to play second fiddle
- They are increasingly taking the higher castes head-on
- **Bhim Army's** attitude: "Ek marenge to do marenge" (If you hit one, we'll hit two)
- In **Una incident**, after Dalits were flogged for skinning cattle, organizers threw dead cattle in middle of **Ahmedabad** city as protest
- Message: "We refuse to carry out traditional occupation. You deal with your own dead cattle"
- Dalits are increasingly refusing to pursue their **traditional caste-based occupations**
- Willing to engage in violence (not gun violence, but physical confrontation)

#### **Increasing Use of Social Media** (33:02)

- **Social media** being used as platform by **Dalit intellectuals**, **Dalit writers**, **educated Dalit youth**
- Used to express themselves and the suppressed anguish of the community
- **Mainstream media** is dominated and controlled by **upper castes**
- Dalits do not get platform through conventional mainstream media
- Studies show that TV anchors, editors are largely **high caste** (whether leftist or rightist, Hindu or Muslim)
- **Social media power** being harnessed by Dalit movement in various ways:
  - Making videos viral (like **Una flogging** video was spread by Dalits to highlight atrocities)
  - **Mobilizing funds**
  - **Organizing rallies** and protests
  - **Awakening masses** by igniting passion and highlighting incidents of atrocities

#### **Emergence of New Leadership** (36:26)

- Conventional Dalit leadership represented by **Bahujan Samaj Party** and mainstream politicians like **RAMVILAS PASWAN** (now deceased) are **conspicuous by their absence**
- **New leadership** seems to have emerged:
  - **JIGNESH MEVANI** (led Gujarat Una protests)
  - **CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD RAVAN** (Bhim Army leader)
- These are **educated Dalit youth** with **roots in civil society**

#### **Use of Music** (39:02)

- Reliance on **music** as a tool for reaching masses
- **Punjab**: **Dalit Pop** trend (e.g., **GINNI MAHI** - female Punjabi singer with albums like "Fan Baba Sahib Di")
- **Maharashtra**: **Bhim Geet**
- **Tamil Nadu**: Bands like **Castless Collective**
- **Purpose**: 
  - Music is popular and easy to connect with
  - Reaching out to youth and masses, striking a chord with them
  - Carrying **Ambedkarite message** and teachings
  - Making them part of the movement
- **Glorification of Dalit identity** through songs
- Example: **GINNI MAHI's** song "**Danger Chamar**" - reclaiming the term used to tease her in college as a badge of honor

## Challenges Before the Dalit Movement (46:06)

### **Multiple Challenges Identified**

1. **Funding Issues** - Dalits not able to mobilize adequate financial resources

2. **Fear and Reluctance** - Many Dalits still fearful of retaliation by higher castes, reluctant to participate in movements for their rights

3. **Administrative Barriers** - Administration erects barriers regardless of which community is protesting

4. **Lack of Pan-India Appeal** - Movement hasn't achieved pan-India character, mostly remains in pockets

5. **Questioning of Merit** - Dalits' achievements still questioned on merit grounds

6. **Social Boycott Threats** - Fear of social boycott by those not participating in movements

### **Critical Analysis by GHANSHYAM SHAH** (49:01)

**GHANSHYAM SHAH** states that the **Dalit movement has reached an impasse**:

- **Leadership unclear about their goals**, **tactics**, and **unsure of their alliances**
- **Post-AMBEDKAR Dalit movement** has significantly **challenged oppression and exploitation**
- **But it has failed to show the way of transformation**
- Successfully highlighted atrocities but lacks clear agenda for societal change
- **Contradiction**: Ultimate goal is **casteless society** but leadership uses **caste identity** to mobilize community
- Question: How can we move towards casteless society if mobilizing on basis of caste identity?

### **Heterogeneity of Dalits** (53:04)

- **Dalits are not a homogeneous group**
- **More than 1000 castes**, many further sub-divided into sub-castes
- Castes are spread regionally - present in one area, not in another
- **Castes arranged hierarchically** among themselves
- **Practice of untouchability** exists among Dalit castes
- **Different levels of socio-economic development** - some more backward, others have benefited from modernization
- Protests often remain **localized** and **caste-specific**
- **Separate caste associations** exist
- **Challenge**: Forming a united front with such heterogeneity

### **Opposition and Atrocities** (55:14)

- As Dalits become more assertive, **oppression and atrocities also increase**
- **Worst oppressors** of Dalits are not Brahmins but **OBCs** (Other Backward Classes)
- Many **dominant castes** belong to **Shudra varna** or **OBC category**
- **Contradiction**: **KANSHI RAM** envisioned alliance between **OBCs** and **Dalits**
- **Ground reality**: At village level, **OBCs** are often the biggest enemies of Dalits

### **Rise of Hindutva** (57:07)

- **KANCHA ILAIAH SHEPHERD** identifies **rise of Hindutva** as major challenge

- **Hindutva ideology** seeks to **unite all Hindus across castes** socially and politically

- Theoretically, **Hindutva movement downplays significance of caste identity**

- **Problems with Hindutva for Dalits**:
1. **Organizational Issue**: **Hindutva organizations** (RSS, BJP) are **largely dominated by upper castes**

2. **Ideological Clash**: 
   
   - **Hindutva movement glorifies Hinduism** and celebrates Hindu identity and culture
   - **AMBEDKAR** considered **Hindu as the problem** - main reason for caste and untouchability
   - **Fundamental contradiction** between Ambedkarite and Hindutva ideologies

3. **Ground Level Conflicts**: 
   
   - **Una incident**: **Hindutva activists** (Gau Rakshaks) attacked Dalits
   - **Bhima Koregaon**: **Hindu nationalists** questioned Dalits' patriotism and loyalty

4. **Instrumental Use**: 
   
   - **Hindutva movement** recruiting Dalits as **foot soldiers** but not at top levels
   - **Top leadership** remains **upper caste**
   - **Foot soldiers** (who engage in violence) are often **Dalits**
   - Example: **Ram Mandir** foundation laid by a Dalit as symbolic gesture

### **Limited Impact of Neo-Buddhist Movement** (64:02)

- **AMBEDKAR's** conversion to **Buddhism** was his last political act and statement
- **1951**: Buddhists were **0.7%** of India's total population
- **2011**: Buddhists remained **0.7%** of India's population
- **Neo-Buddhist movement** has had **very limited impact**
- **90% of neo-Buddhists** are from **Maharashtra**
- Despite **AMBEDKAR's** detailed criticism of Hinduism, **Dalits are opting to mostly remain within the Hindu fold**

## Two Approaches to Study of Caste (66:42)

### **Attributional Approach** (67:19)

- **Focuses on identifying certain features or attributes** that define the caste system
- Example: **GHURYE** identified **six main features of caste**
- According to this approach, **caste system appears unique** and **clearly distinct from class-based stratification** because of its unique attributes
- **Caste appears as rigid, birth-based and closed stratification system**
- Views caste as somewhat **static**, **fixed**, **closed endogamous groups**

### **Interactional Approach** (73:44)

- **Focuses on interactions that take place between castes**
- **Highlights the dynamics of caste relations** and **changes in the caste system**
- Takes greater cognizance of **dynamic aspects of caste**
- Nature of interactions may change as social situation changes
- Example: **M.N. SRINIVAS** concepts of **Sanskritization** and **Dominant Caste**
- **BERREMAN's** analysis of relationship between **caste, class and power**
- **Interactional approaches see caste as flexible and ever-evolving**
- **Emphasizes that wealth and power significantly shape inter-caste relations**

## DIPANKAR GUPTA's Views on Caste (85:47)

### **Critique of Hierarchy Thesis** (87:01)

**DIPANKAR GUPTA** in his book **"Interrogating Caste"** argues that:

- **Notion of hierarchy in caste system is over-emphasized**
- **Hierarchy thesis** was mainly developed by scholars like **LOUIS DUMONT**
- **DUMONT** considers that caste system arranges Hindus hierarchically on basis of **ritual purity**
- In this view, **ritual purity is salient**, while **wealth and power are secondary**
- Traditional view: **ritually pure Brahmins at top**, **polluting untouchables at bottom**

### **GUPTA's Alternative Understanding** (88:25)

**GUPTA** considers **DUMONT's** understanding of caste as:

- **Book view** and **far removed from ground reality**
- **Single pan-India hierarchy** is the **sacerdotal view** (priestly view)

**GUPTA's** main arguments:

#### **Multiple Hierarchies** (89:17)

- **There is no single caste hierarchy** to which all castes across India agree upon
- **There are multiple hierarchies** - probably **as many caste hierarchies as there are castes in India**
- **Every caste has its own version of hierarchy** in which it places itself at a respectable position

#### **No Caste Accepts Low Status** (90:03)

- **No caste, including lowest of castes, meekly accepts the lowly position** assigned to it by high castes
- **All castes tend to glorify their origins, histories, their past**
- **All castes claim to possess wonderful attributes and exceptional qualities**
- **All castes have caste pride**, including the low castes
- **No caste is immune to ridicule and mockery**, including highest and most powerful castes

#### **Examples of Inter-Caste Mockery** (92:01)

**Banias** (despite wealth):

- Mocked for being miserly, cowardly
- But **Banias** see themselves as wise with money, honest in dealings, descendants of **Raja Agrasen** (Suryavanshi), actually Kshatriyas

**Brahmins**:

- In **Western UP**: **Jats** say "Inko padne mein bhi ek kahawat aur inko marne mein bhi dawat" (Need invitation for both birth and death - always wanting free meals)
- In **Punjab**: Called "**Ponga Pandit**" (hollow/empty-headed)
- Some **Brahmins** in **Kerala** considered inauspicious - if seen, considered **dwar of evil**

**Rajputs**:

- Mocked: "Ladai karne dur jave veer raja, Rajput to peeche se Rani kaise jame veerput" (When Rajput men go away fighting wars, how do Rajputani women bear children - implying infidelity)

**Jats**:

- "**Jat re jat 16 duni aath**" (Jats think 16 x 2 = 8, implying they're thick-headed)
- "**Jat ki akal kahaan hoti hai, ghutne mein**" (Jat's intelligence is in their knees)

But **Jats** see themselves as:

- "**Jatni kabhi vidhwa nahin hoti**" (Jat women never become dependent widows)
- "**Hukka aur khaat, Jaton ki thaat**" (Hookah and cot are symbols of Jat pride)
- Originated from **Shivji ki jataon se** (Lord Shiva's hair locks)

#### **All Castes Claim Divine/Royal Origins** (104:17)

Examples of origin claims:

- **Jats**: From **Lord Shiva's** hair locks
- **Yadavs**: **Yaduvanshi** descendants of **Lord Krishna**
- **Kushwahas**: Descendants of **Kush** (son of **Lord Rama**)
- **Pasis**: From **Bhagwan Parshuram's** sweat
- **Chamars**: Originally **Brahmins** - story of three Brahmin brothers, one was tricked into removing dead cow and degraded
- **Mochis**: Part of **Shivaji's army**, had to hide and take up shoe-making
- **Vishwakarma**: Descendants of divine architect

### **GUPTA's Core Arguments** (108:20)

1. **Caste exists as discrete units**
2. While **conventional scholarship has emphasized hierarchy**, **GUPTA** considers **hierarchies are multiple and muddled**
3. **Far more important aspect** of caste system is **difference between castes**
4. **Each caste has its own values, customs, deities, and lifestyle** which it seeks to maintain
5. **Members of every caste perform caste-specific rituals** and **worship caste-specific deities**
6. **All castes, including lower castes, practice and justify endogamy**
7. **Castes refrain from merging with each other**
8. **There is no caste which is not proud of its legacy, beliefs and practices**

### **Historical Evidence Supporting GUPTA** (116:18)

- **Through history there have been innumerable caste revolts** and **instances of caste mobility**
- **Emergence of Rajput and Gujjar Pratihar kingdoms** in medieval period
- **Rise of Jats** in 13th century
- **Assertion by Ezhavas** and **Mahars** in modern period
- **Evidence that people do not take their low caste status lying down**
- **Caste unrest all around clearly shows** that **Brahmanical view has few takers**

### **GUPTA Builds on DUMONT** (134:51)

- While **criticizing DUMONT's emphasis on hierarchy**, **GUPTA endorses and builds upon DUMONT's concept of repulsion between castes**
- **DUMONT** had highlighted **repulsion** as one of three features of caste
- **GUPTA** has built upon this concept, emphasizing **difference** being far more salient than hierarchy

| **Comparison Table: Traditional vs GUPTA's View** |
| ------------------------------------------------- |

| **Aspect**             | **Traditional View (DUMONT)**     | **GUPTA's View**                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Hierarchy**          | Single, clear pan-India hierarchy | Multiple, muddled hierarchies              |
| **Brahmins' Position** | Universally at top                | Questioned and mocked by many castes       |
| **Lower Castes**       | Accept lowly position             | Reject degradation, have caste pride       |
| **Key Feature**        | Hierarchy based on ritual purity  | Difference and separation between castes   |
| **Caste Acceptance**   | Passive acceptance of status      | Active assertion and claims of superiority |
| **Origin Stories**     | Fixed brahmanical narrative       | Every caste has elaborate origin myths     |
