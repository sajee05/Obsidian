# Urban Sociology - Early Urban Sociological Perspectives

## Introduction and Context of Urban Sociology (18:37)

- In the last lecture, the current status of Indian agriculture, farm laws, farmers' protests, and peasant movements were discussed
- Key problems faced by Indian farmers include:
  - Lack of irrigation facilities
  - Fragmentation of agricultural land (average operational land holding size is 1.1 hectares)
  - 85% of India's agricultural households are small and marginal, owning less than two hectares of land
  - Role of intermediaries taking much of the farmers' profits
  - Feminization of agriculture resulting in dual burden on women
  - High levels of indebtedness (50% of all households are in debt)
  - Low level of income (around â‚¹10,200 annually)
  - Monsoon dependence
  - Agricultural stagnation
  - Incomplete land reforms and inadequate irrigation facilities
  - Too many people concentrated in agriculture (55% of the total workforce)

## Importance of Urban Sociology in India (27:17)

- **Historical Context**: When studying rural sociology and villages, it was rightly identified that bulk of India's population lives in rural areas
- **Gandhi's Perspective**: Bapu had commented that "India lives in its villages"
- **Traditional Focus**: Indian sociology initially focused immensely on village studies

### Why Study Urban Areas?

- **Economic Contribution**: Most of the GDP contribution comes from urban areas
- **Population Shift**: Not just the elite living in urban areas - most people in urban areas are migrants from villages
- **Employment Opportunities**: Jobs are concentrated in urban areas

### Current Urban Population Statistics

- **As per 2011 census**: 31.16% of India's population resides in urban areas
- **Significance**: This represents roughly 40 crore people - a huge chunk of population
- **Secular Trend**: There is a continuous trend of urbanization with the proportion increasing year by year, decade by decade

### Future Projections

- **By 2035**: According to UN Habitat, 43% of India's population will be urban
- **By 2050**: It is estimated that 55% of India's population will be urban
- **Implication**: The majority of Indians will be living in urban areas, and bulk of GDP is generated in urban areas

## Western Origins of Urban Sociology (31:52)

- **Disciplinary Origin**: In the west, from the very beginning, the discipline of sociology was focused on the study of urban areas
- **Context of Emergence**: Sociology emerged in the context of large-scale industrialization, urbanization, and modernization

### Founding Fathers' Contributions

- **DURKHEIM**: Analyzed complex division of labor and organic solidarity
- **KARL MARX**: Engaged in the study of class conflict and alienation in industrial cities  
- **WEBER**: Focused on rationalization and bureaucratic organizations
- All extensively studied modern urban society

### Chicago School Contributions

- **Important Role**: Chicago school made significant contributions to urban studies
- **Key Scholars**: PARK, BURGESS, and others conducted important urban studies

## Early Sociology in India (35:31)

### Establishment of Sociology in India

- **First Department**: Established in 1919 at University of Bombay by **PATRICK GEDDES**
- **Geddes' Work**: He compiled town planning reports for about 18 cities
- **Limited Impact**: Despite establishing the first department, Geddes had limited impact due to very small student enrollment
- **GHURYE's Role**: The discipline began to flourish when GHURYE took over the reigns in early 1920s

### Academic Focus During Formative Years

- **1950s and 1960s**: Indian sociology was focused on village studies and rural areas
- **Consequence**: There was consequential neglect of urban studies during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s
- **Academic Neglect**: Urban areas suffered from academic neglect during this period

## History of Urbanization in India (40:48)

### Modernization Theory Perspective

- **Basic Premise**: According to modernization theorists, large-scale urbanization is a direct consequence or outcome of industrialization
- **Western Template**: This understanding is based primarily on the European American broadly western experience

### Critique of Western Model

- **Scholars' Critique**: **M.S.A. RAO** in his book **"Urban Sociology in India"** and **RAMACHANDRAN** in his book **"Urbanization and Urban Systems in India"** point out that this western view is very limiting

| Mughal Period         | More than 120 big cities and 3,000 towns                         | Delhi was bigger than Paris, Fatehpur Sikri bigger than London |

### Pre-Industrial Urbanization in India

- **Rich History**: India has had a much richer history of urbanization since thousands of years
- **Harappan Civilization**: The first civilization in India was an urban civilization
- **Continuous Pattern**: Throughout Indian history, there have been periods of urban flourish and periods of urban decline
- **Mughal Era**: During the Mughal period, there were more than 120 big cities and more than 3,000 towns across India

### Factors Leading to Pre-Industrial Urbanization

1. **Trade and Commerce**: Cities like Muradabad, Surat, Ujjain, Lothal served as trading and commercial hubs
2. **Religious Significance**: Places like Haridwar, Prayag, Kashi, Mathura, Ayodhya, Bodh Gaya emerged due to pilgrimage
3. **Administrative/Political Centers**: Ruling elites established their headquarters, making them urban centers
4. **Educational Centers**: Cities emerged as education centers like Nalanda, Taxila, Vikramshila

## Colonial Period Urbanization (52:39)

### British Contributions to Urbanization

- **Port Towns**: Establishment of port towns like Madras and Kolkata
- **Hill Stations**: Development of hill stations like Shimla, Dalhousie, Darjeeling for summer retreats
- **Railway System**: Establishment of railways contributed immensely to urbanization by facilitating large-scale movement of people
- **Municipal Governance**: British laid foundations of modern municipal governance
  - **Father of Municipal Governance**: LORD RIPON played an important role
- **Administrative Areas**: Establishment of cantonment areas and civil lines for civil officials and military
- **Modern Industry**: Beginning of modern industry during colonial period including:
  - Textile mills in Surat and Bombay
  - Jute mills in Dhaka
  - Leather factories in Kanpur
  - Steel mill in Jamshedpur

## Post-Independence Urbanization (55:19)

### Factors Contributing to Urbanization After Independence

1. **Industrialization**: 
   
   - The Nehruvian state was committed to large-scale rapid industrialization
   - Industrial towns established: Bhilai, Durgapur, Rourkela, Faridabad, Noida, Ghaziabad

2. **Education**: 
   
   - Spread of education created educational hubs attracting student population
   - Examples: Pune, Delhi, Kota

3. **Administrative Reasons**: 
   
   - New districts and states carved out with new capitals
   - Example: Andhra Pradesh (later changed)
   - District headquarters creation also results in urbanization

4. **Partition**: 
   
   - Large-scale influx of population immediately with independence
   - Population exchange accompanying partition
   - Establishment of refugee camps and colonies, including areas like Rajendra Nagar (originally a refugee colony)

5. **Globalization**: 
   
   - Government promoting industrial parks, special economic zones, industrial corridors
   - International financial cities like GIFT (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City)

## Definition of Urban Areas (59:48)

### Census Definition

#### Two Types of Towns According to Census of India:

1. **Census Towns** - Must meet three criteria:
   
   - Minimum population of 5,000 persons
   - Minimum population density of 400 persons per square kilometer  
   - At least 75% of the male working population engaged in non-agricultural activities

2. **Statutory Towns** - Those declared by statute or law, including:
   
   - Municipality
   - Municipal Corporation
   - Cantonment Board

### Urban Statistics in India

- **Total Villages**: 6 lakh plus villages in India
- **Total Towns**: About 8,000 towns (combination of census and statutory towns)
- **Population Distribution**: About 2/3 population (around 80 crore people) resides in 6 lakh plus villages, while about 1/3 resides in only 8,000 towns
- **Town Distribution**: Out of 8,000 towns, roughly half are census towns and roughly half are statutory towns

## Sociological Understanding of Urban vs Rural (65:38)

### Urban-Rural Dichotomy

- **Contrast Approach**: Urban is frequently understood in contrast to rural
- **Antithesis**: Urban society is the very opposite of rural society
- **Complete Difference**: A city is everything that the village is not - city life and village life are completely different

| Aspect               | Urban Areas                                                                        | Rural Areas                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Population           | Higher population size and density                                                 | Lower population size, sparsely populated                     |
| Economy              | Industries and services based (secondary and tertiary sector)                      | Agriculture and allied sectors (primary sector)               |
| Social Mobility      | Far more opportunities for social mobility                                         | Constrained by traditional identities and kinship ties        |
| Environment          | Concrete jungles, polluted, cut off from nature                                    | Closer to nature, less polluted                               |
| Infrastructure       | Better physical and social infrastructure (roads, electricity, hospitals, schools) | Mud huts, kacha roads, limited infrastructure                 |
| Population Character | More heterogeneous                                                                 | More homogeneous                                              |
| Technology           | Greater role of technology, dependent on technology                                | Less technological dependence                                 |
| Pace of Life         | Fast-paced, racing against time                                                    | Slower pace of life                                           |
| Social Relations     | Transactional, rule-based, impersonal, unemotional                                 | Personal relations, emotional bonds, strong community feeling |
| Social Structure     | Bureaucratic and rational                                                          | Greater community feeling                                     |

### Classical Sociological Concepts

#### FERDINAND TONNIES' Concepts:

- **Gemeinschaft**: Community - characterized by close-knit, face-to-face interaction, personal relations (associated with rural society)
- **Gesellschaft**: Society - characterized by rules-based impersonal relations, not regular face-to-face interaction (associated with urban society)

#### DURKHEIM's Solidarity Types:

- **Mechanical Solidarity**: Sense of oneness arising out of homogeneity or sameness (rural society)
- **Organic Solidarity**: Sense of unity arising out of interdependence (urban society)

## GEORG SIMMEL's Urban Analysis (80:07)

### "The Metropolis and Mental Life"

- **Core Argument**: Living in a bustling metropolis has significant psychological consequences for residents
- **Behavioral Impact**: People think and behave differently in cities than rural populations
- **Bundle of Contradictions**: A city is described as a bundle of contradictions

### Urban Life Characteristics According to SIMMEL:

#### Positive Aspects:

- **Liberating Experience**: City life frees individuals from clutches of tradition and traditional identities
- **Individual Freedom**: Less constrained by kinship, caste, ethnicity
- **Opportunities**: Provides opportunity for social mobility and personal development
- **Individualistic**: Allows people to "do their own thing"

#### Negative Aspects:

- **Sensory Bombardment**: Continuous bombardment with sounds and images through advertising, billboards
- **Selective Response**: City dwellers learn to be picky and respond selectively to stimuli
- **Psychological Defense**: People filter out or ignore most stimuli to avoid going crazy
- **Impersonal Behavior**: Results in becoming impersonal, detached, cold, rational

### SIMMEL's Conclusion:

- **Head vs Heart**: In the city, people use their head instead of their heart
- **Dual Nature**: Though the city provides a liberating environment allowing freedom from traditional social structures and customs, it also makes city dwellers too rational, cold, calculating, reserved, detached, and indifferent

## LOUIS WIRTH's Urbanism (92:36)

### "Urbanism as a Way of Life"

#### Distinction Between Concepts:

- **Urbanism**: Thinking pattern and behavior pattern specific to city dwellers due to living in cities with large population and density
- **Urbanization**: Process of movement of people from villages to towns and cities, causing both population and spatial boundaries of cities to grow

### WIRTH's Definition of Urbanism:

- **Urbanism**: Refers to the patterns of behavior, relationships, and mode of living that characterize city dwellers

### Factors Influencing Urban Life Pattern:

Cities have a distinct pattern of living because of:

1. **Large Population**
2. **High Population Density** 
3. **Heterogeneity**

### Characteristics of Urbanism:

- **Impersonal Relations**
- **Transactional Outlook**
- **Rational Attitude**

## Critique of Rural-Urban Dichotomy (98:50)

### Reality of Rural-Urban Interconnection

- **Not Polar Opposites**: Rural areas and urban areas are not poles apart
- **Close Contact**: They are in close contact with each other with regular daily movement
- **Population Origins**: Most city populations are migrants from villages themselves
- **Infrastructure Development**: Villages are getting factories, resulting in urbanization
- **Daily Commute**: Villagers travel daily to nearby cities for jobs

### ROBERT REDFIELD's Folk-Urban Continuum (103:05)

#### Concept Development:

- **Study Location**: Developed based on study in Mexico, specifically Tapospalan village
- **Book**: "The Folk Culture of Yucatan"
- **Applicability**: Though developed for Mexico, widely applicable to developing societies like India

#### Folk-Urban Continuum Characteristics:

| Aspect              | Folk Society (Rural)                        | Urban Society                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Definition          | Shorthand for rural society                 | Modern urban centers         |
| Characteristics     | Traditional, homogeneous                    | Modern, heterogeneous        |
| Population Exchange | Continuous exchange between rural and urban | Regular contact and movement |

### REDFIELD's Key Arguments:

- **Developing Societies**: In developing societies, rural and urban areas are not in complete opposition to each other
- **Better Representation**: The continuum better captures the social reality in developing societies
- **Continuous Exchange**: There is continuous exchange and regular contact between rural and urban areas
- **Limitation of Dichotomy**: The notion of rural-urban dichotomy does not correctly capture the strong interlinkages between rural and urban societies

### Examples of Rural-Urban Linkages:

#### **M.N. SRINIVAS' Observations**:

- Cities and villages in India are elements of the same civilization
- Many city dwellers leave their families back in the village
- Many people maintain residence in village but travel regularly to nearby cities for livelihood
- Many villagers reside in close proximity to bustling city centers
- Well-developed network of railways and roadways connect lakhs of villages with towns and cities
- Villagers are well informed about developments in the city through TV, radio, newspapers

#### Contemporary Examples:

- **Urban Elements in Villages**: Villages today have bikes, mobile phones, people wear shirts and pants instead of traditional dhotis
- **Students and Education**: University campuses in rural areas bring urban populations, leading to development of clubs, cafes, and urban amenities
- **Cultural Exchange**: Youth from villages visit malls in nearby cities, bringing back urban cultural elements like fashion, dating practices

## Little Tradition and Great Tradition (129:11)

### ROBERT REDFIELD's Additional Concepts

- **Essay Source**: "Peasant Society and Culture"
- **Developed by**: Later elaborated by **MCKIM MARRIOTT**

### Definitions:

#### Little Tradition:

- **Components**: Local customs, social rites and rituals, local dialects, local folklore, local legends
- **Popularity**: Popular among rural masses
- **Transmission**: Elements are in oral form and spread informally
- **Popularizers**: Local storytellers, folk artists, local bards, fortune tellers, performers
- **Acceptance**: Uncritically accepted and followed by unlettered masses in rural areas

#### Great Tradition:

- **Components**: Complex philosophies, ancient scriptures, mythologies, great epics
- **Interpreters**: Interpreted by city-based thought leaders, preachers, philosophers
- **Transmission**: Elements are in written form and transmitted through formal mechanisms
- **Followers**: Followed by the literate and reflective few who apply detailed analysis and study

### Cultural Exchange Processes:

#### **MCKIM MARRIOTT's Concepts**:

1. **Parochialization**: 
   
   - Social process by which elements of great tradition are passed down to little tradition
   - Involves localization and reducing cultural elements to less reflective dimensions
   - Makes complex ideas easily understood by unlettered masses
   - **Example**: In Kishan Garh village (UP), KRISHNA as Govardhana (protector of cows) in Bhagavat Purana became Gobar-dhan puja (worship of cow dung) in local practice

2. **Universalization**:
   
   - Social process by which elements of little tradition are carried up and absorbed into great tradition
   - **Example**: Local goddess Saurti (made of mud, symbolizing wealth) in Kishan Garh village was incorporated as goddess LAKSHMI in great tradition of Hinduism

### Continuous Exchange:

- **Dynamic Process**: Little tradition and great tradition do not operate in isolation
- **Cultural Flow**: Continuous exchange of cultural elements between them through universalization and parochialization processes

## Contemporary Urban Studies in India (154:34)

### Persistence of Traditional Elements in Urban Areas

- **Research Findings**: Various studies in Indian cities have found that traditional social structures and identities have not been completely wiped out from urban social environment

### Examples of Traditional Structures in Urban Areas:

1. **Caste in Urban India**: 
   
   - Studies like IHDS surveys show prevalence of caste in urban areas
   - **HAROLD GOULD's Study**: Studied rickshaw pullers of Lucknow who were liberal in occupation (served customers irrespective of caste) but very caste-conscious in family/domestic sphere

2. **Joint Family**: 
   
   - Prevalence of joint family sentiment and functional (if not structural) jointness
   - **Study Reference**: "Family and Kinship: A Study of Pandits of Rural Kashmir" and similar urban studies

3. **Kinship Importance**: Continues to play significant role in urban social interactions

## Conclusion: Indian Cities - A Unique Character (157:41)

### Distinctive Nature of Indian Cities:

- **Not European/American**: Indian cities are not like European or American cities
- **Not Like Indian Villages**: They are also not like Indian villages

### Structural Continuities and Differences:

#### **Important Structural Continuities**:

- Traditional social structures like caste, kinship, joint family greatly affect social interaction in urban India as well

#### **Significant Differences**:

- Cities and villages have significant differences as well
- Traditional social structures, though present, are under strain in urban areas
- The sheer size and density of population in urban areas ensure that traditional structures have to adapt and operate differently in urban areas than they do in rural areas

### Final Assessment:

Indian urban sociology represents a unique blend where traditional and modern elements coexist, creating a distinctive urban character that cannot be understood through simple rural-urban dichotomies or western models of urbanization.
