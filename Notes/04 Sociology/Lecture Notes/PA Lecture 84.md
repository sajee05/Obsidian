# Lecture Notes: Political System, Regionalism and Secularism in India

## RELIGIOUS INTERACTIONS AND MINORITY ISSUES (07:07)

### Scholarly Critique of Islam

- **TOCQUEVILLE** stated that Islam is possibly the deadliest religion in the world
- **RICHARD DAWKINS** has been critical of religion in general, identifies Islam to be more oppressive for Muslim women and sisters
- **IBN WARRAQ** criticizes the life of Prophet Mohammad

### Impact of Hinduism on Muslims and Islam

- **Demographic changes** observed among Muslim communities
- **MOHSIN MADANI** and other scholars have noted adoption of Hindu cultural practices
- **PEW RESEARCH** findings: 77% of Muslims are believing in karma
- Studies show prevalence of **caste system** among South Asian Muslims, particularly studied by scholars like **M.K. SIDDIQUI** and **IMTIAZ AHMAD**
- Hindu social institutions found among South Asian Muslims

### Impact of Islam on Hinduism

- Large scale conversion of Hindus to Islam
- Monotheistic influences seen in reinterpretations of Hindu scriptures
- **CHARLES ELIOT** claims that figures like Madhav, Shankaracharya, and Ramanuja were influenced by Islam ‚≠ê (This claim by Charles Eliot is highly contested by mainstream scholarship as these figures predated significant Islamic influence in India)

## THE MINORITY QUESTION (19:08)

### Definition of Minorities

- **Sociologically**, minorities are identified not so much on the basis of numerical strength, but rather those social groups who suffer from marginalization and various discriminations are regarded as minorities

- **LOUIS WIRTH** defines a minority group as: "Any group of people who because of their physical and cultural characteristics are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination"

- The term minority is not so much a number thing - it is about discrimination and subordinate groups who experience discrimination and are relatively powerless compared to dominant groups in society

### Approaches to Deal with Minorities

| Approach               | Description                                                                          | Examples/Context                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extermination**      | Complete elimination                                                                 | Nazi Germany with Jews during Holocaust                          |
| **Disenfranchisement** | Removal of voting rights, relegation to second-class citizen status                  | SUBRAMANIAN SWAMY's suggestion regarding Muslims                 |
| **Expulsion**          | Forcing minorities to leave, preventing inward migration                             | "Pakistan jao" slogan, DONALD TRUMP's wall proposals             |
| **Assimilation**       | Absorption into mainstream culture, loss of distinctive identity                     | US melting pot approach, Uniform Civil Code proposals            |
| **Integration**        | Unity while allowing diverse identities to flourish                                  | Allowing cultural distinctiveness while promoting national unity |
| **Modernization**      | Organic process of becoming more modern, reducing emphasis on traditional identities | Different from imposed communist systems                         |

### Critiques of Various Approaches

**Problems with Extermination and Disenfranchisement:**

- Against basic human rights
- Too extreme approaches

**Problems with Expulsion:**

- Against humanitarian considerations
- People typically don't leave homelands out of choice but due to humanitarian crisis
- Goes against India's civilizational ethos of welcoming people from various parts of the world
- India has historically welcomed Tibetan refugees, Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, Bangladeshi refugees during 1971 war

**Problems with Assimilation:**

- Minorities have the right to preserve their culture and diversity
- Even after assimilation, minorities are often still seen as distinctive and discriminated against
- Loss of essential cultural essence

## POLITICAL SYSTEM OVERVIEW (46:47)

### Nature of Indian Political System

- **Structurally and procedurally**, India has adopted a **liberal multi-party democracy** of the Western type (similar to Britain and some elements of US-type polity)

- **In operation**, Indian democracy and polity is very different from that in the West and also very complex

### Complexity Factors in Indian Politics

- **Numerous ethnic identities** shape Indian politics and social life
- Indian social and political life is **rife with ethnic conflicts**, numerous ethnic conflicts, competing claims
- **Numerous pressure groups and political parties** with overlapping identities
- **Identity politics** is prevalent with various ethnic identities affecting political decisions and processes

### Salient Ethnic Identities in Indian Politics

| Identity Type          | Examples                                   | Political Significance                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Caste**              | Various caste groups                       | Major factor in political mobilization |
| **Religious Identity** | Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian communities | Significant political influence        |
| **Language**           | Regional linguistic groups                 | Basis for regional political parties   |
| **Tribal Identity**    | Various tribal communities                 | Important in certain regions           |
| **Class**              | Captured in some of the above categories   | Less prominent as independent factor   |

**Note on Gender:**

- Gender is undoubtedly a salient social identity but has not informed political life to as great an extent as other factors
- Never been much of a political axis of mobilization
- No women-based political parties exist in India
- Recently started by BJP with outreach to women through women's reservation

### Overlapping Identities Concept

- Individuals don't have single identity - multiple identities exist simultaneously
- Example: A person can be Baniya (caste), Hindu (religion), belonging to certain class and linguistic identity
- Which identity becomes more salient depends on changing demands of prevailing socio-political situation
- This is why we see "overlapping identities"

### Ethno-Nationalist Movements in India

**Definition of Ethnic Group:**

- A group of people who identify with each other due to some shared element of culture such as language or religion
- Members believe they have shared history, shared customs and descent from common ancestors

**Types of Nations:**

- **Civic Nations**: Based on common legal and constitutional framework, single citizenship
- **Ethnic Nations**: Based on common culture and common ethnicity
- European nations were ethnic nations; India is a civic nation due to multiple ethnicities and cultures

**Examples of Ethno-Nationalist Movements:**

- **HINDUTVA ideology**: Example of ethno-nationalism according to which Indian nation comprises those who share common heritage, common civilizational heritage, belonging to same culture with common ancestors
- **VEER SAVARKAR's definition**: "A Hindu is he who considers Bharatvarsha as their Pitribhumi (land of ancestors) and Punyabhumi (holy land)"
- **Dravidian Movement**: Led by PERIYAR, demanded separate homeland for Dravidian states based on common culture
- **Pakistan Movement**: Based on religious identity
- **Khalistan Movement**: Sikh separatist movement

### Ethnic Conflicts and Cleansing

Examples include:

- Cleansing of Tamils in Sri Lanka
- Kashmiri Pandits from Kashmir
- Jews in Germany during Holocaust
- Conflicts between different ethnic groups, caste-based conflicts, communal conflicts
- Conflicts between tribals and non-tribals
- Conflicts between linguistic groups

### CHRISTOPHE JAFFRELOT's Analysis

**CHRISTOPHE JAFFRELOT** states that under BJP, India has developed a new form of democracy - **ethnic democracy**

- India has become an ethnic democracy under Hindutva rule
- The majority community is equated with the nation
- The ethnic majority (Hindus) has also become a permanent political majority
- This results in **majoritarianism**
- Hindutva ideology has captured not only political power but also society

## REGIONALISM IN INDIAN POLITICS (66:34)

### Definition of Regionalism

**Regionalism** refers to the emergence and growth of a strong sense of identification, attachment and loyalty to a particular region and territory.

Regional consciousness emerges among people in a given territory because of some shared element of culture such as:

- **Language** (most important in Indian context)
- **Religious identity** 
- **Tribal identity**

### Examples of Regional Identity Basis

| Region                   | Basis of Regional Identity      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Tamil Nadu**           | Language (Tamil)                |
| **Punjab**               | Language and religion (Sikhism) |
| **Bengal**               | Language (Bengali)              |
| **Jharkhand**            | Tribal identity                 |
| **Pakistan formation**   | Religion                        |
| **Bangladesh formation** | Language                        |
| **Bodo demand**          | Tribal/linguistic identity      |

### Scholarly Perspective on Linguistic Diversity

According to scholars like **PAUL BRASS** and **EDWARD SAPIR**:

- **Linguistic diversity has played a vital role in promoting regionalism in Indian polity**

### Manifestations of Regionalism

#### 1. Statehood Demands

- Started with demand for **Andhra Pradesh** as separate state for Telugu-speaking people
- **POTTI SRI RAMALU** sat on fast unto death demanding separate state for Telugu-speaking people
- Unlike Gandhi, Sri Ramalu actually died, leading to massive protests
- Central government was forced to relent
- This led to **States Reorganization Act 1956** largely based on linguistic identity
- Later formations: Haryana from Punjab, and in 21st century - Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, and later Telangana

#### 2. Secessionist Movements

- Those which demand separation from Indian Union
- Examples: **Khalistan movement**, **Dravidanadu movement**, **Greater Nagalim movement**

#### 3. Proliferation of Regional Political Parties

- India's political map is dotted with regional political parties
- Examples: PDP, National Conference (J&K), Akali Dal (Punjab), DMK, AIDMK, PMK (Tamil Nadu), TDP, TRS (Andhra Pradesh/Telangana), Asom Gana Parishad, TMC (Bengal)
- From early 1990s till 2014, regional parties played important role in central politics due to coalition governments

#### 4. Sons of the Soil Movements

- Combined with strong anti-migrant sentiment
- **SHIV SENA movement** in Maharashtra: "Maharashtra for Marathi Manoos"
- Initially targeted Tamilians and South Indians, later shifted focus to Biharis and migrants from UP and Bihar
- Argument that migrants are taking up jobs, educational opportunities, limited resources of society

#### 5. Interstate Disputes

- **Territory disputes**: Belgaum dispute between Maharashtra and Karnataka
- **Water resource disputes**: Cauvery water dispute between Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala

#### 6. Strained Interstate Relations

- Conflicts between state governments and center on various issues
- Wrongful imposition of Article 356 and President's rule
- Demanding more financial resources and aid from center
- Developmental packages

#### 7. Glorification of Regional Culture and Icons

- **Self-respect movement** led by **PERIYAR** in Tamil Nadu glorified Tamil culture, language, and identity
- Building big statue of Shivaji in Maharashtra (must be called Chhatrapati Shivaji)
- Demand for separate state flags (Karnataka, Jammu & Kashmir)

### Causative Factors of Regionalism

#### 1. Cultural Heterogeneity of India

- When you have so many languages, religions, and diversity, it is expected that people will develop strong sense of attachment to their own language, religion and ethnic identity

#### 2. Economic Backwardness and Regional Deprivation

- Sense that "our region is not prospering while collective resources in bigger state are being diverted for development of other regions"
- Examples: Vidarbha, Telangana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh
- These regions are resource-rich but economically backward because resources are being diverted for growth of other regions

#### 3. Unequal Participation in Political-Administrative Structure

- Combined Andhra example: People from Telangana not adequately represented in legislature, bureaucracy, various positions of power
- Argument: If we have our own legislature, separate administrative structure, then only people from our region will occupy those posts

#### 4. Political Aspirations of Regional Elites

- Regional leaders who could not become chief minister in combined state but can hope to become chief minister in separate state
- Example: **KCR** could not have become chief minister in combined Andhra but can in separate Telangana
- Economic elites also fund movements expecting benefits

#### 5. Local Geography

- Some regions may be very inaccessible, cut off from wider state and other regions
- This may inculcate sense of isolation and separateness

#### 6. History

- Not so long back, Indian polity was fractured into more than 500 princely states
- Different regions have had different political evolution historically

### Consequences and Impact of Regionalism

#### Negative Consequences

**JAWAHARLAL NEHRU** while addressing National Integration Council in 1961 cautioned against "evils like casteism, communalism and regionalism"

**GURU GOLWALKAR** also held parallel view and considered linguistic minorities as threat to national integration. Sub-national identities militate against national identity.

**Regionalism as Internal Security Threat:**

- Greater Nagaland movement, Khalistan movement are trying to break India from within
- Makes borders unsafe as enemy countries exploit secessionist tendencies within

**Other negative impacts:**

- Militates against development of national outlook
- Prevents development of national outlook
- Militates against constitutionally guaranteed freedoms (fundamental right to do business and take employment in any part of country)
- **Regionalism breeds separateness** and prevents psychological integration of people
- Article 370 argument: Because of separate constitutional status, Kashmiri people have not been able to become psychologically one with rest of India

**Critics' View:**

- If unchecked, can result in **balkanization of the country**
- Regionalism is threat to national security and internal security

#### Positive Perspective

**DR. MANMOHAN SINGH** while addressing National Integration Council in 2005 said:
"As a pluralistic society and polity, we have adequate space for regional and sub-regional identities and cultures. They are not necessarily inimical to our larger concept of nationhood. We must rejoice at the blossoming of regional identities and lay emphasis on harmony instead of unity."

**Benefits of Regionalism:**

- **Strengthens democracy**: Regional parties are able to better articulate aspirations and concerns of local people
- National parties are simply incapable of understanding local issues
- Regional parties take firm stand in interest of their region (example: Cauvery water dispute)
- Regional parties ensure effective development of region
- Some argue smaller states are better governed
- Can contribute to truer federal polity and competitive federalism
- Makes democracy more participatory, taking democracy closer to people in their language and in sync with their culture

**Key Point:** Nationalism and regionalism are not necessarily antithetical to each other. It can strengthen democratic processes, make it more participatory democracy.

**When Regionalism Becomes Problematic:**

- Only when it takes form of secessionist movements does regionalism seem to be threat to nation
- Statehood demands are not anti-national - each demand should be evaluated on its own merits

**GURU GOLWALKAR's Approach:**

- Secessionist movements in North East must be curbed with all might of Indian state
- Militarily crush secessionist movements and promote nationalism

## ROLE OF RELIGION IN INDIAN POLITICS (131:25)

### Understanding Indian Secularism vs Western Secularism

#### Origins and Context

**Western Secularism:**

- **French Revolution** resulted in separation of church and state
- Emerged as attempt by political leadership to resist interference by religious authorities in state affairs
- Context: Organized religion was playing important role in political affairs and political leadership was trying to resist church interference

**Indian Secularism:**

- Emerged in different socio-political context during **colonial period**
- Context: Colonial government was using policy of **divide and rule**
- National movement was trying to carry along different communities
- Ideology of secularism was developed by **national leadership** (Gandhi, Nehru, Azad) to challenge colonial state's policy of divide and rule and ideology of communalism
- Purpose: To unite different religious communities in anti-colonial struggle

#### Key Differences

| Aspect                 | Western Secularism                                  | Indian Secularism                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Separation Model**   | Clear wall of separation between religion and state | Wall of separation with one-way window                                   |
| **State Intervention** | State cannot interfere in religious affairs         | State can interfere in religious affairs                                 |
| **Public Expression**  | Religion banished from public sphere                | Religion very much present in public sphere                              |
| **Examples**           | France bans religious symbols in public             | India allows public celebration of religious identity by all communities |

### Indian Secularism Definitions

**THOMAS PANTHAM** states:

- **West emphasizes clear separation of state and religion**
- **Indian secularism emphasizes equal tolerance of all religions**

**Hindi Constitutional Version:**

- **Panthnirpekshata** = Panth (sect/religious community) + Nirpekshata (neutrality)
- **State neutrality in matters of religion**

**Better Understanding:**

- **Sarva Dharma Sambhava** = An attitude of equal respect for all religions

**RAJIV BHARGAVA** states:

- Indian state **maintains principled distance from religion**
- Indian state has **critical respect for all religions**
- **Critical respect**: Respectful but not blind adulation; wherever required to secure rights of disadvantaged sections, state advises and even initiates reforms

### Why India Chose Secularism

#### 1. Demographic Reality

- India has very large substantial non-Hindu population (20% = approximately 25 crore people)
- 20 crore Muslims in this country which cannot be wished away

#### 2. Nature of Majority Religion

- As scholars like **M.N. SRINIVAS**, **SHASHI THAROOR**, **RADHAKRISHNAN** have noted
- **Hinduism is diverse, pluralistic, inclusive and tolerant in character**

#### 3. Civilizational Ethos

- Numerous religious communities, different faiths, different belief systems have co-existed for centuries and millennia in India
- **Indian civilizational ethos cherishes mutual respect and peaceful co-existence**

#### 4. National Leadership

- **National leadership at time of independence was decidedly secular in outlook**
- Nehru was a **committed modernizer** - focused on spread of modern education, scientific temperament, rational thinking to ensure economic growth and national development

#### 5. Popular Support

- People at large also subscribe to secular outlook
- According to **PEW RESEARCH survey**: **84% of all Indians believe that respecting all religions is important for being truly Indian**

### Critique of Nehru Secularism

**Scholars like ASHISH NANDY, T.N. MADAN, PARTHA CHATTERJEE** criticize Nehruvian secularism:

**Main Criticisms:**

- **Secularism in India has been mostly a top-down project**
- National leadership came from very elite stratum of society - Western educated, highly privileged section
- They were themselves secular in Western sense, subscribed to Western values
- **NEHRU personally was almost an atheist**
- They expected Indian people will also become like them

**Core Problem:**

- **Fails to take into account that India is a deeply religious society**
- Ordinary people of India are not those westernized, highly educated types
- **For them religion matters and it matters greatly - there is nothing more important to Indian people than religion**
- Not practical to expect that in society where religion is so central, it can be sidelined from public affairs

**Supporting Data:**

- According to PEW RESEARCH survey: **97% Indians believe in God**
- **79% are absolutely certain that God exists**

**T.N. MADAN's Assessment:**

- **"Indian secularism is a social myth of the ruling elites"**
- **"It is impossible because most people are active adherents of a faith"**
- **"The elites who are a minority want to fashion the society in their own image, ignoring the immenseness of religion in people's lives"**

**Political Impact:**

- National leadership did not have sufficient appreciation of centrality of religion in people's lives
- This is what BJP has captured - when Modi pays respects at Krishna Janmabhoomi, it gives satisfaction to inner Hindu identity
- Nehru was never seen doing such religious acts
- This is why Nehru secular ideology is seeding space and losing out to Hindutva ideology
