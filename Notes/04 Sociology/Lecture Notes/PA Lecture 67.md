# Contemporary Women's Movements Issues and Kinship Systems in Indian Society

## SURROGACY (32:08)

- **Surrogacy**: A method and practice in which a woman undertakes to give birth to a child for another couple and agrees to hand over the child to them after birth
- The woman who nurtures the child in womb is known as **surrogate**
- The couple who will have rights over the child after its birth are known as **commissioning couple** or **intending parents**

### Types of Surrogacy

**Two main types exist:**

1. **Altruistic Surrogacy**: No payment is made to the surrogate except for medical expenses and insurance payments. The surrogate is not incentivized monetarily.

2. **Commercial Surrogacy**: The surrogate mother is paid an amount for undertaking the surrogacy.

### Legal Framework in India

- **The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act 2021** has been passed by Indian government
- This act **imposes a ban on commercial surrogacy** and **allows and regulates altruistic surrogacy**
- The act lays down various conditions under which one can have a surrogacy arrangement:
  - Intending parents should be married for first five years
  - They should be suffering from proven infertility
  - They should be of a certain age bracket
  - Surrogate should be in a certain age bracket
  - Surrogate should be ever married and should have a child of her own
  - A person can become a surrogate only once in her lifetime

### Regulatory Bodies

- The act provides for establishment of **National Surrogacy Board** and **State Level Surrogacy Boards**
- The act declares as offenses: commercial surrogacy, selling of embryos, abandoning surrogate child - all these are punishable offenses under the act
- The act also prohibits foreign couples from availing surrogacy services in India

### Global Context

- Surrogacy is a multi-billion dollar industry globally
- India in the past decade has emerged as a veritable hub of surrogacy
- There are a lot of ethical, medical, social issues associated with this very complex subject of surrogacy

### Sociological Analysis of Surrogacy

**The act seeks to balance the interests of various stakeholders, most importantly the interests and concerns of the unborn child and the surrogate mother.**

#### Arguments Supporting the Ban

- **Commercial surrogacy was premised upon two things: poverty and patriarchy**
- Survey by Ministry of Women and Child Development found that in Delhi and Bombay, more than **70% of the surrogates were housemaids**
- This indicates a **clear class dimension to surrogacy** - poor women are compelled to allow commercial exploitation of their wombs and bodies
- **National Commission for Women** highlighted that several young girls are being trafficked to be used as surrogates

#### Feminist Perspectives

**RAYMOND** argues that surrogacy:

- **Reinforces the subordination of women and makes them reproductive objects**
- **Surrogacy is a manifestation of patriarchal capitalism**
- Poor women's bodies are being commodified and exploited for commercial gain
- Poor women in developing countries like India become **reproductive slaves of first world couples**

**SUROJENA AND DAS** argue that **the surrogate is reduced to a reproductive machine**

### Ethical Concerns

- Should a child born out of surrogacy have the right to know and have a life long relationship with the mother who has given him birth?
- Should the surrogate mother have any rights over the child or not?
- There are multiple complexities involved when emotional bonds develop between surrogate and child

### Critical Perspectives on the Act

**Arguments against the ban:**

- This expectation of altruistic surrogacy is unrealistic in today's day and age where everything is commercial
- In altruistic surrogacy, doctors and hospitals still get paid, commissioning parents get what they want (the child), only the surrogate mother is expected to deliver a child in a spirit of altruism
- **AMRITA PANDE** says that the surrogate is not necessarily compelled or forced - she is an active agent who makes a conscious choice
- The money that one gets from surrogacy can be empowering for the surrogate

**DEVDUTT PATTANAIK** points out:

- Surrogacy type arrangements are not alien to Indian culture
- In Indian mythology and folklore, you will find numerous instances of artificial reproduction
- Several characters in mythology were born due to boons or magic potions given by rishis
- Indian society and culture is quite adept at making a distinction between a biological mother and a social mother (like Devaki and Yashoda)

## TRIPLE TALAQ (63:49)

- **Triple talaq**: The practice where a Muslim man uttering "talaq talaq talaq" results in a divorce with his wife
- **Instantaneous triple talaq** has now been declared unconstitutional and legally prohibited in India

### Historical Context

- Under the **Muslim Personal Law Sharia Application Act 1937**, triple talaq was a legally permissible type of divorce
- It was not preferred and encouraged, but it was a legally permissible form of divorce
- Before this act, it was unregulated and a grey area legally

### Legal Changes

- Few years back, first the **Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional**
- Then **Parliament enacted legislation** to follow it up
- The ban on triple talaq has been widely regarded as a welcome development

### Arguments Supporting the Ban

#### Constitutional Grounds

- **Indian Constitution guarantees equality, including gender equality**
- This prohibition is in sync with the constitutional promise of equality
- It is a further step towards ensuring **gender justice**

#### Community Support

- There was a **demand for abolition of instantaneous triple talaq from within the Muslim community**
- **Indian Muslim women were strongly in favor of prohibiting instant triple talaq**
- In 2015, a survey was conducted by **Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan** - **92% of Indian Muslim women** as per this survey were in favor of banning instant triple talaq

#### Religious Scholars' Views

- **JAKIA SOMAN** points out that **triple talaq has been banned in several Islamic countries** like Turkey, Egypt, Cyprus, Bangladesh
- **TAHIR MAHMOOD** (former chairman of National Commission for Minorities) says that **instant triple talaq is un-Islamic and does not have Quranic sanction**
- **SAYYADA HAMEED** says that due to triple talaq, **Muslim women would live in perpetual fear**

### Misuse of Triple Talaq

- The power of triple talaq which Muslim men enjoyed was misused and abused very widely
- Sometimes triple talaq was pronounced in the absence of the wife - **on phone, SMS, Facebook chat, WhatsApp**
- It was sometimes pronounced for very petty reasons
- It made Muslim women greatly dependent on the whims and fancy of their husbands

### Feminist Analysis

**KAMLA BHASIN** says:

- **All religions including Islam are patriarchal**
- Even if practices like triple talaq have scriptural sanction, for gender justice we should do away with such practices

### Criticism of the Ban

**SALMAN KHURSHID** in his book **"Triple Talaq - Examining Faith"** says:

- This banning of triple talaq is **part of the political agenda of the Hindutva forces**
- **To demonize Muslims and Islam**
- To portray Muslims as somewhat barbaric and anti-women, misogynistic

**All India Muslim Personal Law Board** argues:

- **State intervention in the personal affairs of a community is not welcome**
- The secular Indian state should not intervene in the personal affairs of a religious community
- If this is accepted, it might open up a Pandora's box - tomorrow the state might ban karva chauth as patriarchal, raksha bandhan as patriarchal, mangalsutra as patriarchal

## HIJAB (78:04)

- **Hijab**: A head covering worn by Muslim women in public
- In some countries it is mandatory to wear hijab, such as Afghanistan and Iran

### Global Context

#### European Perspective

- Many European countries have imposed a **ban on the burqa**, such as France and Denmark
- Muslims are mostly immigrants in Europe
- How Muslim immigrant women dress up in public has been an issue of much debate in Europe

#### Iran Protests

- There were widespread protests against the mandatory wearing of hijab in Iran
- Wide spread protests in Iran against the mandatory wearing of hijab

#### Karnataka Ban

- In Karnataka, the government **banned the wearing of hijab in educational institutions**
- There were protests against the ban on hijab in India

### Arguments Against the Hijab Ban

#### Access to Education

- There are many Muslim girls whose education will suffer if they are not allowed to wear hijab
- Many Muslim families, orthodox as they are, will not allow them to go to schools without a hijab
- It will hamper the education of the Muslim girl child

#### Personal Choice and Religious Freedom

- It should be more of a personal choice - a girl should be able to decide whether she wants to wear it or not
- **"My body, my rules"** - whether to wear it or not is up to the individual
- There are many women who wear it voluntarily due to their religious beliefs
- Different religious communities also have head coverings (comparison made to Christian nuns)

#### Constitutional Rights

- **Freedom to practice one's religion** is mentioned in our Constitution
- Indian secularism means **respecting religious freedom and religious differences**

### Arguments Supporting the Hijab Ban

#### Patriarchal Imposition

- Is it really a free choice of the girl? Or is it imposed by patriarchy?
- It is a patriarchal imposition in families where it is imposed on children
- **Child indoctrination** - if everyone from childhood sees hijab as normal, they will consider it right
- There was a study when American soldiers went to Afghanistan - Afghan women felt bizarre seeing female soldiers in jeans because of child indoctrination

#### Secular Education System

- India is a secular state - no type of religious symbolism should be allowed in government schools and colleges
- **Uniform dress code** should apply to all students regardless of religion

#### Symbol of Oppression

- Hijab is not just clothing - it comes with restrictions and shows patriarchal mindset and control over women and all of their freedoms
- They can't even breathe freely according to their choice

### Scholarly Perspectives

#### Against the Ban

**NIVEDITA MENON** writes:

- **A compulsory uniform in schools and colleges does not create equality and justice**
- It **represents the power of the institution to control its students**
- Institutions use this power to **socialize students into the dominant norms of the society**
- **The hijab ban in Karnataka reflects explicitly the project of building a Hindu rashtra** in which minorities are marginalized
- The hijab ban in Karnataka is **similar to such bans in Europe but it is against Indian secularism**
- **Indian secularism means respecting religious freedom and religious differences**
- **Indian feminists should champion the rights of Muslim girls to education as well as to their religious beliefs**

**UMA CHAKRAVARTI** and bodies like:

- **AIDWA (All India Democratic Women's Association)**
- **AIPWA (All India Progressive Women's Association)**

Argue that **the hijab ban imposes apartheid on Muslim girls**

**The hijab ban is only the latest pretext of Hindu supremacists to boycott Muslims**

**Indian Constitution requires that educational institutions nurture plurality, not uniformity**

#### Supporting the Ban

**FADELA AMARA** says:

- **The veil is a visible symbol of the subjugation of women**
- **The veil has no place in mixed secular spaces such as the public education system**

**According to SAMHAJI**, **the burqa represents obscurantist fundamentalist right wing forces and is against the democratic principle of equality**

### Islamic Feminism

- **Islamic Feminism**: Refers to feminist thought concerning the role of women in Islam and Muslim societies
- **Islamic feminists champion equality of all Muslims irrespective of gender in both public and private spheres of life**
- Islamic feminists **advocate women's rights, social justice and gender equality within an Islamic framework**
- They **interpret the Quran and the Hadith as promoting gender equality**
- They **criticize patriarchal and misogynistic interpretations of Islam**

**Prominent Islamic feminists:** LEILA AHMED and AMINA WADUD

## KINSHIP, LINEAGE AND DESCENT (114:04)

### Definition and Basic Concepts

- **Kinship**: Relationship - who are relatives (in anthropology and sociology we refer to them as kin)
- **Kin can be of two types: Consanguinal and Affinal**
  - **Consanguinal kin**: Those who are related by blood
  - **Affinal kin**: Those who are related by marriage

### Classification of Kin by Closeness

**According to S.C. DUBE, there are eight primary kin:**

1. Father
2. Mother  
3. Brother
4. Sister
5. Wife
6. Husband
7. Son
8. Daughter

**Secondary kin:** Primary kin of the primary kin of the ego who are not the primary kin of the ego

**Tertiary kin:** The primary kin of secondary kin of the ego and the secondary kin of the primary kin of the ego who are not the primary kin and secondary kin of the ego

- According to MURDOCH, there are **33 secondary kin**
- According to MURDOCH, there are **151 tertiary kin**

### Functions of Kinship System

**The kinship system regulates social life in various ways as follows:**

1. **Lays down appropriate ways of behavior between individuals** - you will behave differently with your younger brother than with your father

2. **Regulates social alliances** - kinship system determines whom you can marry and whom you cannot marry

3. **Regulates the transfer of property, inheritance, exchange of gifts, ritual rules, political succession** - many communities have custom of tying turban after an old person dies, typically the elder son

4. **Provides social recognition to biological acts of sex and reproduction** - when a child is born, he is assigned an identity of a certain kin group

5. **Source of social identity, group membership and solidarity**

### IRAVATI KARVE's Four Kinship Zones

**IRAVATI KARVE** in her book **"Social Organization in India"** has divided India into **four kinship zones along linguistic lines:**

1. **Northern Zone**
2. **Southern Zone** 
3. **Central Zone**
4. **Eastern Zone**

## NORTHERN KINSHIP ZONE (134:57)

### Languages Spoken

- Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, Assamese, Nepali, Pahari, and Sindhi

### Features of Northern Kinship System

#### 1. Kinship Terminology

- **Separate kinship terms are used for consanguinal kin and affinal kin**
- Clear status distinction between consanguinal kin and affinal kin
- Examples: Bhai (brother) vs Sala (wife's brother), Pitaji (father) vs Sasur ji (wife's father), Maa (mother) vs Saas (wife's mother)

#### 2. Generational Distinctions

- **Different kinship terms are used for kin belonging to different generations, particularly up to three generations**
- Clear and distinct terms are used
- Examples: Bhaiya (elder brother), Pitaji (father), Dadaji (father's father)

#### 3. Marriage Rules

- **Caste endogamy**
- **Gotra exogamy** - Four gotras have to be avoided:
  - Own gotra
  - Mother's gotra  
  - Maternal grandmother's gotra
  - Paternal grandmother's gotra
- **Sapinda exogamy** - Five generations on the mother side and seven generations on the father side have to be avoided
- **Village exogamy** - You don't marry within the same village

#### 4. Status Hierarchy

- **A clear status distinction and hierarchy is maintained between bride givers and bride takers**
- **The status of bride takers is far higher than the status of bride givers**
- There is a **continuous flow of gifts from bride givers to bride takers** (one way, lifelong)
- The position of **son-in-law** in the northern zone is very elevated - visits are rare and momentous occasions

#### 5. Position of Bride

- **The position of a bride in her in-law's house is very difficult**
- She is expected to behave very differently in her father-in-law's house than in her father's house
- **Her position improves significantly after the birth of a son**

#### 6. No Exchange System

- **There is no system of exchange of daughters** between families and clans
- **The kinship circle in the northern zone is ever expanding**

## SOUTHERN KINSHIP ZONE (152:57)

### Languages Spoken

- Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Telugu (Dravidian language families)

### Similarities with Northern Zone

- **Caste endogamy**
- **Clan exogamy** 
- **Patrilineal and patrilocal system** (though some communities also have matrilineal and matrilocal systems)

### Unique Features of Southern Zone

#### 1. Matrilineal Communities

- Some communities follow **matrilineal and matrilocal system**
- Such as **NAYARS, TIYYA, MOPLA**
- The matrilineal household is known as **THARAVAD**
- **There are no affinal kin in the tharavad** (because women stay with their mothers and sisters)
- Authority is not matriarchal - **authority is vested in the woman's unmarried brother**

#### 2. Marriage Rules

- **There is no village exogamy rule in the south**
- Frequently you will find marriages within a village in the south
- **System of preferential marriages** exists

#### 3. Preferential Marriages

- **Certain categories of kin are to be preferred as marriage mates**
- For a male ego, **marriage to his elder sister's daughter is to be preferred** (mama-bhanji marriage)
- For a female ego, **marriage to her mother's younger brother**

#### 4. Cross vs Parallel Cousins

- **Cross cousins**: Children of siblings of opposite sexes
- **Parallel cousins**: Children of siblings of same sex
- **Cross cousin marriage is permissible** while **parallel cousin marriage is prohibited**
- Such marriages lead to double relationships - your cousin is also your wife

#### 5. Exchange of Women

- **Exchange of daughters and women between clans** (unlike in the north)

#### 6. Position of Women

- **The position of women in the southern zone is relatively better than in the north**
- Unlike in north where after marriage the girl goes to a completely stranger household, in south frequently she is getting married into people she knows
- If the son-in-law misbehaves, the girl's mother (who is his elder sister) can intervene

#### 7. Property and Kinship Terms

- **Property remains within few clans** (unlike north where it dissipates)
- **In the south there is no clear distinction between consanguinal and affinal kin**
- **More than the generation, age relative to the ego is important**
- Same term may be used for both elder brother and father (like Anna)

## CENTRAL KINSHIP ZONE (165:23)

### Geographical Coverage

- Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha

### Characteristics

- **The central zone lies between the northern zone and the southern zone**

- Their kinship patterns are similar to those regions

## EASTERN KINSHIP ZONE (172:17)

### Geographical Coverage

- **Not geographically contiguous** (not in one piece, broken)
- Includes the **forested areas of Assam, Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Central India**

### Languages

**Two groups:**

1. **Mundari languages** like Santhali and Ho
2. **Mon-Khmer languages** like Khasi

### Mundari Speaking Peoples

- **Patrilineal and patrilocal system dominates**
- Some tribes like **HO and MUNDA have a dormitory system**
- **Dormitory system**: Institutionalized premarital sex is socially permissible for young boys and girls
- Partner of dormitory days is not necessarily the spouse one gets married to

### Khasi Community

- **Khasi have a matrilineal system**
- **But the husband and wife stay together after marriage** (unlike Nayars)
- **Property goes to the youngest daughter**
- **The position of man after marriage is similar to the position of a newly wed Hindu bride in the northern zone**

### Marriage Practices
