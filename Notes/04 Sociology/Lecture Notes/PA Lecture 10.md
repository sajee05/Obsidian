# DURKHEIM's Theory of Religion and Division of Labor

## Recap of Functionalism (22:03)

- **Functionalism Definition**: Function is the contribution that a social institution makes to the maintenance and well being of the whole society

### Major Criticisms of Functionalism
- **Value Consensus Assumption**: Functionalists assume a value consensus which may not exist in the society
- **Conflict and Chaos Ignored**: It sees society as very orderly, very peaceful and harmonious, which may not be the case
- **Status Quo Justification**: It kind of justifies the status quo or the prevailing arrangements in society
- **Tautological Explanations**: It equates the causes and the functions of the society - it erroneously equates causes with functions
- **Individual Agency Ignored**: It ignores the agency of the individual - according to functionalist, society decides and the individual merely follows the dictates of the society

## DURKHEIM's Theory of Religion (28:00)

- **Primary Work**: "The Elementary Forms of Religious Life"
- **Religion Definition by DURKHEIM**: Religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices related to sacred things

### Sacred vs Profane Distinction (37:38)

#### Sacred Things
- **Definition**: Sacred things are those which are set apart and forbidden
- **Examples**: Holy Bible for Christians, Ganga for Hindus, cows in Hindu culture, sacred books, religious symbols

#### Profane Things  
- **Definition**: Ordinary, everyday things
- **Examples**: Tap water, donkey, everyday objects used casually

#### Relationship Between Sacred and Profane (37:38)

1. **Separation**: The sacred is always separated and set apart from all other objects

2. **Forbidden Access**: The sacred thing is that which the profane cannot touch and should not touch with impunity
   - Detailed rules and regulations are laid down detailing how the sacred is to be approached
   - Sacred cannot be casually interacted with

3. **Protection**: The sacred is protected and isolated through strong prohibitions and taboos

4. **Not About Utility**: It is not the utility of a thing which makes it sacred
   - Anything can be sacred - a pebble, a stone, a color, a symbol, a plant, an animal, a geographical formation
   - The sacred is not superior in terms of utility to the profane
   - Often times profane may be far more useful than the sacred

5. **Power and Dignity**: The sacred is infinitely superior to the profane in terms of power and dignity

6. **Context Dependency**: Things are not inherently or always sacred or profane
   - Objects may make a passage from the profane to the sacred and from sacred to profane through rituals
   - The same thing may be regarded as sacred in a certain context and profane in another
   - Examples: Laddus are profane when purchased, but become sacred when taken to temple; Bhagawa rang when used to play holi is profane, but when used in religious context becomes sacred

## Study of the ARUNTA Tribe (62:08)

### Tribal Organization
- **Type**: Small-sized, simple and primitive tribe of aborigines (original inhabitants of Australia)
- **Social Structure**: The ARUNTA tribe is divided into exogamous clans
  - **Exogamy**: Marrying outside one's group (opposite of endogamy - marrying within one's group)
  - In Indian society: Cast endogamy but gotra exogamy

### Totemism (66:24)
- **Clan Symbols**: Each clan was represented by a particular plant or animal symbol
- **Totem Definition**: The symbol of the clan is known as totem
- **Clan Flags**: Each clan had its own flag with the symbol carved on it
- **Churunga/Bull Roarer**: The totem was also carved on the churunga (a piece of wood with thread that made sound like bull roaring when swirled)

#### Religious Significance
- **Sacred Object**: The churunga was a very sacred object for the members of the clan
- **Worship**: The churunga was an integral part of their various religious practices
- **Central Finding**: Members of a clan worship their totem, and the totem represents the clan itself

### DURKHEIM's Key Conclusion (73:15)
- **Religion as Self-Worship**: Religion is simply members of a society worshipping itself
- **God and Society**: God is society divinized - God and society are not two different things, God is society itself
- **Society Worship**: Religion is nothing but society worshipping itself

## Functions of Religion (77:04)

### 1. Shared Sense of Morality (78:05)
- Religion provides the members of a society with a shared sense of morality
- Helps develop a consensus on what is considered as good and bad conduct
- Example: We worship Sri Ram because he was the ideal man (Maryada Purushottam) who conformed to the shared morality of the society

### 2. Social Control (81:12)
- Religion helps the society to maintain social control
- Gives a very strict code of dos and don'ts
- Certain things are defined as sacred and certain things are taboo
- When important social rules are codified in religion as sacred, it provides a very effective mechanism of social control
- Religious sanctions are stronger than legal sanctions

### 3. Relationship Between Man and God/Society (84:09)
- **Key Insight**: The relationship between man and God is exactly the same as the relationship between man and society
- **Nature of Relationship**: It is a relationship of man's dependence on God/society
- **Characteristics**: Very unequal, asymmetrical arrangement where God/society is all powerful and individual is dependent
- **Function**: Imbues people with sense of humility, acknowledging their limitations and dependence

### 4. Source of Strength During Difficult Times (91:01)
- Religion is an important source of strength particularly during difficult times
- **Specific Focus**: Particularly tragic events like death
- **Mechanisms**: 
  - Provides concepts like afterlife, soul continuing to exist
  - Denies or rationalizes the fact of death
  - Society comes together during religious rituals to offer support and consolation

### 5. Collective Effervescence (96:20)
- **Religious Rituals**: Accompanied by collective singing, chanting and dancing
- **Collective Effervescence**: Such collective acts produce a collective effervescence which strengthens the bonds binding the individual to the religious community
- **Examples**: Chanting "Jai Mata Di" collectively, singing national anthem, Islamic Azan
- **Effect**: Creates pulsating energy when collectivity sings or dances together, increases sense of commitment and bonding

### 6. Social Solidarity (102:17)
- **Primary Function**: Religion is an important source of social solidarity
- **Unifying Force**: It serves as a unifying force that enhances social cohesion
- **Complete Definition**: Religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices related to sacred things which unites its members into a single moral community called the church

## Religion in Modern Society (121:00)

### Secularization Process
- **Context**: DURKHEIM was writing in late 19th/early 20th century after French and Industrial revolutions
- **Apparent Decline**: Religion seemed to be on perceptible decline in European society - process of secularization
- **Science Replacement**: Science had replaced religious theological explanations

### DURKHEIM's Interpretation
- **Religion Not Dead**: According to DURKHEIM, religion had not declined or died in modern society
- **New Sacreds**: The old notions of sacred have been replaced by a new set of sacreds
- **Nation Worship**: Modern society is characterized by nation worship

#### New Sacred Objects
- **National Flag**: Sacred in DURKHEIM's sense - cannot be treated casually, governed by flag code
- **National Anthem**: Produces collective effervescence, strengthens bond with nation
- **Constitution**: Sacred text of modern society providing constitutional morality
- **National Emblem**: New sacred symbols

#### Necessity of New Sacreds
- **Heterogeneous Society**: Modern society is heterogeneous and multicultural unlike traditional homogeneous society
- **Need for Unity**: Multicultural, multi-religious society needs new shared morality and sacred symbols
- **Civic Religion**: Modern society characterized by civic religion that cuts across parochial identities

## Major Criticisms of DURKHEIM's Theory of Religion (131:02)

### 1. Ignores Conflict and Violence (131:15)
- **One-Sided Focus**: Downplays/ignores the huge amounts of conflict and violence that religion spawns or generates throughout history
- **Historical Evidence**: Religion has led to greatest bloodbaths - communal riots, crusades, Shia-Sunni divide, wars between religious communities

### 2. Methodological Issues (134:19)
- **Armchair Sociology**: DURKHEIM was an armchair sociologist who never visited the ARUNTA tribe
- **Secondary Sources**: Based analysis on ethnographies written by others, potentially biased
- **Zero Field Work**: Did no direct field work

### 3. Sacred-Profane Dichotomy (135:49)
- **False Dichotomy**: Creates categories of sacred and profane as if they are dichotomous (either/or)
- **Reality**: In real life, many things may be neither purely sacred nor profane
- **Examples**: Notebooks (not Bhagavad Gita but also not purely profane due to association with Vidya), daily meals, money (Lakshmi Mata association)

### 4. Limited Applicability (139:49)
- **Small Scale Focus**: Theory may help explain religious beliefs of primitive small scale ARUNTA tribe
- **Complex Religions**: May not be equally applicable to large scale complex world religions like Islam or Hinduism
- **Multiple Elements**: Modern religions have multiple philosophies, scriptures, interpretations, hierarchies

### 5. Incomplete Secularization (141:01)
- **Persistence of Old**: Old sacreds have not been completely replaced by new sacreds in modern societies
- **Continued Relevance**: Traditional religions continue to play important role

### 6. Source of Immorality (141:44)
- **Oppressive Aspects**: Religion also legitimizes oppression and exploitation
- **Regressive Practices**: Satipratha, child marriage, polygamy, untouchability received sanction from religion
- **AMBEDKAR's Critique**: Religion, especially Hinduism, can be source of immorality teaching practices like untouchability

### 7. Patriarchal Nature (143:13)
- **Feminist Criticism**: Scholars like KAREN ARMSTRONG and KAMLA BHASIN suggest all major religions are patriarchal
- **Women's Oppression**: Religions justify women's oppression
- **Examples**: 
  - Hinduism: Passages in MANUSMRITI against women's rights
  - Islam/Judaism: Women considered half witness, practices like hijab, nikah halala, triple talaq

### 8. Tribal Unity Issue (145:21)
- **Unity Beyond Totem**: ARUNTA people were unified at level of tribe, not only at level of clan
- **Missing Factor**: Since totem was clan specific, there must be something other than totem which unified Aruna people across clan lines

## Introduction to Division of Labor (148:55)

### Basic Concept
- **Book Title**: "Division of Labor in Society" - DURKHEIM's first major work (PhD thesis)
- **Definition**: Division of labor means the splitting up of an activity into a number of smaller processes
- **Specialization**: These different processes are then undertaken by different persons

### Economic Perspective vs DURKHEIM's Approach
- **Economists' Focus**: ADAM SMITH and economists saw division of labor as beneficial for production efficiency
- **Industrial Revolution**: Division of labor led to massive increase in production and productivity
- **Example**: 10 persons producing 10 shirts vs 1000 shirts with division of labor

#### DURKHEIM's Different Approach (156:25)
- **Beyond Economy**: For DURKHEIM, division of labor was not merely in the realm of economy or production
- **Broader Benefits**: Its beneficial effects were not confined to only increase in production and efficiency
- **Whole Society**: Division of labor benefits the whole of the society
- **Vital Needs**: Division of labor meets some very vital needs of the society
- **Universal Presence**: Division of labor exists in every aspect of our social lives - family, education system, etc.

### The Central Question (159:41)
- **Modern Society Problem**: Modern society is characterized by heightened individualism (vs traditional society's collectivism)
- **Critical Issue**: If each person is striving for their own goals and objectives, what prevents society from falling apart?

| **Comparison** | **Traditional Society** | **Modern Society** |
|---|---|---|
| **Orientation** | Collective orientation (Collectivism) | Heightened individualism |
| **Individual Focus** | Suppressed individual aspirations | Legitimized individualism |
| **Social Challenge** | - | How does society hold together when everyone pulls in different directions? |
