# Development of Sociology: Historical Context and Intellectual Influences

## INTRODUCTION: SOCIETAL CHANGE AND ANXIETY (00:00)

- In any society, whatever is the prevailing arrangements, people tend to develop a sense of comfort or at the very least a sense of acquaintance with that prevailing arrangement
- Change is somewhat irksome. It is unnerving in the sense, people don't know what will follow
- These French and industrial revolutions led to a lot of changes in Europe
- There was a lot of anxiety amongst people at large and also social philosophers like COMTE and DURKHEIM about what is really happening and where we are headed and what are the solutions to these new problems that we are encountering
- Problems of poverty and inequality and lack of housing in urban areas and sanitation

## COMPARISON OF FRENCH AND INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS (01:09)

### Similarities Between Both Revolutions
- Both were revolutionary or both led to very drastic changes in the society, very fundamental changes in the society
- Both were in terms of time period coinciding with each other
- Both in terms of their impact were not confined to the societies in which they first occurred but had a much wider impact throughout Europe and then in various other parts of the world as well

### Differences Between Both Revolutions
- The French revolution was in the main in the realm of the ideological and political
- The industrial revolution in the main or what it began as was in the changes in the economy and technology

## PRE-MODERN VS MODERN INEQUALITIES (02:17)

- **Key Question:** Glaring inequalities were there even in premodern society. So what was new about glaring inequalities or why were they so glaring in the modern society?

### The Critical Difference
- Yes inequalities were there even in the premodern society - differences between estates and one of the reasons for the French revolution
- **The key difference was that with modernity the legitimacy of inequality was questioned**
- **Why that was questioned:** Because stuff like liberty and equality became the new ideals
- There was a contradiction which became very apparent in these western societies theoretically or in terms of ideology. They espoused the ideal of equality
- But in social life, there were stark differences in people's capabilities or people's endowments
- That now seemed unacceptable given the new ideology of equality

## NATURE OF REVOLUTIONS: HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE (04:39)

### On Violence in Revolutions
- It is not entirely correct to say that the present revolutions are more violent than the earlier ones
- Even earlier there have been very bloody revolutions. Revolutions more often than not are bloody
- The industrial revolution being a good exception
- The French revolution was bloody. The BOLSHEVIK revolution in Russia was bloody. Even in China, it was bloody
- So, revolutions tend to be bloody and these were all earlier, not in the present day and age
- In the present day and age, the protests in Iran cannot be termed as a revolution in the sociological sense of the term. They were not revolutionary and they were barely violent

### Different Societal Trajectories (06:25)
- Different societies have different trajectories
- The position of women or the perceived or considered legitimate social role for women varies from society to society
- What may be very obvious or taken for granted as the norm in the western world may not be so obvious or so taken for granted in Iranian society
- You do have in every society including the non-western societies whether it is Iran or India a stratum of the population including women from the elite sections who are exposed to the western notions and ideologies

## FOUNDING FATHERS' EVOLUTIONARY VIEW (07:52)

- The founding fathers many of them had this evolutionary view of society that all societies pass through certain almost fixed kind of stages
- **But that notion does not is not very popular anymore**
- Because different societies can take very different trajectories

## DISRUPTIVE NATURE OF POSITIVE CHANGES (08:26)

- These are all positive changes, but these changes were very disruptive
- Whenever you have change, people were used to the monarchical form of government since centuries and now you have a new form of government, a new political philosophy governing social life
- It led to a lot of chaos. The republic which was declared lasted only for a short while
- France was in a lot of socio-political turmoil for a lot of period after the French revolution also. It wasn't a period of calm and serenity
- The early social thinkers were trying to come to terms with those changes. It wasn't a smooth affair by any stretch

## ANCIENT INFLUENCES ON SOCIOLOGY (09:26)

### Timeline and Intellectual Heritage
- Sociology has been though it's a new discipline less than 200 years ago but it has been influenced by developments more than 2,000 years back going back to that ancient period
- If we go back to more than 2,000 years you had several philosophers lawgivers statesmen writing at great length about various aspects of social life
- A lot of this modern western knowledge traces itself back to the ancient Greek philosophers

### Ancient Greek Philosophers (10:40)
- **SOCRATES, PLATO, ARISTOTLE** - remembered as SPA sequence
- Scholars or philosophers like SOCRATES, PLATO, ARISTOTLE writing more than 2,000 years back wrote at length about some of the very same social issues that modern sociology is grappling with

### Eastern Philosophers
- Whether it is these western philosophers or lawgivers and philosophers of the east like **CONFUCIUS, BUDDHA, MANU, KAUTILYA**
- They were dealing with the nature of their respective societies, writing on issues ranging from social inequality

### Common Themes Across Ancient Thinkers
1. **Social Inequality:** What should be the relationship between different social classes
2. **Nature of the Ideal State:** What is the nature of the state
3. **Questions of Citizenship:** Who should have a right to participate in public life
4. **Nature of Man-Woman Relationship**
5. **Nature of Family Life**
6. **Role of Education in Society**

- Many of these questions are as alive today. Many of these questions were what the early sociologists in the 19th century were also writing about

### PLATO's Contribution (14:14)
- **Natural vs Social Inequality Discussion:** PLATO discussed in detail about the relationship between natural inequality and social inequality
- **Natural inequality** simply means people are endowed differently by nature. Nature has made all of us different
- For example, one person will be taller than the other, fatter than the other, prettier than the other, fairer than the other, perhaps more intellectually gifted than the other
- **Social inequalities** are inequalities in terms of power, prestige and wealth
- Between any two people, one will be richer than the other, more powerful than the other, somebody will have greater respect and command greater respect in society than the other
- **PLATO was very interested in exploring this question: Are social inequalities based upon natural inequalities?**
- In other words, are those who are stronger or more intelligent, richer and more powerful? This is a question that modern sociologists are also dwelling upon

### Relevance vs Outdated Nature (18:57)
**Outdated Aspects:**
- ARISTOTLE suggested that women should not be given citizenship rights because they are fickle in ARISTOTLE's view. He said they should also be fed less
- He was also similarly in contempt about giving any sort of participation in the political system to the poor
- PLATO had some sort of a contempt for democracy. He said if everybody enjoys power then nobody can be held responsible. You need experts or what he termed as a philosopher king to rule over the people

**Still Relevant Aspects:**
- These guys were agitating upon some of the very same questions that are as relevant for contemporary students of society or analysts of society

### Distinction from Modern Sociology (22:02)
**Why Ancient Philosophy ≠ Sociology:**
- The method is what distinguishes not so much the content
- **Modern sociology COMTE onwards or 19th century onwards is characterized by the use of the scientific method unlike the ancient philosophers**
- The ancient philosophers more often than not dealt with questions of how society should be ought to be. What is the nature of the ideal state? How to ensure justice in society rather than talking about how society is based upon an empirical investigation
- We don't call them sociologists. That was not sociology. That can be best termed as social thought. They can be termed as philosophers, social thinkers, not sociologists

### Notable Ancient Works
- **PLATO:** The Republic, The Laws
- **MANU:** Manu Smriti
- **CONFUCIUS:** Confucianism
- **KAUTILYA:** (referenced as similar category)

## THE DARK AGES (24:42)

- The dark ages were dark - a period of ignorance and decline in socio-cultural aspects
- Not much contribution there

## RENAISSANCE PERIOD (25:27)

### Nature of Renaissance
- Renaissance entailed a lot of heightened cultural activity in various realms in art and literature, architecture, poetry, prose, religion, science, explorations in various aspects
- It was a cultural flowering of sorts
- **Parallel:** Like the Mughal period or particularly the period of SHAH JAHAN is considered like a golden period because you had the Taj Mahal being constructed - something similar in Europe there was a lot of flowering in different realms of cultural activities
- It was a reawakening, rebirth of sorts

### Key Renaissance Figures (26:38)
- **SHAKESPEARE:** Writing his dramas and plays (Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Merchant of Venice, Tempest)
- **LEONARDO DA VINCI:** The painting of Mona Lisa, also a scientist interested in human body
- **NEWTON:** The three laws of motion, force is equal to mass into acceleration
- **COPERNICUS:** The heliocentric theory - sun is the center and other planets including earth revolve around it
- **MICHELANGELO:** The statue of David
- **Religious figures:** MARTIN LUTHER, JOHN CALVIN
- **MACHIAVELLI:** Political philosopher
- **Explorers:** VASCO DA GAMA, COLUMBUS

### Two Important Developments During Renaissance

#### 1. Commercial Revolution (29:40)
- **Time Period:** Around 14th century to 18th century
- **Key Developments:**
  - The company form of organization came into being
  - Formalization of the banking system
  - Banking industry growth gave a fillip to trade and commerce
  - This boosted trade and commerce and led to the development of the middle class
- **Significance:** Some centuries later during the French Revolution, this middle class provided leadership to the commoners
- The middle class which provided leadership to the French Revolution developed thanks to the commercial revolution coinciding with the Renaissance period

#### 2. Scientific Revolution (32:25)
- Various discoveries of the scientists came out with new knowledge which challenged the existing knowledge and the source of that knowledge which was church
- The scientific knowledge which came up through the likes of NEWTON or COPERNICUS or GALILEO dented the authority of the church
- **Why it challenged the church:**
  - The church subscribed to the geocentric model that earth is at the center and other things including the sun revolve around it
  - But then you have COPERNICUS saying it is heliocentric or sun is at the center and earth is one of the many planets revolving around it
  - So you're directly contradicting the Holy Bible which says God made man in his own image and you have CHARLES DARWIN claiming we have descended from apes

#### Most Important Discovery: Scientific Method (35:04)
- **The biggest contribution of this period was the discovery of the scientific method itself**
- It was not this or that scientific discovery but the discovery of the scientific method itself
- This method provided now a new basis of what came to be regarded as true knowledge
- Earlier people would have knowledge but the basis of that knowledge was revelation, scriptures, religious figureheads etc.
- **Significance for Sociology:** Some centuries later when sociology emerged, the founding fathers banked upon the scientific method to study society, which was a gift of the scientific revolution

### Defining Features of Renaissance (37:14)

#### 1. Humanism (37:23)
- Human beings became now the center of attention, human social relationships, human emotions
- Art and architecture has existed since ages, but earlier much of this was focused upon God and divinity
- It was all basically centered around God and divine entities but now displacing them, human beings became the center of attention of all art, literature, etc.

#### 2. Realism (38:49)
- Realism means depicting things as they are - a realistic portrayal in contrast to idealism
- Idealism is you depict an ideal situation, how it should be. But a realistic portrayal
- **SHAKESPEARE's Example:** His works are about human social relationships and very real human emotions such as not just love and nice things but also treachery, betrayal, insecurities, all of that. Real life is like that full of all these negative emotions and feelings and complexities and relationships
- **LEONARDO DA VINCI's Example:** When he was painting, he painted some very ordinary looking kind of person, some lady whom he loved - ordinary realistic portrayal
- **MACHIAVELLI's Example:** He wrote The Prince in which he says it's best if a king or a ruler is both loved and feared. But since the two seldom go together, it is better that he be feared - a very realistic portrayal depiction of human affairs

#### 3. Empiricism (42:08)
- Whatever knowledge that you consider true or valid is based upon empirical evidence
- Empirical evidence becoming the source of knowledge
- **LEONARDO DA VINCI's Example:** He was very keenly interested in the human body. He used to pay off grave robbers who would dig graves and take out human corpses and give them to the scientists because there was otherwise a sanctity associated with the human body and they could not through legit means do dissection. But he was like until I see inside how would I know how the human body works and what it comprises of
- There was a lot of emphasis on an empirical basis for knowledge

### Renaissance Influence on Sociology (44:24)
- **Humanism:** When sociology would emerge as a discipline years later it focused on human or the divine aspects? Human aspects. This emphasis on human beings is a legacy of this period
- **Realism:** The discipline of sociology focuses on how society is, social relationships are or how they should be etc. - realistic portrayal
- **Empiricism:** The method that the early sociologists all founding fathers be it COMTE or DURKHEIM or MARX relied upon was the scientific method basing their theories and writings on empirical data

## ENLIGHTENMENT PERIOD (47:04)

### Timeline and Nature
- **Time Period:** 17th to 18th centuries. More 18th century than 17th. The 18th century was the heydays of enlightenment thought
- Enlightenment was a period of a lot of intellectual ferment in Europe
- Several writers, thinkers and philosophers came out with new and that time kind of groundbreaking or radical kind of theories which provided a very alternative explanation of social life
- **Also known as:** The age of reason

### Essence of Enlightenment (49:05)
- **EMMANUEL KANT** very succinctly and beautifully explained or captured the essence of enlightenment
- He says enlightenment means "the freedom to use one's own intelligence"
- **Core Principle:** Do not blindly accept or follow simply what you have been told. Do not accept any knowledge simply because it has a very sacred source or simply because it has been around since ages
- These guys championed a very thorough questioning of long-held beliefs regarding various aspects of our world or our lives

### Key Enlightenment Thinkers and Ideas

#### Social Contract Theory (51:21)
**Key Theorists:** HOBBES, JOHN LOCKE, ROUSSEAU
- Their writings were very different from each other but we club them together for the sake of convenience as social contract theorists
- They all championed the same notion of a social contract

**HOBBES and The Leviathan (52:14):**
- **Leviathan** means a big and powerful monstrous entity - referring to the state/government
- In this book, HOBBES discusses the nature of the state or nature of government or governmental power

**The State of Nature Concept (54:09):**
- Let us imagine a phase of human history when there was no government, no authority, no power holder - they call it the state of nature
- **HOBBES' View:** Life of man in the state of nature is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"
- Imagine we are in that state of nature - no government, no rules and regulations, no authority figure, just a band of human beings doing our thing in the jungle
- It is a situation of a war of each against everyone. Every man is living in perpetual fear of violence and death
- It's matsya nyaya - big fish eat small fish

**The Social Contract (57:18):**
- Precisely because human life was so pathetic, members of the society came to an agreement amongst themselves
- Members of the society voluntarily gave up some of their power and vested it in one person
- This is how government arose or emerged born out of a social contract - a contract entered into by the members of the society
- **Significance:** Government or authority or rulers - it is a social construct created by the members of the society

**Challenge to Divine Theory (59:08):**
- This social contract theory struck at the roots of or directly challenged the divine theory of kingship
- Kings claimed that they have a right to rule because of some sort of a divine sanction - either they are God incarnates or representatives of God chosen by God
- The social contract theory basically argued that the rulers have a right to rule not due to some divine injunction but simply they got the right to rule because the members of the society agreed upon it
- **Therefore:** Government or state power is no divine institution. It is no sacred. It is a social construct

**Democratic Implications (61:34):**
- The logical corollary: We have chosen her as a ruler for our own benefit not to aggrandize her power. The purpose is that we should benefit
- Now if she is incompetent, if she is corrupt, then we can dislodge her and vest that power in him
- The social contract theory laid down the ideological basis for democratic and republican forms of government
- It discredited the monarchical form of government and provided the ideological framework for democratic and republican forms of government
- **NAPOLEON BONAPARTE** once stated: "Had there been no ROUSSEAU there would have been no French Revolution"

#### VOLTAIRE (64:18)
- He used to write in a very satirical manner
- **Famous Quote:** "If there were no God, the ruling classes will create one"
- **Implication:** This notion of God or organized religion benefits the ruling classes. The ruling classes have a vested interest in promoting religion. Religion and political authority are in bed together
- **Influence on MARX:** Years later you will find this viewpoint resonating in the writings of KARL MARX who would write that religion is the opium of the people

#### MONTESQUIEU (66:00)
- Gave the concept of **separation of powers**
- The powers of government should not be concentrated in a person or a body. They should be divided into three separate ones:
  1. The power to make laws
  2. The power to implement laws  
  3. The power to adjudicate upon any disputes arising from their application
- This notion of separation of powers is a very common element in a lot of modern political systems

#### ADAM SMITH (68:01)
- **The Wealth of Nations** (full title: An inquiry into the causes and consequences of the wealth of nations)
- Regarded as the father of free market economics or laissez-faire economics

**Free Market Economics Principles:**
- There should be no or minimal governmental intervention in the working of the economy
- Let the market forces of demand and supply determine economic behavior
- That will lead to the most optimal utilization of the resources of the society

**How Free Market Benefits Society (70:44):**
- **Competition Example:** If someone is manufacturing shirts at ₹100 cost and selling at ₹1000 with ₹900 profit, many people will get attracted to this industry with such high margins
- Competition will increase and that will lower the prices
- Every producer will be forced to produce more efficiently
- Resources of the society get most optimally utilized, production efficiency increases, consumers benefit in terms of lower prices

**Government Intervention Problems (73:07):**
- Government intervention creates artificial imbalances
- **Example:** In India, during license raj period, only BAJAJ enjoyed a near monopoly in scooter production for several years due to government licenses
- That is not healthy - they would produce scooters very inefficiently
- Now since markets have opened up, BAJAJ has stopped producing scooters altogether
- In a free market economy, those who are inefficient will be forced to shut shop

**The Invisible Hand (73:56):**
- There's this invisible hand which guides the market, ensuring the optimal utilization of the societal resources

**Moral Justification for Capitalism (75:00):**
- **Famous Quote:** "It is not from the benevolence of the baker, the butcher or the brewer that we expect our daily dinner, but from their concern for their own self-interest"
- **Explanation:** We don't rely on their large-heartedness or generosity for our daily dinner. They provide services because they are doing it to serve their own interest
- **Key Point:** Self-interest is good, not bad
- If each of us is selfish, driven by self-interest, the society also benefits
- **Historical Impact:** When inventors created spinning jenny, steam engine, or THOMAS EDISON invented the light bulb, they did it for self-interest, not for others
- Pursuit of self-interest is not morally reprehensible. It serves a wider social purpose
- **Significance:** Adam Smith's philosophy created the intellectual framework for the industrial revolution by providing ideological basis for industrial capitalism

## BREAK AND Q&A SESSION (81:25)

### Discussion on State of Nature and Social Contract (91:00)
- **Student Question:** About DARWIN's concept of survival of the fittest in relation to state of nature
- **Response:** HOBBES' theory is somewhat in sync with DARWIN's theory because he's also saying the one who can, will take over from those who can't. If someone is more powerful, they'll take away from others whatever they can
- You also had another social contract theory by ROUSSEAU who said something else - there can be different versions

## TRANSFORMATIVE REVOLUTIONS: SUMMARY (92:32)

### Renaissance Period Contributions
**Scientific Revolution:**
- Entailed new scientific inventions and discoveries
- **Most importantly:** Led to the discovery of scientific method with its emphasis on empirical evidence and mathematization

**Commercial Revolution:**
- Led to the development of the banking industry and the company form of organization
- Also led to the emergence of the middle class which would later provide leadership for the revolutions in Europe

**Cultural Characteristics:**
- During Renaissance, art, literature, science all flourished
- A scientific approach to nature, human body and social institutions became prevalent
- Elements of the natural and the social world became the subject of close observation and experiments
- **The defining features of the Renaissance movement - namely humanism, realism and empiricism - also characterized the discipline of sociology in its early years**

### Enlightenment Period Contributions
- The enlightenment period embodied a new spirit of awakening in European society
- **The age of reason** marked a clear departure from the traditional thinking of feudal Europe
- Intellectuals of the era started questioning each and every aspect of social life
- **Nothing was sacrosanct anymore** - from the authority of the church to the right of the monarch to rule to the very notion of God itself
- Enlightenment thought argued that human beings are essentially rational. The society can be reorganized based on rational principles
- Philosophers like ROUSSEAU, VOLTAIRE, HOBBES, LOCKE, and ADAM SMITH created a new intellectual framework to explain various aspects of social life
- Their writings also laid the foundations for the French and industrial revolutions
- **The intellectual currents unleashed during enlightenment also had a profound bearing on the writings of the early sociologists**

## INTELLECTUAL INFLUENCES ON EARLY SOCIOLOGY (109:02)

### 1. Influence from Biology (110:23)

#### Darwin's Theory of Evolution
- The founding fathers were greatly influenced by DARWIN's theory of evolution
- From biology, early sociologists learned two major related things:

**a) The Organic Analogy (111:03):**
- **Key Thinkers:** COMTE and SPENCER (primarily associated with organic analogy)
- They compared the society to a living organism
- **Structure:** Like a living organism has different body parts (hands, eyes, nose, tongue, legs), the society also has several parts - the various social institutions (family, religion, political system, economy, education system)
- **Interconnection:** Just as different parts of an organism are interconnected and interdependent, various social institutions also work in tandem. There are interconnections between different social institutions
- **Function:** In an organism, different parts perform their respective functions or roles. Similarly, in society, different social institutions perform their respective functions or roles
  - **Eyes:** See
  - **Tongue:** Taste and speak
  - **Skin:** Protects and sweats for temperature regulation
  - **Family:** Socialization of children, reproduction
  - **Political System:** Makes rules and regulations which govern our collective lives
  - **Economy:** Production of goods and services, their exchange through market or barter systems
- **Interdependence Example:** If stomach feels hungry, it can't satisfy its own hunger. Signal goes via nervous system to brain, brain signals eyes to search for food, eyes spot apple, brain signals hand to grab apple, hand puts it to mouth, teeth and salivary glands do their thing, then esophagus, then stomach gets satisfied
- **Social Institution Example:** Education system (like coaching institute) cannot operate in isolation from family or economy. Education system provides skills and knowledge required to perform roles in the economy

**b) Concept of Evolution (120:13):**
- **HERBERT SPENCER** (contemporary of COMTE) - his theory is called **Social Darwinism**
- He provided an evolutionary model or evolutionary view of social change
- **How societies changed:** Just like how life forms have evolved from simple undifferentiated small-sized homogeneous entities into complex large-sized heterogeneous entities (from amoeba to modern complex mammals), similarly societies have evolved from small-scale, primitive, small-sized and relatively homogeneous tribal groups, clans to complex, large-scale, complex nation states of today
- **Simple summary:** Societies like organisms have evolved from simple to complex

### 2. Influence from History (122:57)
- **What was learned:** This concept or notion that society passes through various historical stages
- This idea of classifying society into different historical stages is something learned from historians
- **Example:** In studying history, we classify it into different time periods - ancient history, medieval history, modern history
- **Key Thinkers:** In Europe this was first done by social thinkers like **GIAMBATTISTA VICO** and **SAINT-SIMON**
- This was then reflected later in the writings of early sociologists like **KARL MARX** or COMTE and SPENCER
- **Additional contribution:** Historical data regarding the social conditions at different points of time

### 3. The Notion of Progress (125:50)
- **Background:** In other social sciences there had been several strides or improvements, and thanks to those strides made in these other disciplines human lives had become better in many ways
- **Examples:** Technological breakthroughs, large scale production which was never seen before in human history
- **Development of belief:** This developed the notion of progress that we can nearly perfect things, make them perfect if we can
- **Logic:** If human beings through their hard work and endeavoring can make such great strides in material production (earlier it took one person 10 days to make a shirt, now we are producing thousands in a day - immense progress), then possibly applying similar methods, we can also make immense progress in social institutions
- **Result:** Because of the strides in technology, in the economy, in production, thanks to the industrial revolution, there was a very great belief in the perfectability of human social institutions that developed amongst the early sociologists
- **Summary:** A strong belief in the notion of progress and perfectability of social institutions emerged due to the progress that was witnessed in the realm of technology and production

### 4. The Scientific Method (129:49)
- **Background:** Other sciences - physics, chemistry, biology - had made immense progress and that progress had contributed immensely to improving human lives
- **Application:** The scientific method, the scientific approach was also applied to the investigation of the social conditions
- **Method:** Scientific experimentation, empirical data based approach
- **Goal:** Endeavoring to achieve near perfection or great progress in the realm of social institutions by applying the same methods using which physicists and chemists and biologists had attained immense progress in their respective fields
- **Approach:** Scientific approach based on rational thinking. Problems need to be solved rationally. If confronted with a problem, you don't sit down to pray. You collect data and then analyze it objectively to arrive at certain conclusions

#### Social Survey Method (131:49)
- **Definition:** Social survey means collect quantifiable data for studying social problems and finding their solutions
- **Popularity:** This approach of collecting data from society to address social problems particularly became popular after there was a report titled **"The State of the Poor Report" by EDEN**
- **Impact:** It led to a new mindset of collecting large scale empirical data about the population
- **Paradigm Shift:** 
  - **Earlier:** Social problems were attributed to divine or natural causes. If you are poor, it was because you're weak or dumb or because God has so destined
  - **Now:** Social problems were not attributed to divine or natural causes but problems like poverty were considered an outcome of the social conditions that are prevalent. You are poor because you are uneducated or because you were born in a poor family and that has prevented you from exploring your full potential or you are unemployed
  - **Evidence-based:** This is said based on data collected through a survey, not from imagination, books or divine revelation. For example, in England's population of X, Y are poor. Out of these Y, Z have education only up to the fifth standard and hence there is a correlation between education levels and poverty

### 5. Counter-Enlightenment Thought (135:40)
- **Definition:** Counter-enlightenment thought means enlightenment ideas were opposed or countered by scholars like **DE BONALD** and **DE MAISTRE**
- **Their Position:** These guys were conservative. They saw changes brought about by enlightenment thought as destabilizing, a source of chaos, and therefore undesirable
- **What they opposed:** Enlightenment was about rationality, progress, individualism, scientific temperament, progressive change, junking the old, adopting the new
- **What they preferred:** Restoration of the old order, feudal privileges, monarchical form of government, collective orientation in society rather than individualism
- **Influence on Early Sociology:** Early sociologists were influenced by both enlightenment and counter-enlightenment, but mainly enlightenment. Sociology is a direct result of modernity which is an outcome of enlightenment
- **Example - DURKHEIM:** Early sociologists like DURKHEIM were also quite concerned about the disorder and chaos which was prevalent in the then French society. DURKHEIM gave this concept of **anomie** (roughly means chaos or disorder). He was concerned about instability and wanted a restoration of order, but not the old order - that's where he differed from counter-enlightenment scholars. There is a concern for social stability and order reflected in the writings of early sociologists like DURKHEIM

### Academic Perspective (140:55)
- **IRVING ZEITLIN** in his book **"Ideology and the Development of Sociological Theory"** contends that **early sociology developed as a reaction to enlightenment**
- Most of the currents discussed were enlightenment period influences:
  - Rationalism
  - Scientific thought  
  - Biological theory of evolution
  - Historical periodization
  - Counter-enlightenment
  - Preoccupation with stability and order
- All of this was enlightenment era influence which resulted in the emergence of sociology
