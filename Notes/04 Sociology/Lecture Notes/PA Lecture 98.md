### Constitutional Critique by PRITAM SINGH

- **Federal Structure Issue**: India is union of states, against federal policy, will promote Hindu culture as majority is Hindu
- **Article 48**: Cow protection reflects pro-Hindu bias
- **Article 25(2B)**: Government can open up Hindu institutions for Hindu backward classes - shows intent to save Hinduism and prevent exodus of lower class from Hindu fold

## HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF EDUCATION SYSTEM (63:42)

### Ancient Period - Gurukul System

#### Nature of Guru

- **Literal Meaning**: GU (darkness/ignorance) + RU (to dispel) = Dispeller of darkness or ignorance
- **Elevated Position**: Gurus enjoyed very elevated position in society, next only to God
- **Sacred Status**: "GURU BRAHMA, GURU VISHNU, GURU DEVO MAHESHWARA, GURU SAKSHAD PARAM" - literally drawing parallel between guru and various forms of God

#### Gurukul System Characteristics

- **Residential Nature**: Gurukuls were residential schools where shishya used to stay with guru and his family for long periods
- **Holistic Role**: Guru performed multifaceted role in life of shishya
- **Role as Exemplar**: Living together meant guru must necessarily lead by example

#### Guru's Multifaceted Role

1. **Domain Knowledge**: Imparted various subjects quite like modern day teachers
2. **Life Skills**: Taught how to deal with anger, jealousy, ego, failure, hurt, thanklessness
3. **Values**: Created moral base for shishya, helped frame ethical compass  
4. **Spiritual Guide**: Aided shishya in spiritual exploration and journey

#### Differences from Modern Teachers

| Ancient Guru                               | Modern Teacher                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Multifaceted role (teacher, mentor, guide) | Limited role, subject-specific                |
| Post-facto voluntary guru dakshina         | Pre-paid fees system                          |
| Selective in choosing shishya              | Anyone with capacity to pay                   |
| Must lead by example (living together)     | Can have gap between teaching and practice    |
| Oral knowledge transmission                | Written transmission                          |
| Few in number, elevated status             | Many in number, lower middle class profession |
| Non-commercialized                         | Commercialized                                |

### Colonial Period Education

#### MACAULAY's Foundation

- **Primary Objective**: Create a class of people who would assist the British in their colonial project of economic exploitation and political subordination of India
- **Famous Quote**: "We must do our best to create a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions we govern - a class of persons Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in morals, in opinion and in intellect"
- **Brown Sahibs**: Successfully created class of people who look Indian but thinking, temperament, values aligned with British

#### Impact of Colonial Education

- **Middle Class Creation**: One important consequence was creation of Indian middle class
- **Dual Role**: This class served intended purpose of aiding colonial rule AND initiated social reforms AND gave leadership to anti-colonial national movement
- **Eurocentric Knowledge**: Indian knowledge systems held in contempt - "whole of literature of India is worth less than one shelf of good library in Europe" (MACAULAY)
- **Knowledge Hierarchy**: Indian traditional sources ignored while Eurocentric knowledge promoted in science, arts, literature, philosophy

#### National Response

- **University Criticism**: KOLKATA University criticized as "gulam khana" (factory manufacturing slaves)
- **Parallel System**: National leaders established parallel national education system under national Indian control
- **Student Focus**: College students particularly targeted for mass-based agitation as formal education system under colonial grip

## POST-INDEPENDENCE EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT (103:35)

## CRITICISMS OF NEP 2020 (175:22)

### AMARTYA SEN's Critique

- **Public Education Weakness**: NEP lacks emphasis on strengthening public education system
- **Private Sector Concern**: Enrollment in private sector already very high compared to many other countries, NEP appears to continue with that
- **Need**: Develop robust network of public schools providing quality education to cover entire population

### JEAN DREZE's Analysis

- **Equity Deficit**: NEP lacks emphasis on equity
- **Existing Inequalities**: Education system already plagued with grave inequalities - all sections don't have equal access to educational opportunities
- **Insufficient Remedy**: NEP doesn't do much to rectify inequality issues

### KRISHNA KUMAR's Concerns

#### Financial Commitments

- **Repetitive Promise**: NEP reiterates allocating 6% GDP to education which has been done many times in past
- **Implementation Doubt**: Real question is whether government will actually allot 6% of GDP to education - earlier governments have not done so

#### Contextual Issues

- **Pandemic Timing**: NEP framed during worst humanitarian crisis (COVID pandemic) but makes only passing reference to pandemic
- **Ill-timing**: Critics argued government should have focused energies on tackling pandemic instead of laying roadmap for new education approach

#### Vocational Education Concerns

- **Early Introduction Problem**: NEP emphasizes promoting vocational education at early age (from sixth onwards)
- **Historical Wisdom**: Earlier commissions like KOTHARI Commission deliberately kept vocational education for later age, not early age
- **Caste-Skill Dichotomy**: In India there's dichotomy between knowledge (respected) and skills (frowned upon)
- **Caste Association**: Many vocational skills associated with lower castes
- **Reinforcement Risk**: Might aggravate problem of caste-occupation linkage, reinforce stigma associated with manual work
- **Dropout Concern**: Students might drop out of education system to earn quick money, reinforcing castist mindset

#### Legal Framework Gap

- **RTE Act Silence**: NEP 2020 is silent on RTE Act which has been governing framework since 2009
- **Uncertain Future**: We don't know what will happen to RTE Act under new policy

### SUKUMAR and CHANDAN GUJRAL's Observations

#### Secular Concerns

- **Missing Word**: Important word "secularism" is missing from this bulky policy document
- **Historical Comparison**: This word was present in 1986 education policy
- **Deliberate Omission**: Seems like deliberate omission indicating ideological shift

#### Religious References

- **NISHKAM KARMA**: NEP makes reference to NISHKAM KARMA (essence of BHAGAVAD GITA philosophy - devotion to duty without attachment to fruits of labor)
- **Religious Association**: Associated with particular religion and therefore problematic
- **Ideological Shift**: Due to these factors, NEP indicates ideological shift of government
