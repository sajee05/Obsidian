# Social Stratification, Mobility, and Hierarchy

## SOCIAL MOBILITY REVIEW (24:07)

- **Social Mobility Definition**: Transition from one social position to another
- **Previous Discussion**: Various aspects of social mobility were covered in the last lecture

### Causes of Social Mobility According to SOROKIN

- **Four Main Factors**:
  1. **Educational Factors**: Education as a pathway for mobility
  2. **Family Relations**: Between parents and children
  3. **Demographic Factors**: Dissimilarity between parents and children
  4. **Social Environment**: Environmental influences
  5. **Faulty Distribution**: Of opportunities and resources

### Inequality Discussion

- **WILKINSON and PICKETT's Views**: Inequality is not just about levels of material prosperity but levels of inequality itself
- **Impact**: If a society is very developed and rich but has high inequality levels, then large segments of the population will suffer in terms of health, stress, and high rates of crime

## HIERARCHY AND SOCIAL STRATIFICATION (27:04)

### Definition of Hierarchy

- **Hierarchy**: Vertical arrangement of either individuals or social groups, one above the other
- **Types of Hierarchical Arrangements**:
  1. **Hierarchy of Positions**: As in bureaucracy (organizational hierarchy)
  2. **Hierarchy of Social Groups**: Different social groups vertically arranged (social stratification)
  3. **Hierarchy of Individuals**: Individual persons arranged vertically (social inequality)

### Relationship Between Hierarchy, Stratification, and Inequality

- **Key Distinction**: These are related but different concepts
- **Social Stratification**: One form of social inequality
- **Possibility**: You can have inequality in society without social stratification being present

| Concept                   | Definition                                      | Key Features                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Social Stratification** | Different social groups hierarchically arranged | • Shared common culture/subculture<br>• Common lifestyle and interests<br>• Self-identification as members of that strata |
| **Social Inequality**     | Hierarchical arrangement of individuals         | • No group formation<br>• Individual positioning<br>• No shared class consciousness                                       |
| **Hierarchy**             | Vertical arrangement (general concept)          | • Can be of positions, groups, or individuals<br>• Structural organization                                                |

### Western Society Analysis

- **Some Commentators' View**: Western societies no longer have social stratification
- **Instead**: They have individuals placed in a hierarchy without constituting distinct classes or strata
- **Reasoning**: People earning different amounts (₹10,000, ₹11,000, ₹12,000, etc.) may have vastly different lifestyles and interests despite similar income levels
- **Result**: No common class interest, no sense of belonging together

## DEPRIVATION AND BOURDIEU'S CAPITAL THEORY (39:30)

### Definition of Deprivation

- **Deprivation**: Simply means not having something
- **Two Types**:
  1. **Absolute Deprivation**: Not having certain things considered necessary for well-being (basic necessities like food, clothing, housing)
  2. **Relative Deprivation**: People feel deprived only when they compare their position with others

### Relative Deprivation Theory

- **Developed by**: STOUFFER and later improved by MERTON
- **Origin**: Study of American soldiers - married American soldiers felt relatively deprived when compared to unmarried soldiers and married civilians
- **Key Scholar**: MUZAFFER SHERIF also contributed extensively to this concept

### BOURDIEU'S Four Types of Capital

- **Critique of Classical Marxism**: BOURDIEU argues that deprivation is not just economic - the privileged pass on four types of capital to their children

| Type of Capital      | Definition                         | Examples                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Economic Capital** | Wealth and property                | Money, property, financial assets          |
| **Social Capital**   | Social connections and networks    | Contacts, connections, influence networks  |
| **Cultural Capital** | Appreciation of legitimate culture | Education, taste in art, music, literature |
| **Symbolic Capital** | Reputation for expertise           | Recognition, prestige, reputation          |

#### Cultural Capital Breakdown

**Three Types of Culture**:

1. **Legitimate Culture (Good Taste)**:
   
   - Passed on by top sections of society
   - Appreciation of art, music, literature, modern art
   - Classical music, sophisticated cultural forms

2. **Middle Brow Culture**:
   
   - Art forms with some artistic merit
   - Less than legitimate culture
   - Art house cinema, fusion music

3. **Populist Culture**:
   
   - Songs and art forms without artistic pretensions
   - Mass entertainment
   - Popular music, commercial entertainment

### Capital Interconnectedness

- **Key Point**: Having one type of capital helps acquire other types
- **Example**: Social connections help earn money; money helps build connections; education helps earn money; money helps get better education
- **Conversely**: Being deprived of one form contributes to deprivation of other forms

## NEW MIDDLE CLASS (69:43)

### Historical Context

- **MARX's Prediction**: Middle class would sink into the proletariat as capitalism advances
- **Reality**: Opposite happened - middle class expanded in 20th century advanced capitalism
- **WEBER's Analysis**: Extensive writing on middle class expansion

### Causes of Middle Class Expansion

- **Primary Factors**:
  1. **Bureaucratization**: Growth of bureaucratic structures
  2. **Rationalization**: Systematic organization of society
  3. **Skill Enhancement**: Increasing demand for skilled workers
  4. **Changing Occupational Structure**: Shift towards white-collar jobs
  5. **Fertility Rate Differences**: Between classes

### Middle Class Characteristics

#### Economic Features

- **Income Level**: Medium level income and wealth
- **Economic Buffer**: Unlike poor, they don't worry about next meal; unlike rich, they don't have unlimited resources
- **Example**: "We have milk and curd in the fridge, not flowing rivers of milk and curd"

#### Occupational Profile

- **White Collar Occupations**: Software engineers, doctors, lawyers, accountants, auditors, teachers, managers
- **Non-Manual Labor**: Do not engage in manual labor

#### Educational Orientation

- **High Value on Education**: Greatly values education as ticket to better life
- **Primary Channel**: Education seen as main path for social mobility
- **Investment**: Sizable chunk of middle class budget assigned for child education
- **Certificate Collection**: Typical middle class trait - maintaining folder of educational certificates from childhood

#### Behavioral Patterns

- **Deferred Gratification**: Postponing pleasure for future benefits
- **Future Orientation**: Planning and working for long-term goals
- **Saving Habits**: Regular saving for future needs
- **Example Pattern**: "Study hard now, enjoy later" - from 10th standard through higher education

### Political Implications

#### LIPSET's Analysis

- **New Middle Class Support Base**: Led to success of extreme political ideologies like Nazism and Fascism
- **Indian Parallel**: Some commentators explain rise of Hindutva through expanding middle class support

#### Middle Class Political Behavior

- **Self-Perception**: See themselves as fulcrum of social order and guardians of culture
- **Support Tendency**: Tend to support extremist ideologies and populist movements
- **Feeling Threatened**: From both rich (who might consume them) and poor (who might overwhelm them)

### Affluent Workers Study

#### GOLDTHORPE, LOCKWOOD and Others Study

- **Focus**: Manual workers earning middle-level incomes
- **Question**: Do affluent workers adopt middle class attitudes and lifestyles when earning similar income levels?
- **Finding**: Affluent workers remained quite different from white-collar workers in terms of attitudes and orientation
- **But**: They also differed significantly from traditional manual workers

### DANIEL BELL's Characterization

- **Western Society in 20th Century**: Characterized as middle class society
- **Reason**: Bulk of population lies in middle income levels, engaged in managerial and professional occupations

## POVERTY (110:52)

### Definition According to World Bank

- **Poverty**: State of pronounced deprivation in well-being
- **Components**: 
  - Low income
  - Inability to acquire goods and services required for survival with dignity

#### World Bank's Poetic Definition

- "Poverty is hunger and lack of shelter"
- "Poverty is being sick and not being able to see a doctor"  
- "Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read"

### Types of Poverty

#### Absolute Poverty

- **Definition**: A certain basket of goods and services identified as necessary for survival
- **Process**: Translated into money terms; those whose consumption expenditure is below that amount are deemed poor
- **Example - India's BPL Line (TENDULKAR Committee)**:
  - **Rural Areas**: 2400 kilocalories per capita per day = ₹27 per capita per day
  - **Urban Areas**: 2100 kilocalories per capita per day = ₹33 per capita per day
- **Result**: 21.9% of India's population classified as poor

#### Relative Poverty

- **Definition**: Basket of goods and services keeps changing with changes in level of socioeconomic development
- **Logic**: Expectations change as society becomes more developed
- **Example**: Basic necessities may expand to include internet, hot running water, etc.

### Criticism of Absolute Poverty Measures

- **Major Critique**: These lines were criticized as starvation lines, not poverty lines
- **Inadequacy**: ₹33 per day in urban areas (approximately ₹1000 per month) includes food, clothing, footwear, electricity, education, transportation - everything
- **Controversy**: Planning Commission spent ₹30 lakh on toilet construction while expecting poor to survive on ₹33 per day

### Varying Estimates of Poverty in India

| Committee/Organization       | Poverty Estimate     | Key Details                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **TENDULKAR Committee**      | 21.9%                | Official BPL line based                                            |
| **RANGARAJAN Committee**     | 29.5%                | Alternative methodology                                            |
| **N.C. SAXENA Committee**    | 50%                  | Higher threshold approach                                          |
| **ARJUN SENGUPTA Committee** | 77%                  | Living on less than ₹20 per day, classified as poor and vulnerable |
| **NITI AAYOG**               | 322.5 million people | Multidimensionally poor (approximately 25% of population)          |

## THEORIES OF POVERTY (137:57)

### Subcultural Theory of Poverty

#### OSCAR LEWIS - Main Proponent

- **Core Argument**: The poor have a distinctive subculture that perpetuates poverty
- **Subculture of Poverty Includes**:
  - **Laziness**: Lack of work ethic
  - **Fatalistic Attitude**: Relying on faith rather than effort
  - **Absence of Saving Habit**: Immediate consumption pattern
  - **Belief in Instant Gratification**: No future planning
  - **Helplessness**: Lack of agency
  - **Lack of Ambition**: No drive or aspiration

#### Intergenerational Transmission

- **Process**: Poor children learn these attitudes from poor parents
- **Example**: Child sees father drinking and not working, learns similar behavior
- **Result**: Poverty passed down through generations via cultural transmission

### Situational Constraints Theory

#### Key Proponents: LEIBOW and Others

- **Strong Critique**: Of subcultural theory of poverty
- **Core Argument**: The poor do not have a distinctive subculture
- **Alternative Explanation**: Their behavior is a logical response to constraints imposed by their situation

#### Logical Response Analysis

- **Middle Class Logic**: Save ₹15,000 from ₹50,000 monthly income because in 20 years, will own property
- **Poor's Logic**: Equally logical to spend extra money immediately because small amounts won't make material difference to prosperity level
- **Future Orientation Difference**: 
  - Middle class and rich have future orientation because they have a future to look forward to
  - Poor don't plan for future because they don't really have a future to plan for

### Vicious Circle Theory of Poverty

#### Key Proponents: GUNNAR MYRDAL, NURKSE

- **Core Concept**: "The poor are poor because they are poor"
- **Mechanism**: Poor are stuck in a vicious cycle where poverty breeds poverty

#### Examples of Vicious Cycles

**Education Cycle**:

- Born in poor family → Can't afford good education → Remain uneducated/poorly educated → Can't concentrate on studies due to financial burden → Poor grades → Dropout → Children born poor → Cycle continues

**Health Cycle**:

- Born poor → Lack access to clean water, sanitation, wholesome food → Poor mental and physical development → More illness → Lower productivity → Low income → Poverty continues

### Functional Theory of Poverty

#### HERBERT GANS - Main Proponent

- **Core Argument**: Poverty exists in various parts of world because it performs some functions and benefits society

#### Functions Served by Poverty

1. **Dirty and Menial Tasks**: Ensures that dirty, dangerous, and low-status work gets done
2. **Industry Support**: Many industries and occupations thrive on poverty (hospitals need people to clean blood and waste; restaurants need dishwashers)
3. **Middle Class Occupations**: NGO sector, government departments dealing with poverty depend on poor for employment
4. **Self-Worth Assurance**: Existence of poverty assures non-poor of their self-worth - serves as baseline of failure

#### Examples

- **Mother Teresa**: Called "glamour girl of poverty" - built career serving poor
- **Psychological Function**: When lower-level clerk or driver sees beggars on street, feels better about own situation

### Marxist Theory of Poverty

#### Core Arguments

- **Poverty as Extreme Inequality**: Poverty is only an extreme manifestation of inequality, which is characteristic feature of capitalist society
- **Wealth-Poverty Relationship**: "Poverty exists because wealth exists" - some are poor because some are rich
- **Class Interest**: Poverty serves class interest of bourgeoisie

#### Marxist Mechanisms

- **Reserve Army of Labor**: Poor constitute vast pool of labor that can be tapped whenever capitalist requires
- **Wage Suppression**: Helps capitalist keep wages down - if workers ask for raise, can hire from poor population
- **LUMPENPROLETARIAT**: MARX's term for the poor, including prostitutes, drug addicts, homeless, chronically unemployed, vagabonds

#### Lumpenproletariat Characteristics

- **Mercenary Character**: Driven by money, no principles
- **Untrustworthiness**: Cannot be trusted by proletariat in revolution
- **Bourgeois Agents**: Serve as agents of bourgeoisie, weaken class consciousness

#### Marxist Solution

- **Only Solution**: Communism
- **Impossibility in Capitalism**: Poverty can never be wiped out in capitalist society, no matter how rich it becomes
- **Vested Interest**: Capitalists have vested interest in perpetuation of poverty
