# G.H. MEAD: Self and Identity

## RECAP: WEBER'S BUREAUCRACY (13:56)

- **Bureaucracy Definition**: A hierarchical organization where large scale tasks are divided into smaller parts to achieve organizational goals

- **Features of Weberian Bureaucracy**:
  
  - **Hierarchical Model**: Top-most officers connected to lower-most through two-way communication structure where commands flow from top to bottom and feedback flows from bottom to top
  - **Division of Labor**: Large tasks divided into smaller and manageable tasks with officials assigned specific roles
  - **Written Rules**: Abstract rules govern the organization
  - **Separation of Resources**: Income and resources of officials are separated from that of the organization
  - **Full-time Paid Career**: Officials work as full-time paid professionals

- **Weber's Assessment**: Technically superior to any other form of organization due to efficiency, accountability, minimizing discretion, rationality, predictability, high speed, and control mechanisms

- **Flaws in Bureaucracy**:
  
  - **Misuse of Power**: Can lead to abuse of authority
  - **Iron Cage**: Result of rationalization in society creating irrational manifestations where officials lose emotional and social connections
  - **Goal Displacement**: MERTON argued that people start emphasizing more on rules than goals
  - **Deviation Benefits**: PETER BLAU suggested deviation from formal rules can actually enhance organizational efficiency
  - **Environmental Limitations**: BURNS AND STALKER noted it's not suited for all types of environments - stable environments suit bureaucratic organization, dynamic environments require organic structures
  - **Task Dependency**: ALVIN GOULDNER emphasized suitability depends on nature of the task
  - **Interpersonal Friction**: Impersonal conduct can create friction between bureaucracy and people
  - **Societal Prejudices**: Bureaucratic decision-making mirrors prejudices present in wider society
  - **Organizational Persistence**: WARREN BENNIS predicted bureaucracy would be replaced by temporary working systems, but organizations continue expanding even when outdated

## INTRODUCTION TO G.H. MEAD (57:22)

- **G.H. MEAD**: American psychologist and sociologist
- **Recognition**: Regarded as one of the founders of **Symbolic Interactionist Approach**
- **Institutional Affiliation**: Prominent member of the **Chicago School**
- **UPSC Syllabus Topic**: Self and Identity
- **Major Work**: Students compiled his notes into book titled **"Mind, Self and Society"** (Mead never authored a complete book himself)

## CONCEPT OF SELF (53:45)

### Understanding Self Through Exercise

- **Self Definition**: The ability that humans possess to view and assess one's own person as if from the outside
- **Reflexive Nature**: Self is reflexive, meaning it can reflect upon itself
- **Key Characteristic**: Self is the ability of human beings to reflect upon their own thoughts and deeds as if for a third person

### Unique Human Ability

- **Inanimate Objects**: Do not have self-concept
- **Lower Animals**: Do not possess self-concept  
- **Body Parts**: Individual body parts do not have self-concept
- **Human Infants**: Not born with self-concept
- **Development**: Self-concept is acquired during the process of **socialization**

### Self as Subject and Object

- **Dual Nature**: Self is both the object and the subject
- **Subject**: The one who is speaking/thinking
- **Object**: The one being spoken about/thought about
- **Example**: When reflecting on oneself, the person is simultaneously the observer and the observed

## STAGES OF SELF DEVELOPMENT (80:27)

### Stage 1: Preparatory Stage (Birth to 2-3 years)

- **Primary Activity**: Infants begin to imitate the gestures of those around them
- **Key Limitation**: Children simply imitate gestures without attaching any meaning
- **Examples**: 
  - If you smile at them, they smile back
  - If you make a grimace, they also make a grimace
  - They copy "who" sounds and other expressions
- **Difference from Adults**: Same facial expressions by infant vs adult carry different significance - children do not understand meaning behind gestures

### Stage 2: Play Stage (2-3 years to 5-6 years)

- **Primary Activity**: Child starts engaging in play by taking up the role of a **Significant Other**
- **Significant Others**: Persons who are very important in the life of the child
  - **Most Important**: Mother
  - **Second**: Father (distant second in most cultures)
  - **Others**: Grandmother, grandfather, uncle, siblings, house help, doctor
- **Play-Acting Examples**:
  - Child plays being a mother - feeds doll, scolds it, mimics maternal behavior
  - Child plays being a doctor - uses stethoscope, examines patients
  - Child plays being a cop or other authority figures
- **Self-Concept Status**: Child has not yet developed self-concept and cannot see himself from outside
- **Partial Development**: Child develops ability to evaluate others but not self

### Stage 3: Game Stage (5-6 years onwards)

- **Primary Activity**: Children start playing complex games involving other players and rules
- **Game Examples**: 
  - **Cricket**: Different roles (batsman, bowler, wicket keeper, fielders) with numerous rules
  - **Hide and Seek**: Den, hiders, specific rules about freezing when caught
  - **Chor-Police**: Different roles and rule structures
- **Requirements for Complex Games**:
  - Understanding various roles that different players adopt
  - Knowledge of rules of the game
  - Ability to coordinate with multiple participants

### Development of Generalized Other

- **Generalized Other Definition**: Combination of social roles organized according to rules
- **Formation**: During game stage, child develops concept of generalized other
- **Perspective Shift**: Child begins to see himself from perspective of generalized other
- **Examples of Generalized Others**:
  - Team members during cricket match
  - Other players in any group game
  - Broader society expectations

### Achievement of Selfhood

- **Critical Milestone**: Child attains selfhood during the game stage
- **Self-Awareness**: Becomes self-aware and self-conscious
- **External Perspective**: Develops ability to see oneself as if from outside
- **Question Formation**: Begins thinking "What will others think?" or "How do others see me?"

## EVOLUTION OF SELF-CONCEPT (96:31)

### Dynamic Nature of Self

- **Not Static**: Self-concept is not static, it is greatly dynamic
- **Continuous Change**: It changes and keeps on changing with time throughout our lives
- **Evolution Process**: Self-concept continuously evolves through social interaction situations

### Role-Taking Process

- **Mechanism**: Self-concept evolves through the process of **role-taking**
- **Role-Taking Definition**: In any interaction situation, the actor will take up the role of the counter-actors to assess his own role performance and to gauge how the counter-actors view the actor
- **Practical Application**: 
  - Teacher takes role of student to gauge own teaching performance
  - Individual takes role of wife to assess performance as husband
  - Person takes role of father to evaluate performance as son

### Formation Through Interaction

- **Input Reception**: Individuals receive input from social interactions which becomes part of self-concept
- **Interpretation Key**: Self-concept is not what others think of us, but what we think others think of us
- **Misreading Possibility**: People often misread what others actually think about them
- **Continuous Process**: Social interaction continues throughout life, so self-concept keeps evolving

## SYMBOLIC INTERACTIONISM (127:09)

### Communication Types

**Unconscious Communication**:

- **Method**: Takes place through exchange of gestures
- **Scope**: Present even among lower animals  
- **Nature**: Any bodily movement can be a gesture
- **Examples**: Body language, unintended signals, subtle behavioral cues

**Conscious Communication**:

- **Exclusivity**: Takes place only among human beings
- **Method**: Through exchange of **significant symbols**
- **Language Role**: Language is a set of shared significant symbols
- **Requirements**: Symbols must be shared and carry meaning for both sender and recipient

### Significant Symbols

- **Definition**: A gesture becomes a significant symbol when it evokes in the individual making it the same response that it intends to evoke in the person towards whom it is directed
- **Examples**: 
  - Word "apple" refers to the red fruit for both speaker and listener
  - Hand gestures like waving "hello" understood by both parties
  - Alphabet letters (A for Apple, B for Ball) as shared symbols

### Core Principles of Symbolic Interactionism

1. **Meaning-Based Action**: Social actors act towards things on the basis of meanings attached to them
2. **Social Origin of Meaning**: Meanings that people attach to things are a result of social interaction  
3. **Modifiable Meanings**: Meanings attached to things need not be fixed - they can be modified and reinterpreted in social interaction situations

### Theoretical Framework

- **Term Origin**: "Symbolic Interactionism" was coined by HERBERT BLUMER (Mead's student) to refer to Mead's philosophy
- **Self as Social Emergent**: According to symbolic interactionist approach, the self is a social emergent
- **Development Timing**: The idea of self develops during the game stage of socialization when child becomes self-aware
- **Language Importance**: Language enables people to share their views, opinions, etc., and plays a central role in conscious communication

## COMPONENTS OF SELF: THE "I" AND "ME" (140:26)

### The "Me" Component

- **Definition**: Represents the accumulated understanding of various generalized others of the individual
- **Content**: Set of attitudes of others which is internalized by the individual in his self-concept
- **Social Representation**: The "Me" represents society inside the individual
- **Control Mechanism**: Represents an aspect of control of society over the individual internalized in his self-concept
- **Cultural Reference**: In Hindi, often referred to as "char log kya kahenge" (what will four people say)
- **Societal Expectations**: Society expects certain things based on:
  - Age, gender, class, caste, religion, sexuality
  - Social roles (father, teacher, professional, etc.)

### The "I" Component

- **Definition**: Represents the novel response of the individual to the demands and expectations of society
- **Characteristics**: 
  - **Assertive**: Stands up against social pressure
  - **Impulsive**: Acts spontaneously  
  - **Unpredictable**: Cannot be predicted in advance
- **Expression**: "I am like this only" attitude, regardless of social norms
- **Timing**: Only known after it has been expressed
- **Individual Agency**: Represents personal autonomy against social conformity

### Relationship Between Components

- **Me Function**: Makes the individual conformist
- **I Function**: Pulls the individual towards non-conformity  
- **Balance**: Every individual has both components in varying degrees
- **Uniqueness**: What makes each person unique is the I component of self

## MIND AND THINKING (151:50)

### Mead's Conception of Mind

- **Mind Definition**: According to MEAD, mind refers to the process of thinking
- **Thinking Process**: Having an inner conversation
- **Conversation Requirements**: Need two entities between which exchange can take place
- **Inner Dialogue**: Thinking is a conversation between the "Me" and "I" components of self

### Relationship: Mind, Self, and Society

**Conventional Understanding**:

- Individual has mind → develops self-concept through thinking → different selves interact to constitute society

**Mead's Reversal**:

- **Sequence**: Social interactions → self emerges → thinking becomes possible
- **Self Necessity**: Self is necessary for thinking (cannot think without self-concept)
- **Self Origin**: Self emerges out of social interactions
- **Process Nature**: Self is a process rather than a product - always evolving, never assumes final form

## LOOKING GLASS SELF (105:32)

### C.H. Cooley's Concept

- **Theorist**: C.H. COOLEY (related psychologist)
- **Core Idea**: "Each to the other is a looking glass self"
- **Meaning**: Every person serves as a mirror for others
- **Reflection Process**: Each person sees their reflection in others' eyes
- **Self-Formation**: We form our self-concepts based on how we perceive others view us

### Application Examples

- **Teacher-Student**: Teacher sees teaching quality reflected in students' responses
- **Peer Relationships**: Students see themselves reflected in colleagues' attitudes  
- **Family Dynamics**: Self-concept formed through family members' perceived opinions
- **Professional Identity**: Work performance assessed through perceived colleague feedback

## CONTRIBUTIONS AND CRITICISMS (159:05)

### Major Contributions

1. **Pioneer Status**: One of the pioneers of symbolic interactionist approach along with C.H. COOLEY and JOHN DEWEY
2. **Powerful Critique**: Symbolic interactionist approach emerged as powerful critique of macro approaches in sociology and positivist tradition
3. **Influential Teaching**: Trained some of greatest minds in symbolic interactionist tradition including HERBERT BLUMER
4. **Enduring Legacy**: Concept of self developed by MEAD continues to be basis of symbolic interactionist approach and writings till today
5. **Interdisciplinary Impact**: Writings influenced not only sociology but also psychology, bringing the two disciplines closer together

### Major Criticisms

1. **Over-Individualization**: 
   
   - **Structuralist Critique**: Criticized for over-emphasizing the individual
   - **Consequence**: Down-playing the role of social or structural factors

2. **Disciplinary Ambiguity**:
   
   - **Bridge Attempt**: Tried to bridge gap between sociology and psychology
   - **Result**: Could not do justice to either discipline

3. **Communication Hierarchy Error**:
   
   - **Mead's Position**: Conscious communication is far more important than unconscious communication
   - **Critics' Counter**: Unconscious communication is extremely important, possibly more important than conscious communication
   - **Evidence**: Body language experts suggest fate in interviews decided within first 40-50 seconds based on unconscious cues

4. **Excessive Social Determinism**:
   
   - **Mead's View**: Self is almost entirely a social emergent/product of social interactions
   - **Missing Elements**: Ignores role of biological and genetic factors in self-formation
   - **Question**: Do biological factors affect our sense of self?
