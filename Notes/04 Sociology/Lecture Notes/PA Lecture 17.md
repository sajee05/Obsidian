## RECAP: MANIFEST AND LATENT FUNCTIONS (21:37)

- **Manifest Functions**: Positive consequences that are recognized and intended by the participants
- **Latent Functions**: Positive consequences which are neither intended nor recognized by the participants
- **MERTON's Critique of Classical Functionalism**: He attacked certain assumptions made by classical functionalists, particularly **MALINOWSKI** and **RADCLIFFE-BROWN**

### The Postulate of Universal Functionalism

- **First Assumption Attacked**: The postulate of universal functionalism
- **Classical View**: Every social phenomena are positive or functional for the whole society
- **MERTON's Contention**: Some functions might have a positive effect for certain social groups within the society but for others they might have a negative consequence or no consequence
  - Negative consequences = **Dysfunctionalism**
  - No consequence = **Nonfunctionalism**

### Examples of Manifest and Latent Functions

**HOPI Indian Rain Dance:**

- **Manifest Function**: To bring rain
- **Latent Function**: Solidarity of the group which was reinforced

**HOLI Celebrations:**

- **Manifest Functions**: Enjoyment, celebration
- **Latent Functions**: Group solidarity is reinforced
- **Manifest Dysfunctions**: Wastage of water
- **Latent Dysfunctions**: Eve teasing, harassment, domestic violence, riots, adverse consequences for skin, harm to animals

**Education/Sending Children to School:**

- **Manifest Functions**: For them to acquire knowledge and education
- **Latent Functions**: 
  - Parents get free time (they get a breather)
  - Children develop friendships
  - Inculcates sense of discipline in children
  - Children learn to adhere to rules and regulations

### Key Terminology

- **Latent Functions/Dysfunctions in Normal English**: Side effects, spin-offs
- **Relevance**: Helps overcome ethnocentric biases, provides sociological understanding beyond ordinary perception

## REFERENCE GROUPS AND ANTICIPATORY SOCIALIZATION (33:44)

- **Reference Group**: A type of group from which a person seeks social validation
- **Types**: 
  - Membership group can be a reference group
  - Non-membership group can also be a reference group
- **Term Coined by**: HERBERT HYMAN and further developed by MUZAFER SHARIF and MERTON

### Anticipatory Socialization

- **Definition**: The process of preparing oneself for entering into a non-membership reference group by adopting its norms, values and lifestyle
- **Comparison**: Reference group is like a group equivalent of a role model
  - Single person = Role model (e.g., AMITABH BACHCHAN, SACHIN TENDULKAR)
  - Group = Reference group (e.g., film stars, cricketers)

### Examples of Reference Groups

- **Membership Groups**: Family, friends, colleagues
- **Non-membership Groups**: 
  - College groups with different characteristics (mixed gender vs same gender)
  - Groups speaking different languages (English vs native tongue)
  - Groups with different musical preferences (rock music vs Bangla/Ghazals)

### Functional Aspects of Anticipatory Socialization

**Benefits:**

1. **Enhances chances of getting entry** into the non-membership reference group
2. **Eases adjustment** in the group after having joined it

**Dysfunctional Aspects:**

- **No guarantee** that the non-membership reference group will accept you
- Individual may get **alienated from membership group** while still not accepted by non-membership reference group
- **Result**: Ending up as a **marginal man**

## RELATIVE DEPRIVATION (53:40)

- **Definition**: Persons see themselves as deprived or privileged by comparing their own situation with that of other groups of people
- **Key Principle**: To what extent one feels deprived or satisfied depends on who one compares oneself with
- **Developed by**: SAMUEL STOUFFER in his study titled **"The American Soldier"**

### STOUFFER's Findings

- **Married American soldiers** felt relative deprivation when they compared their situation with:
  1. **Unmarried soldiers**: Because unmarried soldiers don't have same responsibilities, enjoy more freedom, have carefree life
  2. **Married civilians**: Because these people have opportunity to fulfill obligations, enjoy healthy married life and normal routine family life

### Illustrative Quote (attributed to MARX)

> "A house may be big or small. As long as nearby houses are similar, it meets all of one's requirements. But let there arise a palace in front of one's modest house, and the modest house shrinks to a hut."

### RUNCIMAN's Four Conditions for Relative Deprivation

For person A to experience relative deprivation for object X:

1. **A does not have X**
2. **A wants to have X**
3. **A knows another person B who has X**
4. **A thinks that attaining X is realistically possible**

## REFERENCE GROUP SELECTION PROCESS (1:10:06)

- **Complexity**: Reference group selection is a very complex process
- **Multiple Groups**: An individual chooses different reference groups during different phases of life
- **Simultaneous Groups**: Even at a particular time, one may have a number of reference groups for different aspects

### Conflicting Demands

- **Nature**: Different reference groups may impose conflicting demands on the individual
- **Example**: Looking up to models/film stars (requires gym time) vs civil servants (requires library time)
- **Management**: The individual mostly manages to balance, prioritize and compartmentalize these expectations

### Positive and Negative Reference Groups

| Type                          | Definition                                 | Behavior Pattern                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Positive Reference Groups** | Those which you aspire to join, look up to | Use their norms, values and lifestyle to mold conduct |
| **Negative Reference Groups** | Those whose membership you want to avoid   | Develop counter-norms, do opposite of what they do    |

### Why Choose Non-membership Groups as Reference Groups?

**Reasons:**

1. **Expected to confer greater power and prestige** on the individual
2. **More likely in open social systems** which permit social mobility than in closed systems
3. **Individual is acutely aware** of norms, values, demands, concerns and expectations of membership groups
4. **Not fully aware** of demands and expectations of non-membership groups
5. **Non-membership groups may appear more attractive** from outside than what they really are
6. **Social isolates** who are not satisfied with position assigned to them in membership groups are more likely to have non-membership groups as reference groups

## MERTON'S THEORY OF DEVIANCE (1:49:46)

- **Deviance**: Refers to those acts which do not conform to the norms and expectations of the society, exceeds the tolerance limits of the society and invite negative sanctions

### Broader vs Specific Understanding

**Broader Understanding** includes:

- Acts positively sanctioned/rewarded by society (revolutionaries, scientists)
- Acts negatively sanctioned/punished by society
- Acts not sanctioned/ignored by society

**MARSHALL CLINARD's Suggestion**: Term deviance should be reserved for those acts which are disapproved and beyond tolerance limits of society

### Characteristics of Deviance

- **Culture Specific**: What is regarded as deviance varies from society to society
- **Time Specific**: What is regarded as deviance in a given society may also change with time
- **Not Numbers-based**: Depends on societal reaction, not on how many people engage in the behavior

### Popular Forms of Deviance

- Homosexuality
- Drug addiction
- Crime
- Juvenile delinquency
- Alcoholism

### Explanations of Deviant Behavior

**Physiological Theories (LOMBROSO):**

- Certain people have biological makeup predisposing them to crime
- "Born criminal" concept
- Criminals have outward markers distinguishing them
- **Status**: Regarded as outdated and racist

**Psychological Explanations:**

- Something different in the brain of deviant person
- Usually due to childhood trauma
- Suppressed experiences later express as deviant behavior

## MERTON'S SOCIOLOGICAL EXPLANATION (2:25:46)

- **Core Argument**: Deviance is an outcome of the structure and culture of the society
- **Analysis Focus**: American society specifically

### American Society Structure

**Culturally Approved Goals:**

- Accumulation of wealth
- Financial success
- American Dream of "making it big"

**Institutionalized Means:**

- Entrepreneurship
- Education
- Honing talents
- Skill development
- Hard work

### The Problem: ANOMIE

- **Greater emphasis** on goals than on means
- **All members** have internalized the culturally approved goal of becoming rich
- **Unequal access** to institutionalized means
- **Result**: Discrepancy between culturally defined goals and institutionalized means available to achieve them
- **Definition of ANOMIE**: A situation in which there is a discrepancy between the culturally defined goals and the institutionalized means available to achieve them

### Five Types of Responses to ANOMIE

| Response Type     | Goals   | Means   | Description                                                                       | Typical Class                                    |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Conformity** | Accept  | Accept  | Try to achieve culturally approved goals using institutionalized means            | Most common response                             |
| **2. Innovation** | Accept  | Reject  | Try to achieve goals but not through institutionalized means (e.g., thieves)      | Lower class more likely                          |
| **3. Ritualism**  | Reject  | Accept  | Follow institutionalized means but give up hope of achieving goals                | Lower middle class (bureaucrats)                 |
| **4. Retreatism** | Reject  | Reject  | Give up on both goals and means, drop out of society (drug addicts, alcoholics)   | Any class                                        |
| **5. Rebellion**  | Replace | Replace | Reject both culturally approved goals and means, replace with new goals and means | Rising class, terrorist organizations, Naxalites |

### Key Observations

- **Most Common Response**: Conformity
- **Lower Class Tendency**: More likely to innovate due to blocked access to institutionalized means
- **Ritualism**: Called so because people keep following means like a ritual without applying mind
- **Rebellion**: Usually members of rising class who can stake claim to throne in new setup
