# Political System: Caste, Communalism and Reservation Policies in India

## Opening Session and Prayer (04:39)

- Hello friends, online students, please confirm that I am audible
- Let us close our eyes for a moment and begin with prayer
- Multiple "Om" chants were conducted to start the session

## Communalism and Role of Caste in Indian Politics (06:22)

### Definition of Communalism

- **Communalism**: As defined by BIPIN CHANDRA - an ideology that seeks to protect and promote a certain religious intercommunity interest and benefits through political mobilization
- Religious community dominates another in communal politics
- It involves political mobilization based on religious identity

### Theories and Explanations of Communal Riots

**Pre-Colonial Theory:**

- Even before colonial rule, there was some sort of religious identity being involved in the political administrative system
- Example: Brahmins were used in divine theory of kingship during ancient period

**PAUL BRASS Theory:**

- He compares communal riots to street theater
- Meaning: They are pre-planned, thought out, and organized events
- Riots are orchestrated rather than spontaneous

**ASHUTOSH VARSHNEY's Contribution:**

- Collected data regarding communal riots post-independence for several decades
- Found that cities are particularly riot-prone
- **Key Finding**: If a city has separate civil society organizations of Hindus and Muslims, then there is greater likelihood of rioting taking place
- Conversely, integrated civil society organizations prevent riots

**SAMUEL HUNTINGTON's Theory:**

- Argues that Hindu and Muslim cultures are mutually incompatible
- Blames Muslims for differences and riots

### Caste Dynamics in Politics

**Horizontal Stretch of Caste (M.N. SRINIVAS concept):**

- Different sub-castes come under one umbrella category for secular benefits
- Example: Various castes uniting for reservation benefits

**Vote Bank Politics (M.N. SRINIVAS concept):**

- When a particular community votes for a particular leader and party in a block
- Creates patron-client relationships where patrons enjoy clout over the political behavior of service providers

### Contemporary Issues

**Secular State and Hindu Temples:**

- Question raised: Is secular state control over Hindu temples bad for Hinduism?
- Right-wing argument: Secular state takes away wealth of Hindu temples while not doing so with mosques and churches
- Counter-argument (MEHTA): It is for the benefit of Hindu community as it prevents misuse of funds and ensures accountability

## OBC Mobilization in Northern India (15:48)

### Early Beginnings (Early 20th Century)

**Initial Resistance:**

- OBC castes like YADAVS and KURMIS in UP and Bihar started refusing to sell milk, curd, and cow dung to upper castes at concessional rates
- They also began sanskritizing themselves
- This was due to colonial policies breaking down the jajmani system and market economy becoming more salient

### Post-Independence Developments

**Two Major Factors:**

1. **Land Reforms**: Some OBC castes were able to benefit from these
2. **Green Revolution**: Certain OBC castes gained economically

**Key Scholars: RUDOLPH AND RUDOLPH**

- In their book "IN PURSUIT OF LAKSHMI", they discussed how certain OBC castes benefited from land reforms and green revolution
- These communities then started establishing regional parties as their political aspirations were not being fulfilled within the Congress fold

### Formation of Regional Parties

- OBC castes formed various caste-based associations
- These associations undertook social reforms as well as struggle for political power
- Regional outfits floated by OBC castes began to displace Congress from state governments

### Political Pinnacle: Janata Party Government

**After Emergency (1977):**

- The Janata Party government was an amalgam of various regional and anti-Congress parties
- Many of these were OBC parties
- This represented the pinnacle of OBC political power initially

**Post-Janata Government Realization:**

- OBCs had economic power and numerical strength
- They had captured political power
- But they lacked administrative power - their children were not in civil services or highly valued government jobs

## The Mandal Commission and Its Implementation (22:53)

### Establishment and Report

**Formation (1979):**

- Mandal Commission was set up by Janata Party government in 1979
- Under chairmanship of **B.P. MANDAL**
- Submitted its report in 1980

**Timeline Issues:**

- By the time it submitted report, Janata Party government had given way to Congress again
- Congress led by INDIRA GANDHI put the report in cold storage
- Report was implemented a decade later in 1990 by **V.P. SINGH government**

### Implementation and Protests (1990)

**Widespread Opposition:**

- Implementation witnessed wide spread protests and agitations by upper caste students
- **RAJIV GOSWAMI** put himself on fire near AIIMS in Delhi
- This photograph captured the angst of upper castes against Mandal implementation

**Mandal Recommendations:**

- Recommended 27% reservation in public sector employment, civil services, PSU jobs for OBCs

### CHRISTOPHE JAFFRELOT's Analysis

**"India's Silent Revolution":**

- Termed the rise of OBCs as India's silent revolution
- Led to sociopolitical process which contributed to social emancipation of lower castes at the expense of upper castes
- Resulted in lower castes' rise to political power

**Statistical Evidence:**

- 1984: Only 11% MPs were OBCs
- 1990: Risen to 20%
- 2004: Increased to 25%
- Corresponding decline in upper caste representation from 47% (1984) to 33% (2004)

### Limitations of OBC Success

**Victims of Their Own Success:**

1. Supreme Court capped total reservations at 50%
2. Only some castes like JATS were able to benefit while many others could not
3. Led to counter-revolution - the Hindutva wave (Mandal vs Kamandal)

## Detailed Analysis of Reservation Policy (34:16)

### Types of Reservation

**Three Categories:**

1. **SC/ST Reservations**: In force since Constitution came into effect, largely uncontested
2. **OBC Reservations**: Implemented by V.P. SINGH government, highly divisive
3. **EWS Reservations**: Brought by MODI government, recently begun

### Arguments Against Caste-Based OBC Reservation

#### Merit-Based Arguments

**Core Argument:**

- Reservation policy compromises merit
- It rewards the less meritorious and takes opportunities away from the more meritorious
- Example cited: Student with 96% denied admission while 77% scoring student gets admission

**Impact on Motivation:**

- Highly demotivating for hardworking, diligent students
- Appears very unjust and unfair
- Creates reverse discrimination

#### Constitutional Concerns

**Equality Arguments:**

- Violates constitutional promise of equality before law
- Goes against equal protection of laws irrespective of caste
- Present generation being punished for sins of ancestors
- Constitutes reverse discrimination against upper castes

#### Administrative Efficiency Concerns

**Quality Compromise:**

- Working of government machinery is compromised
- Less capable preferred over those with proven capabilities
- Will hurt national development in long run
- Administrative efficiency plays important role in national development

#### Perpetuation of Caste System

**IP DESAI's Argument:**

- With reservation, the state is legitimizing caste
- Constitution promises equality and envisions caste-free society
- As long as caste-based reservation exists, constitutional ideals can never be achieved
- Modern progressive society cannot be established by keeping caste alive

#### Practical Implementation Issues

**Creamy Layer Problems:**

- Benefits cornered by better-off OBC families
- Genuine backward communities unable to benefit
- Creamy layer criteria easily violated
- Rich privileged OBCs are real beneficiaries

**Limited Scope:**

- Government jobs are very limited (approximately 50,000-80,000 annually)
- Cannot address problems of 65 crore OBC population
- Like a drop in the ocean

**Hereditary Nature:**

- Once granted, reservation benefits cannot be taken back
- Becomes political suicide for any party
- No mechanism to remove castes from OBC list

### Expanding Demands for Reservation

**Ever-Increasing Scope:**

- Demands for reservation in private sector
- Would adversely affect global competitiveness
- Drive away FDI
- Make India globally less competitive

**Question of Limits:**

- Should there be reservation in sports? (Cricket team should have proportionate representation)
- In arts and Bollywood?
- In medical field and surgery?
- In judiciary?
- Where do we draw the line?

**PANDORA'S Box Effect:**

- Ever-widening ambit and ever-increasing demands
- What was meant to be temporary has become permanent crutches
- Preventing backward communities from standing on their feet

### Race for Backwardness

**Supreme Court Observation:**

- In India, different communities compete to claim they are more backward than others
- Generally, one would expect betterment over time
- But the list of backward castes has only expanded, not shrunk
- More communities demand OBC tag

## Arguments in Favor of Caste-Based Reservation (100:48)

### Proportional Representation Arguments

**Population vs Benefits:**

- OBCs constitute 52% of population (as per MANDAL estimate)
- But receive only 27% reservation
- Even getting less than their population ratio

**Current Underrepresentation:**

- Only 8% of Group A and Group B employees in Indian Railways are OBC
- Zero OBC professors in 40 central universities (UGC data)
- Only 14% OBC assistant professors
- Only 12% judges in lower judiciary are OBC
- 62% students dropping out of IIMs are SC/ST/OBCs

### Constitutional and Legal Justification

**Supreme Court Validation (INDIRA SAHNI case):**

- Supreme Court stated that in Indian context, some castes can be rightly identified as socially and educationally backward classes
- Constitution allows state to take action for social justice

**AMBEDKAR's Definition:**

- AMBEDKAR defined caste as an enclosed class
- Certain castes can be identified as socially and educationally backward classes

### The Merit Argument Rebuttal

**Understanding Merit:**

- Merit is not solely based on person's mental faculties or intelligence and effort
- It is also greatly affected by social and environmental factors
- Performance in competitive exams affected by factors other than hard work and ability

**Social and Cultural Capital:**

- Lower caste communities often lack social and cultural capital
- Insufficient emphasis on importance of education
- Upper caste families have long tradition of knowledge acquisition
- Even poor Brahmin families emphasize education importance

**Environmental Advantages:**

- Access to fancy private tuitions with guaranteed results
- Air-conditioned study environments
- Educational support from educated parents
- First-generation educated persons face much more difficulty

### Equality Principle Clarification

**Constitutional Understanding:**

- Constitution talks about equality in two senses: equality before law and equal protection of laws
- Not mechanical equality

**MANDAL Commission Report Quote:**

- "There is equality only among equals"
- "To equate unequals is to perpetuate inequality"

**True Equality Concept:**

- Equality exists only between equals
- To ensure equality, unequals need to be treated unequally
- Those differently placed in society need to be treated differently
- Historically disadvantaged need that head start

### Caste Reality Arguments

**Caste Already Exists:**

- Not reservation policy that keeps caste alive - caste is anyway alive and kicking
- 95% marriages are within caste
- No reservation in marriage, yet caste consciousness persists
- Public policy must be mindful of social realities

**Policy Acknowledgment:**

- Caste-based reservation policy only acknowledges social reality of caste
- As long as caste exists in society, there is legitimate case for caste-based reservation

### Research Evidence

**ASHWINI DESHPANDE Study:**

- Large-scale study from 1980-2002 on impact of SC reservation on efficiency in Indian Railways
- Found no decline in administrative efficiency due to reservation
- In some areas, efficiency actually improved

**Reason for Improved Efficiency:**

- Those getting jobs through reservation are under continuous pressure to prove their worth
- They strive harder than general category candidates
- General category candidates may relax after proving themselves

### Implementation Response

**Addressing Criticisms:**

- Outdated data criticism is well acknowledged
- Proponents demand caste-based census for policy updates
- Need better implementation of creamy layer criteria rather than abandoning policy
- Plug loopholes to prevent misuse

## Purpose and Impact of Reservation Policy (146:54)

### Primary Objective: Social Justice

**Not Economic Improvement:**

- Purpose is not to improve economic conditions of people
- Not a job guarantee scheme (MGNREGA exists for economic relief)
- Main purpose is social justice

**Social Justice Definition:**

- Those communities unable to participate in education and political-administrative system due to accumulated historical disadvantages
- Address their underrepresentation and improve their participation

### Positive Impact Analysis

**S.S. JODHKA's Assessment:**

- Reservation on the whole had positive impact on Indian society
- Developed a stake for the marginalized in the prevailing economic, political and educational system

**Inspirational Effect:**

- Even if handful of people from marginalized communities become part of the system, they serve as inspiration
- They serve as beacons of hope, symbols of empowerment
- Give sense of having stake in the system
- When community sees their representative in high position, they feel it's their government

### Methodological Justification

**MANDAL Commission Methodology:**

- Identified 11 parameters
- Four regarding social backwardness
- Three regarding educational backwardness  
- Four regarding economic backwardness
- Created composite score to identify socially and educationally backward classes

**Not Arbitrary:**

- There was method behind the so-called madness
- Used constitutional language of "socially and educationally backward classes"
