# Caste Among Non-Hindu Communities and Untouchability in Modern India

## CASTE AMONG NON-HINDU COMMUNITIES IN INDIAN SOCIETY (28:41)

- The structural view of caste holds that caste is NOT uniquely Hindu according to the structural view of caste
- Caste type features are also present in other religious communities
- Two main reasons for caste among non-Hindus:
  1. **Historical fact of conversion** - most non-Hindus are there in India due to conversion
  2. **Cultural influence of the Hindu majority**

### CASTE AMONG MUSLIMS (31:24)

- **Target Group**: Indian Muslims or South Asian Muslims in a broader sense
- Several studies by scholars like IMTIAZ AHMAD, M.K.A. SIDDIQUI, GHAUS ANSARI have indicated the prevalence of caste amongst Muslims in Indian society

#### Two Broad Categories Among Indian Muslims

**1. ASHRAF (High Born)**

- Root word is "sharif" meaning noble or of noble birth
- Considered as high born, literally implying and meaning high born
- Includes castes like:
  - Mughals
  - Sayyad
  - Sheikh 
  - Pathan

**Characteristics of Ashraf:**

- Claim that they are the descendants of the original Muslim immigrants to India
- Those who entered India from the outside - we are their children according to Ashrafs
- Not converts, but descendants of original Muslim immigrants
- Maintain endogamy
- Avoid social interaction with the low born Muslim castes

**2. AJLAF (Low Born)**

- Converts from the low service castes from Hindu society to Islam
- Those who have converted from the service casts, the low casts which were service casts in Hindu society
- Many of these casts retain their earlier nomenclature also - their earlier name also caste appellation or name

**Examples of Ajlaf Castes:**

- Teli
- Dhobi
- Nai (also called Hajam)
- Darzi
- Rangrez (those used to dye - tie and dye wala dye)
- Momin
- Julaha
- Fakir

**Additional Characteristics:**

- Have caste panchayat like their Hindu counterparts
- Many have retained their earlier nomenclature

**3. ARZAL (Third Category)**

- Converts from untouchable Hindu casts to Islam
- Difference between Ajlaf and Arzal: Ajlaf were low caste but they were not untouchable - they were the service casts, broadly Shudra varna type casts
- Arzal are converts from untouchable Hindu cast to Islam

**Examples include:**

- Chamar
- Mehtar

**Continuing Practices:**

- Even after conversion to Islam, many members of the cast continue to profess their earlier menial occupations
- Many of them continue to profess the earlier menial occupations like as sweepers, toilet cleaners etcetera

### CASTE AMONG CHRISTIANS (40:34)

- Studied by scholars like DUNCAN FORRESTER and DAVID MOSSE
- Found in various regions, particularly in Goa society

#### Caste Patterns in Goan Christian Society

- **Brahmins** (those who converted) became **Bamons** in Indian Christianity
- **Kshatriyas** became **Chardos**
- **Shudras** became **Sudirs**

#### Geographic and Denominational Variations

- **Catholics**: More prevalent in rural areas - caste behavior is found more prevalent among Catholic Christians residing in rural areas
- **Protestants**: Residing in city centers - among Protestants residing in urban centers it is weaker
- Caste practice and consciousness is weaker among Protestants in urban areas

### CASTE AMONG SIKHS (44:21)

- Studied by scholars like I.P. SINGH and SURINDER SINGH JODHKA
- **Particularly interesting case**: Sikhism arose at least in part protesting against the hierarchical nature of cast Hindu society
- Despite the fact that Sikhism arose protesting against the caste hierarchy, we find the practice of caste in the Sikh community

#### Caste Divisions Among Sikhs in Punjab

**1. Agriculturists**

- **Jat Sikhs**: Different from Jaats of UP Haryana - these are Jats of Punjab (as in "main Jat yamla pagla deewana hun")

**2. Trading Castes**

- Khatris
- Bhatias  
- Arora (quite common surnames in Delhi, North India, and Karol Bagh - you will find many property dealers)

**3. Artisan Castes (Ramgarhia)**

- Lohar
- Tarkhan
- Saini

**4. Others**

- Churha
- Valmiki

## CASTE OUTSIDE INDIA (48:51)

- According to this perspective, caste is a **global phenomena**
- Not a uniquely Hindu and not even a uniquely Indian phenomena
- Present in various parts of the world

### GLOBAL EXAMPLES OF CASTE-LIKE SYSTEMS

**Scholar BERREMAN** - major proponent of the idea that caste exists outside India as well

**Key Features Found Globally:**

- Birth based endogamous units
- Practices like untouchability
- Oppressed social groups denied basic civil rights exist in various other societies as well

#### International Examples

- **BURAKU in Japan**: An under class in Japanese society
- **BAEKJEONG in Korea**: An untouchable community in Korean society  
- **MIDGAN in Somalia**

### EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION (2013)

- European Parliament passed a resolution in 2013 highlighting the problem of caste based discrimination
- Highlighted caste based discrimination as a global evil, as a global problem
- According to this resolution, caste based discrimination exists in various countries ranging from:
  - India, Pakistan, Nepal
  - Yemen, Senegal
  - Mauritania, Somalia

### INDIAN DIASPORA AND CASTE

**Key Point**: Wherever you see Indian diaspora you will find prevalence of caste

**Theoretical Contradiction:**

- Rules of caste state that crossing the seven seas leads to loss of caste
- This was also one of the factors Gandhi had to factor in when traveling to various parts of the world
- Yet Indians have enthusiastically traveled to different parts of the world
- AMBEDKAR has written about it that wherever Indians go they carry their caste

**Study by S.S. KALSI:**

- Study of Sikh diaspora in England found the prevalence of caste

### RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE US

**Growing Acknowledgment:**

- Recent years have seen growing acknowledgment of the problem of caste discrimination outside of India, particularly among Indian diaspora in America

**Institutional Responses:**

- **Harvard University** and **University of California** added protection against caste discrimination in their policies
- **Cisco Case**: A law suit was filed against Cisco CEO by a Dalit engineer alleging that he had faced caste based discrimination

**EQUITY LABS Organization:**

- US based organization
- Have received reports of caste based discrimination from more than 250 techies working in the Silicon Valley
- Reports from people working in big corporates like Alphabet (Google's parent company), Facebook, etc.

**State Recognition:**

- American states of **Michigan** and **Colorado** have declared **14th of April as AMBEDKAR EQUITY DAY**

## DIFFERENCES IN CASTE OPERATION (62:38)

- Caste does exist among both Hindus and non-Hindus
- It operates in vastly different ways according to AMBEDKAR

### KEY DIFFERENCES

**1. Social Significance**

- The social significance of caste among Hindus is much higher, much higher than among non-Hindus
- For Hindus it is far more than non-Hindus

**Example by AMBEDKAR:**

- If you ask a Muslim "who are you?" he will say "I am a Muslim" and be content with that
- If you ask a Sikh "who are you?" he will say "I am a Sikh" and be content with that  
- But if you ask a Hindu "who are you?" he will not reply "I am a Hindu" - he will mention his caste
- Hindus always think in terms of their caste, unlike non-Hindus who also practice caste

**2. Religious vs Cultural Practice**

- **Among non-Hindus**: Caste is merely a cultural practice
- **For Hindus**: To practice caste is his religious duty

**3. Attitude Toward Infractions**

- **Breaking caste rules among Hindus**: Results in ex-communication - they outcast you (जाति बिरादरी से बेदखल कर देते हैं)
- **Among non-Hindus**: There is no outcasting for a Muslim and a Sikh
- The attitude towards infraction and breaking of caste rules is also different

## UNTOUCHABILITY (67:39)

- Regarded as the most deplorable aspect of the caste system
- The practice of untouchability

### DEFINITION AND SCOPE

**What is Untouchability?**

- The physical touch of certain persons born in certain cast is regarded as defiling and a source of ritual pollution and therefore it is avoided
- In Hindi it is called छुआछूत - literally means those who are not to be touched

**Scale of the Problem:**

- As per 2011 Census: **16.6% of India's population** belongs to Scheduled Castes
- Modern nomenclature used for those casts which were earlier regarded as untouchables
- In number terms we are talking about **more than 20 crore people** who are afflicted with and affected by the problem of untouchability

**Number of Castes:**

- As per annual report of Ministry of Social Justice 2020: **1263 castes** are considered as Scheduled Castes

### VARIOUS APPELLATIONS FOR UNTOUCHABLES

#### Traditional Terms

- **अछूत (Achhut)**: Literally means those who are not to be touched
- **अस्पर्श (Asparsh)**: Touch means स्पर्श, अस्पर्श means those who are not to be touched  
- **अवर्ण (Avarna)**: Meaning without a varna - those without a varna because they do not belong to the fourfold varna system
- **अति शूद्र (Ati Shudra)**: Worse than Shudra
- **पंचम (Pancham)**: Meaning the fifth category - the other four categories being the four varna
- **आदि द्रविड़ (Adi Draviḍa)**: आदि means first and primal - those at the beginning. Theory that Dravidians were the original inhabitants, Aryans came from outside and subordinated them
- **अंत्यज (Antyaj)**: अंत meaning those who reside at the end of the village. अज refers to a residential colony in a village

#### Modern Nomenclatures

- **Depressed Classes**: Official nomenclature during colonial times used by British Indian government
- **Harijan**: Popularized by GANDHI (literally meaning children of God or people of God) - term was initially used by Gujarati saint NARSINGH MEHTA but popularized by Gandhi
- **Dalit**: The preferred term of self-reference nowadays, preferred by the community

### COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF UNTOUCHABILITY

- Untouchability is far more than merely the avoidance of physical touch
- It is a very comprehensive system of disabilities and disprivileges
- Untouchables are subjected to:
  - **Geographical seclusion** - kept away geographically from others
  - **Denial of ritual privileges** 
  - **Social exclusion**
  - **Economic exploitation**
  - **Political disenfranchisement**

**Definition:** Untouchability involves institutionalized exploitation, segregation, subordination and humiliation

### HISTORICAL SEVERITY OF UNTOUCHABILITY PRACTICES (87:35)

**Based on AMBEDKAR's writings from first half of 20th century:**

#### Three Types of Untouchables

**1. The Untouchables**

- Those whose touch only had to be avoided
- Only whose physical touch had to be avoided

**2. The Unapproachables** 

- They could cause pollution if even their shadow falls on a caste Hindu
- Even their mere shadow falling can cause pollution
- Example: **NAYADIS of MALABAR** - they are dog eaters, unapproachable from Malabar Kerala region

**3. The Unseeable**

- Their sight, mere sight is considered as a source of ritual pollution
- Example: **PURADHA VANA from MADRAS** (modern day Tamil Nadu)
- Had to follow a nocturnal routine - not permitted to venture out of their homes after the sun rose
- Could come out of their house only after dusk like hyenas and then must go back before dawn because their mere sight was considered a source of pollution

### HARSH CODE IMPOSED ON UNTOUCHABLES

**A very harsh code was imposed on the untouchables by the touchable caste Hindus. Various things were prohibited:**

#### Religious and Social Restrictions

- Prohibited from entering the temple and using the road leading to the temple
- Prohibited from drawing water from the village well
- Prohibited from reading and hearing scriptures

#### Personal Restrictions

- **Untouchable caste men** were prohibited from sporting a mustache (mustache is an indicator of a high status)
- **Women** were prohibited from covering their breasts
- Their residences had to be outside the village
- Prohibited from accumulating wealth in any form
- Prohibited from wearing footwear and wearing clean cloths

- Compelled to perform menial occupations such as:
  - Manual scavenging
  - Garbage pickup
  - Cleaning sewerage, cleaning sewers and toilets
  - Carrying dead bodies of animals and humans

#### Social and Cultural Restrictions

- **Untouchable caste men** were prohibited from riding a horse during the marriage procession
- **Women** were prohibited from riding a palanqui (in English they call it a palanquin)
- Prohibited from singing in the presence of a touchable without permission
- Prohibited from wearing ornaments
- Prohibited from doing anything so as to pass off as a touchable caste Hindu
- Prohibited from giving high caste sounding names to their children

#### Community Participation

- When the whole village community would celebrate festivals would they join in? They were kept away from community celebrations but later who would clean up? They were compelled to do that
- They were considered as carriers of bad news - sent to deliver news of death
- Kept away from the political administrative system, education system

### MODERN PREVALENCE OF UNTOUCHABILITY (99:04)

**Current Status:** Whether we still have this rather pernicious practice of untouchability in Indian society since AMBEDKAR's times

#### Contemporary Evidence from Students

**Examples shared during lecture:**

- **Dausa District, Rajasthan**: Cordial family relations since long between communities, but they won't dine together
- **Patna, Bihar (Rural)**: Land laborers not permitted to touch the utensils used or enter his house
- **Bihar**: Different communities invited to community feasts at different points of time, Scheduled casts are called at the end and decidedly kept separate
- **Bengal**: Sweeper did not enter house, said first remove the floor mat and then I will enter
- **UP Village**: Residential segregation - untouchables still reside outside of the village
- **Various regions**: Money not handed over directly to persons belonging to untouchable caste - given from distance

#### Systematic Studies on Modern Untouchability

**1. "Untouchability in Rural India" Study (2001-2002)**

- **Authors**: GHANSHYAM SHAH and others
- **Scope**: 565 villages spread across 11 states

**Key Findings:**

- **73%** of villages: Dalits cannot enter non-Dalit homes
- **70%** of villages: Dalits cannot eat with non-Dalits  
- **64%** of villages: Dalits cannot enter the common temples
- **53%** of villages: Dalit women were ill treated by non-Dalit women
- **47%** of villages: Dalits were not allowed to take out marriage processions on public roads
- **46%** of villages: Dalits were not allowed to sell to milk cooperatives
- **32%** of villages: They were denied access to irrigation

**2. NAVSARJAN TRUST Study (Gujarat)**

- Conducted in more than 1500 villages in Gujarat
- Found systematic underestimation of the practice of untouchability in modern India
- Also noted presence of **horizontal untouchability** - higher Dalit caste practicing untouchability against lower Dalit castes

**3. Urban Studies**

- **TRINA VITHAYATHIL and GAYATRI SINGH** study of urban residential patterns
- Found that in seven big metros, the residences and the colonies of the Scheduled castes were segregated from those of the touchable casts
- **OM LYNCH study**: Found that Jatavs (Scheduled caste community in Agra city) - their residences were segregated

**4. National Survey Data**

**India Human Development Survey (Second):**

- **Data analyzed by**: AMIT THORAT and OMKAR JOSHI
- **27% of all households** admitted to practicing untouchability
- **30% of rural households** and **20% of urban households**

**Community-wise breakdown:**

- **52% of Brahmin** respondents
- **33% of OBC** respondents  
- **15% of Scheduled Castes** admitted to practicing untouchability

**Religious community-wise:**

- **35% of all Jain** respondents practice untouchability
- **30% Hindu**

**PEW Research Survey (2021):**

- **22% Indians in urban areas** and **31% in rural areas** are not willing to accept Scheduled caste neighbor

### EDUCATION SYSTEM DISCRIMINATION

- Reference to **SUKHADEO THORAT Committee** and his extensive writings on discrimination that Dalits, Scheduled casts and Scheduled tribes have faced in the education system

### DEVELOPMENTAL DISPARITIES

**Literacy Rate (2011 Census):**

- **Scheduled Castes**: 66%
- **Total Population**: 74%

**Other Indicators:**

- Higher incidence of poverty among Scheduled casts
- Higher landlessness 
- Lower asset ownership (basic things like scooter, mobile phone, toilet, water connection)
- Significant gaps between Scheduled casts and other casts in terms of asset ownership, income levels, incidence of poverty, unemployment, landlessness

### MODERN CASTE-BASED VIOLENCE

**SURAJ YENGDE** commenting on recent **HATHRAS rape incident**:

- Dalit girl was raped by members of another caste and killed
- Body was unceremoniously disposed of by local police
- Women of the higher caste supported the accused boys instead of the victim
- Eventually they were acquitted due to lack of evidence

**Modernization Paradox:**

- KOTHARI says that with modernization, Dalits have been empowered
- But with their empowerment, there is also an increase in atrocities against Dalits, increase crimes against Dalits
- Because they are not conforming to their traditional role ascribed to them in the caste system

## FACTORS AFFECTING UNTOUCHABILITY PRACTICES (120:18)

**Various factors have contributed to changes in this practice and its intensity and prevalence:**

### Constitutional and Legal Framework

- **Constitution**: Specific provisions like Article 17 expressly prohibiting untouchability
- **Article 25**: Throws open temples to all castes (state funded)
- **National Commission for Scheduled Castes**: Earlier it was combined with Scheduled Tribes, now bifurcated
- **Laws against atrocities**: SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act

### Social and Economic Changes

- **Political mobilization of Dalits**: Dalits have been sufficiently politically made aware and assertive as a community
- **Reservation policy**: Has ensured that a good number of Scheduled caste persons are part of the political administrative system  
- **Modern education**
- **Urbanization**: Untouchability practice is practically not feasible in an urban space
- **Market mechanisms**: Replacing Jajmani system - some Dalit communities became prosperous as a result

All of these have affected the practice of untouchability, nevertheless the practice does continue.

## THE DALIT MOVEMENT (140:45)

**Question**: Should we let this practice prevail in our society or should we uproot it and throw it out root and branch completely?

### ORIGINS OF MODERN DALIT MOVEMENT (145:52)

- The modern Dalit movement and the organized protest against the practice of untouchability and the caste system began during the **colonial period**

**Why during colonial period?**

- The colonial period provided a conducive atmosphere
- **Modern education**: Foundation was laid down which was open to all castes including untouchable castes
- Many members of the community accessed modern education and were then able to provide the leadership
- Most clear example is AMBEDKAR himself

**Other Conducive Factors:**

- **Christian missionaries** had developed a scalding critique - they tried to find holes and undesirable aspects of Hindu society and culture, highlighting the problem of untouchability
- **Jajmani system** began declining and being replaced by market mechanism, market based exchange
- Some Dalit communities became prosperous as a result of this

### IMPORTANT FIGURES AND CONTRIBUTIONS

**JYOTIRAO PHULE**: Also important, acknowledged by AMBEDKAR as his ideological mentor or guru, predecessor in a way

**AMBEDKAR**: 

- Defines modern India's Dalit movement
- His ideology, his writings, his efforts
- Started the **Depressed Classes Mission** with help of ruler of Kolhapur
- KOLHAPUR was known as the city of hostel for Scheduled caste students
- Many scholarships were provided by the state/ruler
- Criticizes Brahmanical scriptures - **Manusmriti** and organized burning of Manusmriti
- Organized lots of movements for entering into the temple
- Started protesting and demanding for more life but by the end of life he sort of gave up hope of Hinduism and towards the end of his life he converted to Buddhism

**Other Movements:**

- **Justice Party Movement**: Started in South India, was clearly an anti-Brahmanical movement, became more aggressive under PERIYAR, but was not too much concerned with the untouchable casts
- **Bahujan Samaj Party**: Established during 1980s first half by MANYAVAR KANSHIRAM - very momentous occasion in India's Dalit movement and its political dimension  
- **Dalit Panthers Party**: Inspired from Black Panthers Party in the US, established in India but did not have too much of an impact, limited time-wise and region-wise also
- **Bhim Army**: More recent development but an important one, represents aggressive kind of more militant Dalit activism

### HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE BY ANAND TEL TAMBADE

**ANAND TEL TAMBADE** (Dalit intellectual and historian) says:

- Dalit protest and agitations, numerous protests would have taken place even in pre-colonial India
- It is highly unlikely the Dalits took all this lying down for several centuries before colonial rule
- But why don't we find mention of Dalit protest agitations in the literature?
- Because the transmission of knowledge was controlled by Brahmins
- They must have white washed and omitted mention of any Dalit protest and uprisings in pre-colonial India
- It is unlikely that Dalits would have not risen against caste atrocities for thousands of years
- There must have been several protests before colonial rule also which have been omitted from Brahmin authored literature

### EVIDENCE IN BHAKTI MOVEMENT

- You do find instances of Dalits expressing discontent against the caste system in the **Bhakti Movement**
- **Bhakti saints**, several of whom came from untouchable cast, lower cast
- Participation of lower cast saints in the Bhakti movement also indicates an expression of discontent against the caste system in pre-colonial India

## GANDHI'S APPROACH TO UNTOUCHABILITY (153:51)

**During colonial period, there were two important strands of the Dalit movement:**

1. **GANDHI's efforts**
2. **AMBEDKAR's approach**

### GANDHI'S PERSPECTIVE AND METHODS

**Gandhi's View of the Problem:**

- For GANDHI, untouchability was like **cancerous growth in Hindu society**
- Just like you get rid of cancerous growth so that it doesn't further worsen the condition of the patient, likewise if Hinduism is to be saved, then untouchability has to be eliminated

**Historical Responsibility:**

- Untouchability is a **historic sin committed by the high caste Hindus against their fellow Hindu brothers**
- Since they are the ones who have committed this historic sin, they are the ones who also must shoulder the responsibility and therefore take the lead to remove the scourge from Hindu society
- The initiative for the removal of untouchability must be taken by the higher castes

**Practical Steps Taken by Gandhi:**

- Took steps to organize the higher casts in the drive against untouchability
- Established **HARIJAN SEVAK SANGH** to mobilize high caste Hindu for the removal of untouchability
- The Harijan Sevak Sangh would mobilize funds, conduct visits to Dalit bastis, carry out campaigns
- Started a newspaper titled **HARIJAN** and wrote profusely on the issue of untouchability to raise public awareness and education on the issue

**Gandhi's Solution - Hriday Parivartan:**

- For GANDHI, to remove untouchability the higher casts will have to undergo **हृदय परिवर्तन (Hriday Parivartan)** - meaning a change of heart
- It was in this context of a change of heart that GANDHI popularized the term **HARIJAN** to refer to the untouchables
- This term was initially used by Gujarati saint NARSINGH MEHTA but popularized by Gandhi
- **Literal meaning**: हरि के जन - Hari meaning Lord Vishnu and God, jan meaning the people and children of - literally the children of God and people of God

**Purpose of Term 'Harijan':**

- This term was targeted and meant to ensure hriday parivartan and a change of heart among the upper casts
- Those people till now you regarded as unworthy of human touch and ritually defiling, now your psychological makeup will transform
- You will start viewing them as children of God

**Gandhi's Religious Perspective:**

- For GANDHI, the practice of untouchability is **not sanctioned by the religion of Hinduism**
- Untouchability is not sanctioned by Hindu religion or Hindu scriptures
- It is a social practice, it was a later growth in the Hindu body politics
- Hindu scriptures do not sanction untouchability
- There is difference between society and religion - Hindu society has untouchability, religion of Hinduism does not

**Gandhi's Commitment:**

- GANDHI declared that **even if Swaraj has to be delayed by 100 years for the cause of removal of untouchability, it is worth it**
- The practice of untouchability also weakens our case against freedom from the British
- If we continue denying a significant section of our own population basic freedoms, then we lose the moral right to claim it from the British

**Leading by Personal Example:**

- GANDHI led by personal example - he practiced what he preached
- He himself visited Dalit homes, himself cleaned toilets
- He said untouchability has made Indians, untouchables in the whole world
- Simply it is denting our standing in the committee of nations
