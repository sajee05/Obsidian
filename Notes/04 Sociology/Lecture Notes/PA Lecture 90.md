# Demographic Issues in India: Age Structure, Demographic Dividend, and Population Policies

## AGE STRUCTURE AND DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND (31:17)

### Understanding Age Structure

- **Age Structure**: Refers to the relative share of different age groups in the population
- The age structure for various years shows three main age brackets:
  - **Children (0-14 years)**
  - **Youth/Working Age (15-59 years)** 
  - **Elderly (60 years and above)**

| Year | 0-14 years | 15-59 years | 60+ years |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 2011 | 29%        | 63%         | 8%        |
| 2026 | 23%        | 64%         | 12%       |

### Key Observations About India's Age Structure

- We are overwhelmingly a young population
- The bulk of the population is in the working age group (about 63-64%)
- Approximately 1/4 is children, half of that is elderly, and 2/3 of the population is working age population

## DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND (35:14)

### Definition and Concept

- **Demographic Dividend**: Refers to the economic growth potential that a country enjoys because of having a large working age population and low dependency ratio

- **Low Dependency Ratio**: Ratio of the dependent population to the working age population

- Our dependency ratio is low - more people are in the working age bracket

### India's Youth Profile

- **Median Age in India**: 28.2 years (as per UNFPA report 2022-23)
- **UNFPA**: United Nations Population Fund (earlier known as UN Fund for Population Activities)

#### Global Comparison of Median Ages:

| Country/Region | Median Age |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| India          | 28.2 years |
| Japan          | 49.1 years |
| Europe         | 42.2 years |
| North America  | 38.4 years |
| China          | 39 years   |

### Economic Benefits of Demographic Dividend

- **Greater Labor Supply**: More people in productive activity
- **Increased Domestic Consumption**: Young people with purchasing power drive market demand
- **Increased Savings**: Large young population contributes to overall savings

### Critical Understanding: Potential vs. Reality

- **Demographic dividend is only a potential advantage which needs to be harnessed through policy measures**
- Having a young population does not automatically result in economic growth
- It can potentially do so, but it has to be harnessed

#### Policy Requirements for Harnessing Demographic Dividend:

1. **Employment Generation**: Generate enough employment for the large young population
2. **Skill Enhancement**: Programs like Skill India are needed
3. **Education System Strengthening**: Improve reach and quality
4. **Per Capita Productivity**: Ensure it doesn't remain low

### Time-Limited Opportunity

- **Duration**: India will enjoy demographic dividend for a period of 37 years
- **Timeline**: Began in 2018 and will last till 2055
- This is the demographic window of opportunity that is available
- We need to design policies and reap this demographic dividend till it lasts

### Future Challenges: Demographic Tax and Burden

- The demographic dividend will be followed by what we can term as a demographic tax or demographic burden
- When these young people age en masse, they will be dependent
- The age structure will then change - you will have a very large dependent population
- We need to harness the dividend to the extent that we can provision for the future

### Potential Risks of Demographic Dividend

- **Risk if unable to generate adequate employment opportunities**: What will the young population do?
- **Crime rates will increase**: It will lead to social conflicts
- **Anti-immigrant sentiment**: Due to lack of adequate job opportunities
- **Large scale migration**: Social conflicts can be seen
- **It can be a demographic time bomb if not dealt with properly**

### Regional Variations in Demographic Dividend

- India's age structure is regionally diverse - it's not the same everywhere
- **Policies will have to be tailored to the age structure of the region**
- You can't have a pan-India policy only to reap the demographic dividend

#### Regional Differences:

**States where demographic window is closing (next 3-5 years):**

- Tamil Nadu
- Kerala  
- Andhra Pradesh
- Delhi

**States where demographic window is yet to open:**

- Uttar Pradesh
- Bihar
- Madhya Pradesh

#### Policy Implications by Region:

**For states where window is yet to open (like UP, Bihar, MP):**

- Promote the small family norm
- Focus on increasing contraceptive use
- Start vocational training from a young age

**For states where window is about to close (like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh):**

- Care for the elderly
- Have migrant-friendly policies
- Create conducive, welcoming policy framework for migrant workers because your economy needs them

## THE ELDERLY POPULATION (55:35)

### Current Status and Trends

- We are also a rapidly aging population
- The elderly has been historically one of the most neglected segments of the population in policy making since independence

#### Growth of Elderly Population:

| Year | Percentage of Elderly (60+) |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| 1971 | 5%                          |
| 1981 | 6%                          |
| 1991 | 7%                          |
| 2011 | 8%                          |
| 2026 | 12% (expected)              |

- **Between 2000-2050**: India's population is expected to increase by 55%
- **Population of 60+ during same time**: Will increase by 326%
- **Population of 80+**: Will increase by 700%, making it the fastest growing age bracket

### Historical Reasons for Neglect of Elderly

#### 1. Youth-Centric Policy Focus

- India was largely regarded as a country of young people
- Youth have always received a lot of policy attention
- Youth are regarded as the future of the country
- Any expenditure on youth is considered an investment for a brighter, better future

#### 2. Small Demographics Initially

- The elderly comprised a small chunk of the population (5-6% of total population)
- The bulk of the population were young and below 14

#### 3. Indian Value System

- **In Indian value system, we value old age**
- Unlike the West which is a very youth-centric culture that celebrates youth
- **Old age in Indian culture is associated with wisdom, accumulated experience which is considered socially useful**

#### 4. Joint Family System Expectations

- The various needs of the elderly were expected to be taken care of by the joint family system
- **Family was considered as the key institution assigned the role of taking care of the elderly**
- The joint family system was expected to take care of various financial, emotional, psychological, medical needs of the elderly

#### 5. Position of Power and Authority

- **The elderly enjoyed positions of power and authority in Indian society**
- **Indian joint family system was patriarchal, headed by the patriarch (eldest male member of the family)**
- **Status in family was accorded on generation basis**
- **Caste panchayat comprised of elders of the caste**
- **Village panchayat comprised of elders of the village**

### Policy Response Timeline

- **First National Policy for Older Persons**: Outlined in 1999 (more than 50 years after independence)
- **New National Policy on Senior Citizens**: Formulated in 2011

### Changing Circumstances Necessitating Policy Response

#### 1. Disintegration of Joint Family System

- **The joint family which was expected to take care of various needs of elderly is under strain, nuclearizing**
- Even in rural areas, most households were single married couple households
- Family nuclearization is taking place

#### 2. Changing Value Systems

- **Indian value systems are being impacted by the West**
- **Increasing individualism and materialism in our society**

#### 3. Shift in Power Dynamics

- **Within the joint family, who exercises real decision making now? It is the working male members of the family**
- **Power has shifted away from the patriarch into the hands of working adult men within the family**
- Even in village panchayats, young blood has been infused

#### 4. Growing Share of Elderly Population

- **The share of elderly in country's population is steadily rising**

### Challenges Faced by Elderly

#### 1. Abuse and Neglect

- **Because of changing value systems, disintegration of joint family, rise of individualism and materialism, now elderly in Indian families and Indian society have to face abuse and neglect**

#### 2. Feminization of Elderly Population

- **Meaning: within the elderly population, the share and proportion of women is increasing**

##### Sex Ratio Changes:

| Year | Elderly Females per 1000 Elderly Males |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1971 | 938                                    |
| 2011 | 1033                                   |

#### 3. Specific Challenges for Elderly Women

- **Elderly women are doubly the victims of old age and patriarchy**
- **Elderly women have their own peculiar problems**
- **Elderly women are less likely to own property** (because property is passed on the male line)
- **Elderly women are expected to perform household chores unlike elderly men**
- **Widowhood is culturally looked down upon**

### Solutions and Policy Framework

#### Active Aging Concept

- **Active Aging**: Concept developed by World Health Organization in 1990

- **Definition according to WHO**: The process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance their quality of life as people age

- Aging does not necessarily have to be accompanied by disempowerment and dependency

- **The elderly as they age, society has to make it possible that the elderly can continue to enjoy autonomy and dignity**

#### Policy Recommendations

1. **Encouraging civil society organizations working for elderly welfare**
2. **Developing social security mechanisms** (like pension systems)
3. **Provisioning affordable housing**
4. **Strengthening healthcare infrastructure**

#### National Policy on Senior Citizens 2011 Features

- **Envisages creating an age-integrated society**
- **Institutional care to be a last resort** - primary responsibility should remain with the family
- **Encouraging organizations working for elderly welfare**
- **Recognizes the particularly vulnerable position of old women**

### Age-Integrated Society Concept

- **Currently we have become an age-segregated society**
- Young people spend most of their time with young people, children with children, and elderly alone
- **Policy suggests creating greater and more frequent regular interaction between people of different age groups within the family and outside**

#### Implementation Strategies:

- **Make public places more elderly-friendly** (ramps instead of stairs, smaller steps)
- **Create opportunities for the elderly** to maintain autonomy and dignity

## FERTILITY AND TOTAL FERTILITY RATE (104:01)

### Understanding Total Fertility Rate (TFR)

- **Total Fertility Rate (TFR)**: Refers to the total number of live babies an average woman will have if she lives through the reproductive age and bears age-specific fertility
- **Reproductive Age**: From 15 years to 49 years
- Broadly, it is the average number of children a typical woman bears in the society

### Replacement Level TFR

- **Replacement Level TFR**: The number of children an average woman reproduces so that the total population is replaced
- **Replacement Level TFR is 2.1** (slightly higher than 2 to account for mortality)
- If every woman gives birth to 2.1 children on average, then the population remains stable

### India's TFR Trends

#### Current Status

- **India's present TFR (as per NFHS 5)**: 2.0
- **NFHS 5**: Conducted during 2019-20 (National Family Health Survey)
- India has attained a fertility rate which is below the replacement level

#### Historical Decline in TFR

| NFHS Survey | Year    | TFR |
| ----------- | ------- | --- |
| NFHS 1      | 1992-93 | 3.4 |
| NFHS 2      | 1998-99 | 2.9 |
| NFHS 3      | 2005-06 | 2.7 |
| NFHS 4      | 2015-16 | 2.2 |
| NFHS 5      | 2019-20 | 2.0 |

### Regional Variations in TFR

#### States with TFR above 2.1 (5 states):

1. **Bihar**: 2.98 (highest)
2. **Meghalaya**: 2.91
3. **Uttar Pradesh**: 2.3
4. **Jharkhand**: 2.2
5. **Manipur**: 2.17

#### Rural vs Urban Divide:

| Area        | TFR |
| ----------- | --- |
| Rural India | 2.1 |
| Urban India | 1.6 |

### Factors Behind Declining TFR

1. **Reduction in IMR (Infant Mortality Rate)**: Has direct correlation with TFR reduction - as infant mortality declines, total fertility also declines
2. **Women's Education**: Educated women have fewer children
3. **Increase in age of marriage**
4. **Government awareness programs**: Championing the small family norm, encouraging contraceptive usage
5. **Increasing material aspirations**: People want better life, children are expensive, so people think fewer children for better life

### Contraceptive Usage Trends

- **Increase in contraceptive usage**: Using any family planning method has increased from 54% (NFHS 4) to 67% (NFHS 5)

### Religious Community Differences

#### TFR by Religious Community (NFHS 5):

| Community | TFR |
| --------- | --- |
| Muslims   | 2.3 |
| Hindus    | 1.9 |

#### Historical Trends:

| NFHS   | Muslim TFR | Hindu TFR |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- |
| NFHS 3 | 3.4        | 2.5       |
| NFHS 4 | 2.6        | 2.1       |
| NFHS 5 | 2.3        | 1.9       |

### Key Observations on Community Differences

- **Muslim fertility rate is declining at a fast pace**
- **The gap between Hindu and Muslim fertility rate is narrowing fast**
- The difference between Hindu and Muslim fertility is not that much - it's not that Muslims are having 16 children while Hindus are having 2

## POPULATION CONTROL BILL DEBATE (118:31)

### Background and Context

- **Context**: One of the members of parliament of the ruling BJP introduced a private member's bill for population control (RAKESH SINHA)
- Population control legislative measures have been on the agenda of right-wing political parties since long
- Various Chief Ministers have expressed a desire to introduce penal provisions and legislative measures to control population

### Right-Wing Concerns and Perceptions

- **Particular concern of right-wing**: Muslims reproduce at a very high rate, Muslims particularly breed like rabbits which needs to be curbed
- **Population Jihad**: Looming threat of Muslims outnumbering Hindus in medium to long run
- Some right-wing leaders say Hindus should also have four children to not lag behind

### Arguments Against Population Control Bill

#### 1. Data Analysis (ALKA BASU's Perspective)

- **ALKA BASU claims**: Any discussion on fertility and demographics is often couched in "us versus them" terms
- **Discussions are framed**: One segment of population blames another segment for population explosion
- Hindus blame Muslims, educated blame uneducated, city dwellers blame rural people, middle class blame poor

#### 2. Factual Accuracy of Accusations

- **Poor do have higher fertility rate** than middle class and rich
- **Rural areas have higher fertility rate** than urban areas  
- **Uneducated have higher fertility** than educated
- **Muslims have higher fertility** than Hindus
- These are facts as per NFHS 5, but the differences are not extreme

#### 3. True Motivations (BASU's Argument)

- **Such laws are not really for population control but to target Muslims**
- **Such laws are an expression of divisiveness and bigotry**
- **Not born by any concern to control population growth, instead such legislative measures are to attack a particular community**

#### 4. SY QURAISHI's Analysis

- **SY QURAISHI**: Former Chief Election Commissioner who wrote a book on population issues
- **His argument**: The notion that Muslims breed like rabbits and Islam encourages having more children is **a myth propagated by Hindutva ideology**
- **Islam does not promote large families**
- **Islam is the only religion which promotes contraception** (natural contraception)

#### 5. Debunking Polygamy Myths

- **Myth**: Muslims are polygamous (one husband, four wives, 16 children)
- **QURAISHI's claim**: Yes, Islam permits polygamy, but **in India, Hindus are more polygamous than Muslims**
- **Polygamy is more prevalent among Hindus than Muslims** (though it's illegal for Hindus, it still happens)

#### 6. Socioeconomic Factors vs Religious Factors

- **Higher fertility among Muslims is not due to religion of Islam but due to socioeconomic conditions**
- **Muslims are socially and economically worse off**
- **Proof**: SACHAR COMMITTEE report highlighted Muslim socioeconomic backwardness

### Democratic and Human Rights Concerns

#### 1. Anti-Democratic Nature

- **Such measures are anti-democratic because they will be discriminatory**
- **They will target or penalize religious communities, poor, and uneducated**
- **How can the state penalize someone for being poor, uneducated, or having more children due to circumstances?**

#### 2. Examples of Discriminatory Implementation

- In some states, people can't stand in panchayat elections if they have more than a certain number of children
- In government jobs, people are penalized in some fashion

#### 3. Comparison with China

- **China had penal provisions for strict one-child policy, but China unlike India is not a democracy**
- **In implementation of one-child policy, Chinese state violated human rights of its people**
- **Due to labor shortage, China has now reversed its one-child policy**

### Current Relevance of Population Control Bill

- **Population control bill is now a dead question** given that fertility rate has already attained below replacement level
- **If we should have had any population control bill, it should have been back in times when we had much higher fertility rate**
- **Not today when we have already as a country reached TFR of 2.0**

## POPULATION POLICY IN INDIA (144:00)

### Evolution of Population Policy

- **India has had a population policy since independence**
- **Our population policy has evolved with time**
- **India was among the first countries in the world to put in place a national population policy and program**

### Phase 1: Nehru Period (1950 - Mid 1960s)

#### Clinic-Based Approach

- **Adopted a clinic-based approach**
- **State attempted to open large number of family planning clinics throughout the length and breadth of the country**
- **Purpose**: These family planning clinics would educate the masses about:
  - Need for family planning
  - Various options for family planning  
  - Various benefits of having a small family
  - Modern contraceptive techniques

#### Failure of Phase 1

- **This approach was very naive**
- **People did not turn up to the clinics**
- **The whole infrastructure that was built remained grossly under-utilized**
- **People were simply unaware and uninterested in family planning**
- **The approach bombed**

### Phase 2: Indira-Rajiv Phase (Mid 1960s - 1990)

#### Target-Based Approach

- **Adopted a target-based approach**
- **Targets were set for various demographic parameters at national level and then divided across states, from states to districts**

#### Examples of Targets:

- **Fertility rate targets**: National TFR target set, then UP should have this much, Kerala should have this much
- **IMR and MMR targets**: Infant and Maternal Mortality Rates respectively  
- **Contraceptive usage targets**
- **IUD insertion targets**: Intrauterine Device (like Copper T)

#### Implementation and Problems

- **Targets were to be met by bureaucracy**
- **Most targets remained unmet**
- **Large scale misreporting of data**
- **No mechanisms to verify claims of field workers**

#### Darkest Hour: Forced Sterilization Drive

- **Witnessed one of the darkest hours in history of India's family planning program**
- **Forced sterilization drive targeting males during Emergency**
- **Children as young as 12-14 years and elderly 70-80 years were forcibly sterilized**
- **Happened in Delhi, the national capital**

#### Aftermath

- **Family planning became a dirty word**
- **Officially, nomenclature was changed from Family Planning Program to Family Welfare**
- **People became scared of family planning workers**

### Phase 3: 1990s and Onwards

#### Increased Role of International Agencies

- **Increase in role of international donor agencies and international NGOs**
- **Due to globalization, international players got involved**

#### National Population Policy 2000

- **A National Population Policy was outlined in year 2000**
- **Very comprehensive policy document with numerous items on agenda**

##### Medium Term Objectives:

- **Reduce Total Fertility Rate to replacement level by 2010**

##### Long Term Objectives:

- **Achieve stable population by 2045** at level consistent with requirements of sustainable economic growth, social development, and environmental protection

##### Key Features:

- **Making school education free and compulsory till 14 years of age**
- **Reinforces vision to encourage voluntary and informed choices of citizens**
- **Voluntary nature of family planning has been underlined** - clear statement it will not be forced
- **Government's role is to make people aware** so people can make informed choices
- **Achieving reducing MMR to under 100 per lakh live births by 2010**
- **Encouraging delayed marriage for girls**
- **Achieving 80% institutional deliveries and 100% deliveries by trained personnel**
- **100% registration of all pregnancies, births, deaths, and marriages**
- **Containing spread of AIDS, sexually transmitted infections**
- **Integrating AYUSH in reproductive and child healthcare services**

### Analysis of Population Policy Effectiveness

#### Popular Perception: Massive Failure

- **Population policy is popularly regarded as massive failure**
- **Reason**: Population explosion that we have witnessed
- **India's population has gone from strength to strength, today we are most populous country**

#### VISARIYA's Counter-Argument: Unfair Assessment

##### Positive Aspects:

1. **India was among first countries to have population policy in place**

2. **Remarkable achievement considering:**
   
   - Geographic vastness
   - Demographic size  
   - Cultural heterogeneity
   - Having to take into account cultural sensitivities of different segments

3. **Targets remained unmet partly because they were set too high**
   
   - **Targets were unrealistic to begin with**
   - **Top-down approach problems**

4. **Population policy is not just about controlling growth of population - it is far more than that**

##### Success Indicators:

- **Significant reduction achieved in Infant Mortality Rate and Maternal Mortality Rate**
- **TFR has reduced from 3.4 (NFHS 1) to 2.0 (NFHS 5)**  
- **Birth rate has declined significantly**
- **Death rate has declined significantly**
- **Life expectancy has gone up significantly**
- **Threats like HIV have been effectively tackled**
- **Institutional deliveries have gone up**

#### Remaining Challenges

1. **Huge gap in contraceptive adoption**
   
   - **Huge unmet need for contraceptives**
   - **Only 56% of India's population uses any modern method of contraceptive/family planning**

2. **Unhealthy pattern of contraceptive usage:**

| Method               | Usage Percentage |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Female Sterilization | 37.9%            |
| Male Sterilization   | 0.3%             |
| Condom Usage         | 9.5%             |

- **Burden of family planning is falling excessively on women**
- **Male sterilization technique is far less invasive and less dangerous than female sterilization**
- **Many women were not made aware of possible side effects or complications of sterilization**

### Policy Success Factors (Recent Trends)

- **Recent success shows that voluntary nature of policy works better**
- **Leaving it up to people and raising awareness is more successful than coercive measures**
- **Informed choices are what work, and that has worked in Indian context**
- **Working towards improving sex education framework - it's a work in progress**
