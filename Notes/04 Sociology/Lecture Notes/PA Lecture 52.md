# TECHNIQUES OF DATA COLLECTION

## RECAP OF PREVIOUS TOPICS (00:52)

- **Hypothesis**: A statement that tells about the relationship between different variables. It is a statement that proposes a relationship between two or more variables which is yet to be accepted and rejected subject to empirical testing.

- **THOMAS KUHN's perspective**: The scientific truth is nearly an agreement of the present day scientific community and it changes with paradigm shift.

- **POPPER's principle**: Absolutely no number of positive outcomes can prove a theory to be true and deny any future adverse outcomes.

## SAMPLING METHODS REVIEW (21:38)

- **Probability Sampling**: When every element in the population has an equal chance or equal probability and hence the name probability sampling of being selected in the sample.

### Types of Probability Sampling Techniques:

- **Random Sampling**
- **Stratified Random Sampling** 
- **Cluster Sampling**: When a large population spread over a vast area, through random sampling we select some clusters then further subdivide into clusters and then select some randomly
- **Snowball Sampling**: A non-probability sampling technique used when the researcher does not have easy access to the elements of the population. The researcher begins with a few persons into the sample and then through reference increases the size of the sample by incorporating more and more persons into it.

| Sampling Type     | Probability/Non-Probability | Key Characteristics              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Random Sampling   | Probability                 | Equal chance for all elements    |
| Stratified Random | Probability                 | Population divided into strata   |
| Cluster Sampling  | Probability                 | Population divided into clusters |
| Snowball Sampling | Non-Probability             | Reference-based expansion        |

## QUESTIONNAIRE AS DATA COLLECTION METHOD (25:22)

### Precautions While Designing a Questionnaire:

1. **Language Simplicity**: Language of the question should be simple, keeping in mind the respondents. It should be in a language which the respondents can understand.

2. **Non-Leading Questions**: Questions should not be leading.

3. **Optimal Number**: Not too many questions and not too few.

4. **Exhaustive Answer Choices**: Answer choices in case of closed-ended questions should be exhaustive.

## INTERVIEW AS DATA COLLECTION METHOD (26:31)

- **Definition**: Interview is a one-on-one interaction between an interviewer and an interviewee.
- **Terminology**: 
  - **Interviewer**: The person who asks the questions
  - **Interviewee**: The person who answers the questions

### Types of Interview Conduct:

- **Traditional**: Face-to-face
- **Modern**: Can be conducted telephonically and virtually due to technological advancements

### Disadvantages of Interviews:

1. **Time Consuming**: Interviews are quite time consuming and require substantial manpower for conducting a large number of interviews.

2. **Costly Affair**: It will require greater coordination and infrastructure requirements like office space, interview rooms, refreshments.

3. **Privacy Concerns**: People may not be forthcoming during interviews particularly if it concerns those matters which are deemed private or personal.

4. **Social Interaction Bias**: The interview is a social interaction situation. The responses of the interviewee may get colored by the biases of the interviewer.

5. **Training Requirements**: Need for trained personnel adds to the cost of research.

### Example of Interviewer Bias:

- If conducting research on attitudes of UPSC aspirants towards caste-based reservation in civil services
- Interviewer's facial expressions showing disapproval may modify the interviewee's response
- People tend to seek each other's approval in social interaction situations

### Advantages of Interviews:

1. **Higher Response Rate**: Response rate is clearly higher compared to questionnaires.

2. **Clarification Opportunity**: The interviewee can seek clarification if any question is not clear.

3. **Follow-up Questions**: The interviewer can ask follow-up questions to dig deeper.

4. **Accessibility**: In the Indian context, this technique can be used to collect information from illiterate persons who cannot fill questionnaires but can answer in interviews.

### Types of Interviews:

| Interview Type | Structure                             | Characteristics                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structured     | Fixed predetermined list of questions | Same questions asked to every interviewee                  |
| Unstructured   | No fixed list                         | Questions based on responses, more customized and tailored |

- **Structured Interviews**: When there is a fixed predetermined list of questions which are asked to the interviewees. Census enumerators conduct structured interviews.

- **Unstructured Interviews**: There is no fixed predetermined list of questions. Depending on the responses of the interviewee, follow-up questions are asked. Most real-life interviews (like job interviews, civil services personality test) are partly structured and partly unstructured.

### Comparison: Which is Better?

- **Structured**: Information obtained is far more processable and amenable to processing. Better comparison of different people's responses.
- **Unstructured**: Offers deeper insight, more tailored to each interviewee, but information is difficult to process and compare.

## OBSERVATION AS DATA COLLECTION METHOD (43:44)

- **Definition**: Simply by observing intently, recording whatever you are observing, collecting information in this manner can also yield rich insights.

### Types of Observation:

#### Participant Observation:

- The researcher actively participates in the life of the group under investigation.

#### Non-Participant Observation:

- The researcher doesn't actively participate in the life of the group under observation.

### Example: Teacher-Student Interaction Research in UPSC Coaching Institute

**Non-Participant Observation**:

- Researcher observes from distance (like through webcam)
- Watches what teacher is saying, how students are responding
- Studies group dynamics without participating

**Participant Observation**:

- Researcher disguises as a student
- Takes admission and actively participates in class discussions
- Becomes friends with fellow students
- Interacts with teacher and other students

### Advantages and Disadvantages:

| Aspect            | Participant Observation                                                                                                 | Non-Participant Observation                                                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Advantages**    | Deeper insight into group dynamics; Better understanding of norms and customs; Members more forthcoming with real views | Observes reality somewhat uncontaminated and unchanged due to research involvement |
| **Disadvantages** | May alter social reality being studied; Researcher's active participation changes the situation                         | Limited to visible observations only; Cannot access deeper insights                |

### Classic Study: WILLIAM FOOT WHYTE's "Street Corner Society"

- **Quote from FOOT WHYTE**: "I began my research as a non-participant observer but after some time I almost ended up as a non-observing participant."
- **Issue**: Became so emotionally involved with gang members that he almost forgot his primary purpose as a researcher
- **Lesson**: Need to draw the line between involvement and maintaining research objectivity

### Challenges in Observation Method:

1. **Time Consuming**: Researchers typically take several months at a stretch, spending prolonged periods with particular groups.

2. **Small Group Limitation**: Useful only for small-sized groups, not for studying whole societies or countries.

3. **Practical Limitations**: In many areas of sociological interest, it may not be practically feasible to gather information through observation (e.g., criminal activities, domestic violence, suicide, sexual activity).

4. **Researcher Presence Effect**: Even in non-participant observation, the researcher's mere physical presence may affect group dynamics or alter the social situation.

5. **Access and Entry Issues**: Need to gain access and entry into the group. This becomes particularly challenging if there is a marked difference in socioeconomic backgrounds of the group under observation and the researcher.

6. **Ethical Dilemmas**: 
   
   - Should the researcher reveal their identity as a researcher?
   - Should consent be sought before collecting information?
   - If researcher comes across illegal activities, should they share it with authorities?
   - Should the researcher maintain privacy and confidentiality of group members?
   - To what extent should one participate?
   - How to withdraw and how to deal with emotional connections developed?

### Classic Unethical Study: LAUD HUMPHREYS' "Tea Room Trade"

- **Topic**: Anonymous sex in public places (homosexual activity in public toilets)
- **Method**: 
  - Participated as a voyeur (watching others engage in sexual activity)
  - Noted down license plate numbers
  - Followed participants to their homes
  - Interviewed them on false pretexts without revealing research purpose
- **Why Unethical**: Violated privacy, used deception, followed people without consent
- **Significance**: Classic example of how sociological research should not be conducted

### Maintaining Objectivity Challenge:

- Researchers face difficulty maintaining objectivity during long-term involvement
- Risk of becoming too emotionally attached to the group
- Need to balance involvement with research purpose

## ETHNOGRAPHY (82:01)

- **Definition**: When a researcher undertakes a very detailed, comprehensive study of a particular group of people, that is called ethnography.

- **Etymology**: 
  
  - **Ethnos**: People
  - **Graphy**: Study of
  - **Combined meaning**: A very detailed study of a people

### Historical Development:

- **Originally developed by**: European anthropologists who began studying primitive small-scale tribes in Africa
- **Later adoption**: Extensively used in Indian sociology and anthropology through village studies

### Indian Context - Village Studies:

- **Prominent researchers**: M.N. SRINIVAS, ANDRE BETEILLE
- **Method**: Researchers would go to particular villages, live among people for 6-10 months
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All dimensions of life including:
  - Inter-caste dynamics
  - Intra-family life
  - Festivals and celebrations
  - Land holding patterns
  - Housing patterns
  - Caste relationships
  - Geography of the place
  - Rural economy and crops
  - Village panchayat control
  - Age group relationships
  - Occupations and income levels
  - Disability status
  - Literacy rates
  - Education levels

### Example: MALINOWSKI's Study of TROBRIAND ISLANDERS

- Classic ethnographic study referenced in functionalism and religion topics

### Ethnographic Process:

- **Duration**: Several months of living with the community
- **Documentation**: Detailed diary notes maintained throughout
- **Scope**: Nearly all aspects of life in that village/community
- **Output**: Very rich, detailed account of all dimensions of their lives

### Researcher Integration Challenges:

- **Example**: VERRIER ELWIN (British researcher in India)
  - Advised NEHRU on tribal policy
  - Married a tribal woman despite language and cultural barriers
  - Had a child named JAVAHAR (after NEHRU)
  - Later divorced
  - Called it "the darkest period of my life"
- **Lesson**: Need for careful balance in researcher involvement

## FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION (93:25)

- **Definition**: A focus group discussion involves a number of people who discuss various dimensions of a specific issue. The participants of the group freely express their views and opinions in a relaxed and congenial atmosphere.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Group Size**: Manageable number (typically 5-18 people)
- **Not too few**: Need variety of viewpoints and stimulation
- **Not too large**: Avoid becoming unwieldy, unmanageable, or cacophonous
- **Specific Topic**: Discussion centered on predetermined subject
- **Atmosphere**: Relaxed and congenial (friendly, welcoming, tension-free)

### Corporate Usage:

- **Purpose**: Product launch decisions, feature development, customer feedback
- **Example**: MERCEDES BENZ launching new product
  - **Target Audience**: Rich people (not rickshaw pullers or lower division clerks)
  - **Diversity within target**: Rich men and women, different types of wealthy individuals
  - **Stakeholder inclusion**: Customers, consumers, and key influencers

### Stakeholder Analysis Example - Baby Food (BORNVITA):

- **Consumer**: The baby (who consumes the product)
- **Customer**: The mother (who purchases the product)  
- **Influencers**: Maternal grandmother, father, doctor
- **Research focus**: Understanding decision-making process and influence levels

### Utility According to Scholars:

**DAVID MORGAN suggests**: Focus groups are useful with groups of people who have a shared area of interest and expertise.

**FRANK TONKISS points out**: The internet has enabled virtual focus group discussions through online chat rooms.

### Advantages over Interviews:

**SUE WILKINSON suggests**: Focus group discussions are closer to real life than one-on-one interviews because:

- Natural conversation involves multiple people stimulating each other
- Less artificial than Q&A format of interviews
- People counter each other's points naturally
- More like how we actually communicate in groups

### Challenges and Limitations:

1. **Member Selection**: Challenge of selecting appropriate and right members

2. **Incentivization Effects**: 
   
   - Participants often incentivized to attend (free products, monetary compensation)
   - May not express genuine views due to incentives
   - Views expressed may not be real opinions and viewpoints

3. **Domination by Few Members**: 
   
   - Some members may dominate the discussion due to assertive personalities
   - Others may not get chance to express themselves
   - Quieter participants may remain silent

4. **Discussion Digression**: 
   
   - Tendency for discussion to digress from the issue at hand
   - **Moderator's Role**: Ensure discussion stays on track, all members get opportunity to express, bring discussion back when it digresses

5. **Moderator Bias**: 
   
   - Inadequately trained moderator may impose own views on discussion
   - Should work only as facilitator, not as participant
   - **Example**: TV debate anchors taking on role of participants instead of moderating

## SURVEY METHOD (131:44)

- **Definition**: Collection of data in a standardized format from a large number of people. It helps in gathering quantitative data typically.

### Relationship with Questionnaire:

- **Questionnaire**: Simply the list of questions
- **Survey**: Broader term - the method which involves not just collection of information but also its processing and analyzing
- **Method combination**: May use combination of questionnaires and structured interviews
- **Question type**: Closed-ended questions primarily

### Survey Characteristics:

- **Widely used**: Quantitative research tool
- **Standardized information**: Obtains information in standardized form from large number of people  
- **Comprehensive**: Provides an overview - comprehensive set of information on particular subject
- **Data gathering methods**: Through questionnaires and structured interviews

### Major Survey Examples:

- **Census**: Largest scale survey
- **National Family Health Survey**: Large scale survey
- **Economic Survey**: That students are close to
- **Forest Survey**: Conducted periodically
- **Linguistic Survey of India**: Conducted by language research institute
- **India Human Development Survey**: Conducted by University of Maryland, America
- **PEW Research**: Popular survey organization

### Advantages of Survey Method:

1. **Large Quantity Data Collection**: Surveys help to collect large quantity of information

2. **Thorough Understanding**: Help to develop thorough understanding of the issue and situation

3. **Scientific Objectivity**: Characterized by objectivity - high level of objectivity is there

4. **Policy Utility**: Quite useful for policy makers and administrators - serve as input in policy making

5. **Research Value**: Useful for researchers and scholars for research purposes

6. **Social Change Analysis**: Help us to understand and analyze patterns of social change
   
   - **Example**: National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Can compare fertility rates across different surveys
   - Understand how contraceptive usage patterns have changed
   - Analyze how people's reproductive behavior is changing

### Disadvantages and Challenges:

1. **Update Gap**: There will be a gap in updation of information

2. **Resource Intensive**: 
   
   - Requires fair amount of manpower
   - Fairly costly affair due to training costs
   - Training cost is an important component

3. **Time Consuming**: Since large population is to be covered, can be quite time consuming

4. **Non-cooperation**: 
   
   - Respondents may not cooperate
   - May not be willing to divulge information
   - **Example**: Researching condition of women in Haryana - people may not give truthful answers about number of daughters

5. **Present Time Orientation**: 
   
   - Surveys capture information at present
   - Have present time orientation
   - May not be useful tool for historical analysis (unless conducted over long time periods)

## CENSUS (144:53)

- **Hindi term**: Janagaṇanā (जनगणना) - literally means "counting people"
- **Limitation of Hindi term**: Somewhat of a misnomer as it doesn't capture full import of what census exercise does - it's not merely a head count of population

### Comprehensive Definition:

Census is the process of collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating demographic, social and economic data relating to all the persons in the country. Thus, the census is an official survey of the whole population of the country. It involves a procedure of systematically acquiring, recording and calculating information about all the members in a given population.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Coverage**: No sampling - covers the whole of the population
- **Frequency**: In India, conducted every 10 years (decennial census)
- **Comprehensive data**: Generates wealth of data, not merely head count

### Historical Timeline:

- **First modern census**: 1865-1872 (long drawn seven-year period)
- **Regular pattern**: Since 1881, every 10 years (1881, 1891, 1901, and so on)
- **Exception**: 2021 census delayed due to pandemic ⭐ (The lecturer mentions this was delayed due to pandemic and then suggests political reasons, which may be speculative commentary rather than factual information)

### Data Captured by Census:

- **Demographics**: Gender (sex ratio, child sex ratio), age composition, average life expectancy
- **Religion**: Religious composition of country
- **Fertility**: Fertility rates
- **Housing**: Type of house (kutcha/pucca), building materials
- **Utilities**: Running tap, toilet facilities, car/two-wheeler ownership, internet access
- **Socioeconomic**: Occupation, income level, education level, literacy rate
- **Special needs**: Disability status
- **Geographic**: Geographic information of places

### Importance and Uses:

1. **Comprehensive Data Source**: Very comprehensive source of data

2. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Helps in evidence-based decision making
   
   - Data useful for administration, planning and scientific resource allocation
   - Helps government evaluate various programs (e.g., Swachh Bharat toilet construction, Har Ghar Jal scheme, Ujjwala scheme for clean fuel)

3. **Multi-level Utility**: Census data available for policy implementation at different levels:
   
   - National level
   - State level  
   - District level

4. **Corporate Utility**: Also useful for corporates and private sector
   
   - **Example**: MERCEDES needs to know purchasing power distribution
   - Targeted marketing and advertising budget decisions
   - Market research for product placement

5. **Civil Society Organizations**: Useful for NGOs and civil society organizations

6. **Policy Formulation and Implementation**: Plays very important role in policy formulation and implementation

7. **Research Value**: Also very useful for researchers and scholars in various fields:
   
   - Economists studying consumption patterns
   - Sociologists studying family size changes
   - Various academic research purposes

8. **Electoral Constituencies**: Plays important role in demarcation of electoral constituencies

### Challenges in Conducting Census:

1. **High Cost**: Census is a very costly exercise - thousands of crores need to be allocated

2. **Manpower Issues**: 
   
   - Lack of trained professionals
   - Pressure on teachers (typically used for census enumeration and elections)
   - If census enumerators are untrained or ill-trained, it affects data quality

3. **Non-cooperation**: 
   
   - People may furnish false information
   - People may refuse to cooperate

4. **Social Desirability Bias**: 
   
   - People's responses may be colored due to social desirability bias
   - Respondents may wish to give responses considered socially desirable and respectable
   - People may lie to appear more pleasing in eyes of others

5. **Data Limitations**: 
   
   - Collects enormous amounts of quantitative data but lacks qualitative data
   - **Example**: Can tell how many Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians but not how practicing they are or depth of their faith

6. **Human Errors**: 
   
   - Mistakes may be made in recording of data
   - Enumerators dealing with multiple households per day
   - Mechanical human errors possible (writing 3 instead of 2)
   - When inundated with information and data, tend to make silly errors

7. **Enumerator Bias**: Bias of enumerators may contaminate the data

8. **Accessibility Issues**: 
   
   - Difficulty in collecting data for certain categories of persons:
   - Nomads, homeless people
   - Those living in very inaccessible areas

9. **Community Participation**: 
   
   - People may not enthusiastically participate in census exercise
   - Lack of community participation and involvement

### Special Mention - Caste Census:

- Last conducted in 1931
- Recently declared that results of caste census have been released in Bihar
- Ongoing debate about conducting nationwide caste census ⭐ (Lecturer asks for student opinions on whether nationwide caste census should be conducted, which indicates this is a matter of ongoing political debate rather than settled fact)
