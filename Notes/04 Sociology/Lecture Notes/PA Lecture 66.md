## WOMEN AND POLITICS (25:18)

### Positive Aspects of Women's Political Participation

#### Notable Women Leaders

- **INDIRA GANDHI**: One of the longest-serving women prime ministers, termed as "the only man in her cabinet"
- **State-level leaders**: JAYALALITHAA, MAMATA BANERJEE, MAYAWATI, MAMATA BANERJEE
- **Current scenario**: President of India is also a tribal woman

#### Constitutional and Legal Framework

- **73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts**: Mandatory reservation in local bodies (panchayats and urban local bodies)
- **Recent achievement**: NARI SHAKTI VANDAN ADHINIYAM passed

#### Electoral Participation

- **Women voters**: Turning out in good numbers, almost at par with men
- **Sometimes surpassing**: Male voter turnout in elections

### Areas of Concern

#### Sarpanch Pati Raj Culture

- **Definition**: Women reduced to mere figureheads while real authority wielded by male family members (husbands, sons)
- **Example from Bihar**: Village sarpanch is known by her husband - "real thai" (real authority)
- **Pattern**: When seat gets reserved, dominant political families put forth their women candidates

#### Statistical Representation

- **According to ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms) 2019**: Only 9% of all MPs and MLAs in the country are women
- **17th Lok Sabha**: 14% women members (highest since independence)
- **Inter-Parliamentary Union ranking**: India ranks 140 out of 196 countries in women's representation

#### Women's Reservation Bill Analysis

##### Background and Timeline

- **First introduced**: 1996
- **Passed after**: More than 25 years (2023)
- **Constitutional amendment**: 128th Amendment Bill
- **Official name**: NARI SHAKTI VANDAN ADHINIYAM

##### Provisions and Concerns

- **Reservation percentage**: 33% in Lok Sabha and state assemblies
- **Implementation delay**: Only after census and delimitation exercise

| Concern Category | Specific Issues                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implementation   | • Delayed due to census and delimitation                        |
| Effectiveness    | • Mere increase in numbers may not improve women's status       |
| Symbolic nature  | • May replicate panchayat-level male control                    |
| Representation   | • May only benefit upper-caste women without quota within quota |

##### Scholarly Views on the Bill

**NANDINI SUNDAR**: Women should not have to wait for census and delimitation

**YOGESH PALANKAR**: Bill is a tactic by ruling party to project itself as harbinger of NARI SHAKTI

**NIVEDITA MENON**: 

- Title is patronizing - projects women as idols to be worshipped instead of citizens with equal rights
- Current bill likely to benefit elite women who already have cultural and political capital

**Committee on Status of Women in India (2015)**: Recommended 50% reservation (current bill falls short)

##### Historical Context

- **Constituent Assembly debate**: Reservation for women was discussed but rejected by both constituent assembly and women's organizations
- **Reasoning then**: Underestimated women's strength to compete as equals
- **Mid-1990s**: Broad consensus emerged in favor of women's reservation

##### Current Concerns About the Bill

**KAVITA KRISHNAN**: Without quota within quota, OBC men may be displaced by upper-caste women because their constituencies may be specifically targeted for reservation

**PANKAJ GUPTA**: 

- Historic step but alone may not make streets safer for women
- **International examples**: 
  - South Africa: 40% women parliamentarians but high crime against women
  - Rwanda: 61% women parliamentarians but high crime against women
  - Netherlands, Sweden, Australia: Lower crimes against women due to good representation in both parliament AND police force

#### Patriarchal Attitudes in Politics

- **MULAYAM SINGH YADAV's comment**: "If this bill is passed, it will provoke young men to whistle in parliament"
- **Common argument**: Urban elite women cannot represent rural women

### Women as Voters

- **Patriarchal control**: Women voters greatly subjected to patriarchal controls and monitoring
- **Personal anecdote shared**: Father directing voting choice at electoral booth
- **Pattern**: Most decisions of who to vote are greatly influenced by male family members

## WOMEN AND ECONOMY (59:08)

### Labor Force Participation

#### Global Rankings and Statistics

- **Global Gender Gap Report**: India ranks 140 out of 156 countries on economic empowerment parameter
- **Labor force participation**: Huge gender gap - women's participation around 21% compared to 80% of men
- **International Labor Organization (ILO)**: Gender gap in wages about 30% in India

#### Counterintuitive Trends

##### Declining Female Labor Force Participation

- **Cultural mindset**: If woman is compelled to work outside home, seen as dishonorable for men of family
- **Pattern**: As family incomes improve, women are withdrawn from the workforce
- **Explanation**: Working outside home indicates inability of men to support family

##### Impact of Women's Education

- **Counterintuitive effect**: Increase in women's education leads to reduced labor force participation
- **Reason**: Women spending longer years in education system

### Unpaid Care Work

- **Economic value**: Estimated at about 3.1% of India's GDP
- **Consequence**: Results in time poverty - fewer hours available for productive labor
- **Activities**: Taking care of children, elderly, household management

### Feminization of Agriculture

#### Definition and Causes

- **Meaning**: Agricultural work responsibilities increasingly shouldered by women
- **Primary cause**: Agriculture becoming less remunerative, leading to male migration to cities for better-paying jobs

#### Problems Associated

1. **Dual burden**: Women continue traditional roles plus agricultural work
2. **Low land ownership**: Women's land ownership remains meager
3. **Lower income**: Income from agriculture is meager compared to male counterparts
4. **Unsuitable machinery**: Agricultural machinery (tractors, threshers) designed primarily for male workers
5. **Productivity issues**: Difficult for women to operate machinery, affecting productivity

### Workplace Issues

- **Sexual harassment**: ME TOO movement in India as expression
- **Glass ceiling**: Women workers excluded from male-dominated trade unions
- **Infrastructure gaps**: Lack of women's toilets, feeding rooms at workplace, construction sites
- **Union representation**: Male-dominated trade unions do not articulate interests of women workers

## WOMEN AND EDUCATION SYSTEM (74:01)

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Distance and Safety  | • Difficult attendance if school located at distance<br>• Safety concerns for girl child |
| Staff Representation | • Lack of female teachers<br>• Important for girl child's comfort and security           |

| Curriculum Issues    | • School curriculum perpetuates gender stereotypes                                       |

#### Importance of Female Teachers

- **Confiding comfort**: Girl child can confide to greater extent in female teachers
- **Biological considerations**: Age when menstruation begins with hormonal and bodily changes
- **Safety concerns**: Male teachers may subject girl children to sexual harassment
- **Parental confidence**: Presence of female teachers gives sense of security to parents

- **Reinforcement**: Such ways gender stereotypes are reinforced in education
- **Historical examples**: RANI LAKSHMIBAI celebrated for valor but referred to as "near masculine" because aggression and dominance considered male traits

## WOMEN AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS (80:35)

- **Unequal beneficiaries**: Women are not equal beneficiaries of the developmental exercise

### Evidence from Reports

- **High Level Committee on Status of Women in India (2015)**: Women have remained behind men on various developmental parameters
- **Parameters mentioned**: Literacy rate, sex ratio, child sex ratio, gross enrollment ratio in higher education

| Implementation Level | Specific Problems                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Police Force         | • Less than 11% women representation<br>• Patriarchal mindset in police force                                                                                |

#### Personal Laws

- **Hindu personal laws**: Sufficiently reformed by progressive legislation
- **Muslim personal laws**: Remained almost untouched until recently (until MUSLIM MAHILA HIFAZAT ACT)

### Barriers to Access Justice

#### Social and Cultural Impediments

- **Protection from family**: Pro-women legislation often offers protection from family members
- **Practical difficulty**: Very difficult for woman to go against husband and in-laws legally
- **Inheritance issues**: Daughters do not get parental inheritance despite laws to contrary

#### RATNA KAPUR and KALPA KANABIRAN's Analysis

- **Core argument**: Merely having pro-women laws is not sufficient to ensure gender justice
- **Required change**: Need change in people's mindsets
- **Example**: Dowry Prohibition Law - dowry continues to enjoy widespread legitimacy despite being unlawful

### Areas Remaining Unlegislated

- **Marital rape**: Not criminalized
- **Rights of domestic workers**: Not adequately addressed
- **Women's access**: Unable to access justice due to social and cultural barriers

## WOMEN AND MEDIA (103:11)

### Positive Role of Media

- **Specific issues**: They glorify eve teasing, sexual harassment, and stalking
- **Problem**: Hero portrayed in positive light while engaging in problematic behavior

#### URVASHI BUTALIA's Historical Analysis

- **Timeframe**: 1980s and 1990s (refashioning India period)
- **Key observation**: Women in media have gone from invisibility to hyper-visibility
- **Cause**: Media explosion during economic opening up
- **Critical insight**: Hyper-visibility does not necessarily lead to gender just society

### Stereotypical Portrayals in Cinema

Women typically portrayed in three categories:

1. **SITA Type**: 
   
   - Devoted wife dutifully following husband's footsteps
   - Helping him achieve his life goals
   - Weak, vulnerable, pure, loyal
   - Waiting to be rescued by hero

- Widow remarriage
- Child marriage and raising age of marriage
- Women's education
- Purdah system
- Plight of widows

##### Assessment

- **Limited success**: Led to progressive legislation due to pressure on colonial state
- **Limitation**: Social base was narrow - confined to upper caste, middle class, city-based women
- **Gap**: Could not rope in rural women or marginalized communities

#### Second Phase (1915-1950)

##### Socio-Political Context

- **Dominated by**: Anti-colonial struggle led by GANDHI
- **GANDHI's impact**: Two-fold effect on women according to MADHU KISHWAR

##### GANDHI's Two-fold Impact

**1. Politicization of Women**

- **Traditional role**: Women conventionally viewed as having role within confines of home
- **GANDHI's vision**: Envisaged public role for women in public affairs
- **Result**: Large number of women participated in anti-colonial struggle (picketing liquor shops, DANDI march)

**2. Feminization of Politics**

- **Traditional politics**: Associated with masculine virtues (dominance, aggression, control)
- **GANDHI's approach**: Associated feminine virtues with politics (non-violence, patience, perseverance)
- **Tactics**: Speaking truth to power, showing moral mirror to mighty opponent

##### Institutional Development

##### Major Issues

- Increasing role of women in public life
- Voting rights for women (franchise/suffrage)

##### Assessment

- **Resounding success**: After independence, constitutional provisions and Hindu personal law reforms granted much of what women were demanding
- **Consequence**: Women's movement went into lull for about two decades

#### Third Phase (1970s-1980s)

##### International Context

- **UN Declaration**: 1976-1985 declared as International Decade for Women
- **Government report**: "TOWARDS EQUALITY" report (1974) by INDIRA GANDHI government
- **Key finding**: Constitutional promise of gender equality not realized in social life

##### Two Strands of Movement

**1. Local Struggles**

- Rural women, tribal women, slum dwelling women participated enthusiastically
- **Examples**: CHIPKO movement, anti-price rise agitation in Maharashtra, anti-arrack movement in Andhra Pradesh

**2. Educated Urban Women (Bhadralok Mahila)**

- **Women's safety**: Gang rape since NIRBHAYA incident
- **Women's reservation bill**: Major issue now achieved

## ANALYSIS OF RAPE AS SOCIAL ISSUE (161:11)

### Understanding Rape Beyond Sexual Desire

- **Common misconception**: Rape is for sexual pleasure or unrealized sexual desire
- **Reality**: For sexual satisfaction, transactional sex (prostitution) is available
- **Core nature**: Rape is about power and control - assertion of male dominance over women

### Scholarly Analysis

#### SUBRATA's Dichotomy Theory

- **Social structure**: Dichotomy between private sphere and public sphere
- **Traditional assignment**: Women considered as belonging to private sphere
- **Modern challenge**: With modernization, women venturing into public sphere for education and jobs
- **Backlash**: Sexual harassment and rapes are backlash from patriarchal society
- **Mindset**: Women rightly belong at home; if she's out, she wants sex

### LAKSHMAN REKHA Concept

- **Definition**: Boundary that women are not expected to cross
- **Drawn by**: "Honorable, concerned, trustworthy men" - fathers, brothers, husbands
- **Consequence**: If women cross LAKSHMAN REKHA, adverse consequences await (like SITA had to face)
- **Control mechanism**: Helps men exert control over women's mobility, dressing sense

### Forms of Rape

#### Marital Rape

- **Legal status**: Not criminalized in Indian society
- **Government position**: MANEKA GANDHI (Minister for Women and Child Development) stated Indian society's social climate not conducive for criminalizing marital rape
- **KAMLA BHASIN's analysis**: Man considered as owner of wife; women regarded as property, men as owners
- **Linguistic evidence**: Terms for husband in Indian languages (PATI, SWAMI, PRANLATH) indicate ownership and control

### Victim Blaming and Social Attitudes

#### Language and Shame

- **Hindi terminology**: Rape called terms that focus on victim losing honor
- **Shame assignment**: Shame belongs to victim, not perpetrator
- **Social perception**: Biggest shame for girl to have been raped
- **Victim blamed for**: Dressing, drinking, being out at odd times, somehow provoking or inviting rape

#### Political Leaders' Attitudes

- **MULAYAM SINGH YADAV**: "Boys will be boys. They make such petty mistakes"

### Systemic Issues

- **Police force**: Lack of women (low conviction rate in rape cases)
- **Conviction rates**: Very low in rape cases

### Toxic Masculinity

#### Concept Development

- **Scholars**: MICHAEL FLOOD, CLEMENTINE FORD
- **Definition**: Excessive expectations of excessive masculinity from men
- **Expected traits**: Very aggressive, dominant, go-getters, tough, daring, competitive
- **Link**: Toxic masculinity linked to misogynistic attitudes, sexual harassment, and rape

#### Cultural Manifestations

- **Peer pressure**: Expected to commodify women, use terms like "item girl"
- **Popular cinema**: Projects and promotes toxic masculinity
- **Language**: Misogynistic jokes, objectification normalized
- **Pressure**: Men declared "not man enough" if they don't conform

### Rape as Political Tool

- **Core insight**: Rape is only an extreme manifestation of widespread culture of misogyny and degradation of women in society
- **Political dimension**: Rape used as political tool

#### URVASHI BUTALIA's Documentation

- **Context**: Communal riots during partition of India
- **Pattern**: Women of all communities (Hindu, Muslim, Sikh) raped by men of other communities
- **Purpose**: One community exerts dominance over other, shames the other
- **Logic**: Preserving sexual purity of women considered prime importance for community honor

### Death Penalty Debate

#### Feminist Opposition

- **Across the board**: Feminists have opposed death penalty for rape
- **Reasons**:
  1. Rape victim may be killed to escape death penalty
  2. Conviction rate already very low; judges will be more circumspect with death penalty
- **Feminist demand**: Emphasis on certainty of punishment, not severity of punishment
- **Goal**: High conviction rates rather than extreme punishment
