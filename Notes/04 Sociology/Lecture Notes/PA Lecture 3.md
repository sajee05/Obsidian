# Sociology Lecture: What is Society and Culture & Emergence of Sociology

## RECAP AND INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY (17:06)

**Quick Recap from Previous Lecture:**

- **Social groups** can be of various types such as primary and secondary (classification given by CHARLES HORTON COOLEY)
- Groups can also be classified into **in-groups and out-groups** (classification by WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER - WG SUMNER)
- **In-groups**: Strong attachment
- **Out-groups**: Some sort of hostility
- **Membership and non-membership**: Self-explanatory categories
- **Social relationships**: We engage in client and seller, mother and child, husband and wife relationships
- These **recurrent and patterned social relationships** give rise to **social institutions**

**Major Social Institutions:**
- Education system
- Family  
- Religion
- Economy
- Polity

**Social Processes:**
- Modernization
- Globalization
- Urbanization

**AUGUSTE COMTE's Definition:**
- Sociology is the study of **social statics and social dynamics**

## NATURE OF THE DISCIPLINE OF SOCIOLOGY (22:17)

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Focus on Aggregates**: Focuses more on aggregates, collectivities and larger entities than on the individual
   - With the writings of MAX WEBER and onwards there was also an increased focus on micro-level analysis in sociology

2. **Descriptive vs Prescriptive**: It is more descriptive than prescriptive
   - It is not what society ought to be, but analyzes the society which already exists
   - Critical researchers and this strand was there since the beginning even in the writings of COMTE and DURKHEIM
   - They were writing in the context of the turmoil of the French revolution, concerned about restoring order and stability in society

3. **Scientific Method**: Uses scientific methods
   - Today it uses a mix of both scientific and non-scientific methods

4. **Pattern Identification**: Focuses more on identifying patterns and arriving at generalizations than on unique events
   - Beginning with WEBER, sociology also started focusing on unique events

5. **Human Focus**: Focuses on human societies and human social institutions rather than those in the animal kingdom
   - However, sociology does not completely ignore the animal world

6. **Interconnected Study**: Studies things as interconnected rather than in isolation

**GINSBURG's Definition of Social Institutions:**
- **Social institutions** are recognized and established usages governing relations between individuals and between groups
- Any social relationship is governed by certain societal dos and don'ts - rules laid down by the society
- They become a part of the collectively accepted social behavior in that context

## WHAT IS SOCIETY (32:23)

**Basic Definition:**
- **Sociology** is the study of society (in no more than five words)

**Various Definitions of Society:**
- A group of people living together
- A group of people with some sort of interdependency between them  
- A specific group of people living in a fixed territory, having some sort of psychic unity and a definitive culture

**Why Can't One Person Constitute a Society:**

**ARISTOTLE's Insight**: "Man is a social animal"

**Reasons for Human Interdependence:**
1. **Basic Human Needs:**
   - Need for food (need somebody to grow things)
   - Biological need for sex
   - Propensity to reproduce
   - Sense of security
   - Emotional well-being
   - Companionship
   - Need to be loved
   - Sense of belongingness
   - Need for validation

2. **Societal Influence on Individual Life:**
   - The kind of food we eat
   - The kind of clothes we wear
   - One's mode of worship or thoughts about divinity
   - One's whole personality
   - One's self-perception
   - Everything is greatly shaped by the society

**Society Shapes Individuals:**
- Society plays a very significant role in shaping individuals

## MEMBERS OF YOUR SOCIETY (45:01)

**Who Are Part of Your Society:**
- Friends
- Neighbors
- Colleagues  
- Parents
- Siblings
- Romantic and sexual relationships
- Relatives
- Dharmaguru
- Political leaders
- Teachers
- Shopkeeper
- Doctor

**Focus on Relationships:**
- What is more important is not these individuals per se, but their **social relationships**
- It is the **web of interpersonal relationships** which makes society

**MACIVER's Definition:**
- **Society is a web of interpersonal relationships**
- Web terminology indicates how cross-cutting social relationships are

## SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN SOCIETY (48:42)

**Similarities Amongst Members:**
- Common language
- Same cast ⭐ (should be "caste")
- Almost same religion (most belong to Hinduism in India)
- Sense of nationalism
- Same citizenship
- Governed by same set of laws
- Same political leadership
- Similar food habits
- Similar festivals
- Similar clothing
- Similar values

**Importance of Similarities:**
- Society is characterized by several similarities amongst its members
- These similarities are essential for social life
- Based upon these similarities people are able to live together, develop consensus
- There can be cooperation amongst the members of the society

**Differences Amongst Members:**
- Different food habits
- Different music preferences
- Different languages
- Different festivals  
- Different religious beliefs
- Class differences (inequality based on wealth)

**Importance of Differences:**
- People have different capabilities and skill sets
- People's varied skill sets enable them to fulfill each other's needs
- Differences enable division of labor or skill specialization
- Differences facilitate complementarity
- Differences facilitate coordination and cooperation
- Fundamental difference between sexes (men and women) enables sexual needs satisfaction and reproduction

**Both Cooperation and Conflict:**
- Society is characterized by cooperation based on similarities and differences
- Society is also conflict-ridden with ethnic conflicts, class conflicts, communal conflicts, ideological conflicts
- Both seemingly contradictory trends are present in any ongoing society

## CULTURE (61:20)

**Understanding Culture:**
- **Culture** is a way of life
- Every society has its own culture

**E.B. TYLER's Definition:**
- **Culture is that complex whole which includes knowledge, beliefs, art, morals, customs and any other capabilities acquired by man as a part of society**

**Components of Culture:**
- Language
- Rituals
- Food habits
- Sense of dressing
- Architecture
- Customs
- Beliefs
- Dance forms
- Music
- All aspects of life inherited from previous generation

**Culture vs Nature:**
- **Culture** can be contrasted with **Nature**
- Culture is **man-made**, a human invention
- What is endowed by nature is not culture

**Examples:**
- Language: Culture
- Clothing: Culture  
- Tree: Nature
- Tree worship: Culture

**Characteristics of Culture:**
1. **Man-made**
2. **Shared amongst members of a society**
3. **Transmitted from one generation to the next**
4. **Dynamic and evolving** (not set in stone)
5. **Living entity** (not necessarily ancient)

**Modern Cultural Elements:**
- WhatsApp is now part of our culture
- Valentine's Day is part of Indian culture for urban middle class youth
- Technologies we use are part of culture
- Mobile phones are part of culture

**Cultural Transmission:**
- There can be transmission of cultural elements from one society to another
- Culture is not necessarily ancient but can be newly adopted

**RALPH LINTON's Definition:**
- **Culture of a society is the way of life of its members**

**CLYDE KLUCKHOHN's Definition:**
- **Culture is a design for living**

**Subcultures:**
- Within a society, different subgroups may have distinct subcultures
- Hindu culture differs from Muslim culture or Christian culture or Jain culture
- Different castes may have their own distinctive subcultures
- Notion of culture doesn't presuppose complete homogeneity

## FORMAL DEFINITION OF SOCIETY (77:28)

**Complete Definition:**
- **Society is a group of people in interaction with each other, who typically live in a common territory, and share a common culture**

**Modern Considerations:**
- Thanks to digitalization and migration, the element of territory is becoming less salient
- Society can be deterritorialized and not confined to a given territory

## EMERGENCE OF SOCIOLOGY (96:00)

**Timeline of Academic Establishment:**

| Year | Event | Person/Place |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1838 | Term "sociology" coined | AUGUSTE COMTE |
| 1875 | First course in sociology introduced in USA | WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER |
| 1892 | First department of sociology established in USA | ALBION SMALL |
| 1895 | First department of sociology in Europe established | EMILE DURKHEIM (University of Bordeaux, France) |

**Key Question: Why in the 19th Century?**
- The discipline of sociology was established in the 19th century
- Why not in 13th century or 7th century or 21st century or 3rd century BC?
- What necessitated or led to the establishment of the discipline of sociology?

## MODERNIZATION OF EUROPE AND EMERGENCE OF SOCIOLOGY (111:38)

**Historical Context:**
- With the French and industrial revolutions, old European society crumbled and was replaced by modern society
- It was to make sense of this process of modernization and find solutions to associated problems that sociology emerged
- None of the existing branches of knowledge seemed adequate to understand these transformative changes
- Need was felt for a discipline dedicated to the scientific study of society

**Prior Study of Society:**
- Society was being studied before sociology's establishment by:
  - Philosophers (SOCRATES, ARISTOTLE, PLATO)
  - Lawgivers and statesmen
  - Rulers
  - Men of religion
  - In India: Rishis, BUDDHA, MANU
  - In China: CONFUCIUS

**Why New Discipline Needed:**
- Changes were so transformative that existing branches seemed compartmentalized and narrow
- Economists focused on economy, political scientists on polity, men of religion on religion
- New society was fundamentally different, requiring scientific study

## THE FRENCH REVOLUTION (114:42)

**Timeline and Location:**
- Took place in France in the second half of the 18th century

**Pre-Revolution French Society:**

**The Estates System:**
- **First Estate**: Clergy (priestly class, church officials)

- **Third Estate**: Commoners (the jamaadat)
- **Above all**: The monarch - LOUIS XVI (Bourbon dynasty)

**Demographics:**
- First and second estates comprised less than 3% of France's population
- Overwhelming majority were members of third estate

**Social Conditions:**
- All power and privilege concentrated in first two estates
- Life of commoners characterized by increasing hardships
- French state supported American revolutionaries against English, burden fell on third estate
- Heavier taxation imposed on third estate
- Price rise and high inflation
- Basic essentials became out of reach of common people
- Monarchy seen as distant and disconnected (MARIE ANTOINETTE's "let them eat cake")

**Emerging Middle Class:**
- Middle class emerged from commoners who made wealth through enterprise and trade
- They felt their interests not taken care of in feudal order
- Joined hands with commoners against monarchical feudal order

**Consequences of French Revolution:**

1. **Political Changes:**
   - Royal family beheaded
   - Monarchy abolished
   - France declared a republic

2. **Religious Changes:**
   - Powers of church curtailed significantly
   - Separation of church and state (secularism)
   - Breaking of nexus between church and state authority

3. **Social Changes:**
   - Privileges of feudal lords taken away
   - Feudal lords could no longer maintain private armies

4. **Ideological Changes:**
   - New ideals adopted: **Liberty, Equality, Fraternity**
   - These were radical ideas for that time
   - Earlier people believed in inherent inequality of human beings
   - Earlier people were bound by custom, religion, authority figures
   - Collectivity reigned over individual
   - Liberty tied with growth of individualism

**Impact:**
- Large scale transformation with chaos and disorder
- Many founding fathers of sociology are French: COMTE, SAINT-SIMON, DURKHEIM
- All writing about transformative changes and post-revolution chaos

## THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION (136:04)

**Timeline and Location:**
- Began in England (approximate timeline varies among scholars)
- Started with textiles production and invention of spinning jenny
- Later spread to every segment of English economy

**Definition:**
- **Mechanization of production**
- Shift from human/animal labor power to employment of machinery in production

**Economic Impacts:**

1. **Production Changes:**
   - Quantum of production increased manifold
   - Production efficiency increased greatly
   - Same goods produced in far less time with lesser input
   - System of mass production of standardized goods
   - Per unit cost of production decreased
   - Things became more affordable

2. **Consumption Culture:**
   - Development of consumption culture
   - Shopping promoted as pleasurable activity

   - Necessary for sustaining industrial production

3. **Trade and Markets:**
   - Increase in international trade and commerce
   - Scramble for new markets and cheaper raw materials
   - Led to further colonization

**Social Impacts:**

2. **Urbanization:**
   - Large scale migration from rural to urban areas
   - Factories became city centers
   - Rural economy became increasingly unviable

3. **Family Changes:**

   - In agriculture-based economy, joint family sustained
   - With industrialization, people assigned jobs based on skills
   - Different family members go to different places for work
   - Nuclear families easier to move than extended families

4. **Urban Living Conditions:**
   - Growth of slums in industrial cities
   - Slums: overpopulated, poor hygiene, poor sanitation, dilapidated
   - Problem of pollution and new diseases
   - Workers suffered from loneliness and isolation

   - Still one of two main political parties in Great Britain
   - Articulates interests of working class

3. **Education System:**
   - Development of mass-based education system
   - Scientific and skill-based education instead of religious instruction

4. **Stratification Changes:**
   - Earlier: lords and serfs
   - New social classes: factory owners and factory workers

5. **New Ideologies:**
   - Development of ideologies like communism

**Global Impact:**
- French Revolution ideals spread like wildfire globally
- Inspired constitutions including US Constitution and Indian Constitution  
- Industrial Revolution spread from England to other European countries, North America, Latin America
- Whole globe underwent industrialization in varying degrees
- This was only the first industrial revolution, followed by second, third, fourth, and fifth

**Conclusion:**
- Traditional Europe gave way to modern Europe
- Changes were near total - old society crumbled, new society arose
- Old branches of knowledge grossly inadequate to understand changes
- Changes were tumultuous, chaotic, gave rise to numerous social problems
- Need felt for discipline dedicated to scientific study of society
- Sociology established to understand and find solutions to these problems
