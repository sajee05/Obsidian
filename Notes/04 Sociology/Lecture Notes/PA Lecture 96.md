# Environmental Sociology, Ideological Frameworks, and Constitutional Changes in Indian Society

## Introduction and Sustainable Development Critique (15:00)

- The lecture begins with a discussion on environmental sociology and sustainable development
- **Sustainable Development Definition**: When we take developmental measures without compromising the needs of our future generation, it is called sustainable development
- **BRUNDTLAND REPORT** gave the classic definition of sustainable development
- The concept has come under various criticisms as follows:

### Criticisms of Sustainable Development

**1. RAMESH DIVAN's Perspective:**

- The term sustainable development is **a contradiction in terms**
- Development and sustainable do not go hand in hand
- Development means increase in levels of consumption, increase in levels of production, increase in the ability to exploit natural resources
- You cannot have something called sustainable development - any development model will end up doing something to nature, disturbing its pristine state

**2. SUKHOMOY CHAKRAVARTY's Critique:**

- The notion of sustainable development is **not precise**
- It has been too widely defined
- The 17 Sustainable Development Goals cover disparate things - zero hunger, poverty, literacy, forest management, air, water - everything is covered
- It's too broad and therefore vague as a concept

**3. K.R. NAYYAR's Political Argument:**

- This notion of sustainable development is **a political instrument of the West**
- Western countries have themselves developed unsustainably but now they are trying to prevent the development of developing countries
- Using this concept of sustainable development to slow down progress
- The notion is **intrinsically anti-poor and anti-South** (Global South)

## Ecological Protests and Movements (28:00)

### Definition and Characteristics

- **Ecological Movements**: People's protests to assert their right to control and manage natural resources like land, forest products, water, etc.
- These movements are largely **localized** - confined to particular areas with local issues and local participants
- No national level or all-India environmental movement exists
- Large number of disparate groups launching protests separated in space and time

### Key Examples of Ecological Movements

**Water-related Protests:**

- **NARMADA BACHAO ANDOLAN** - against Sardar Sarovar Dam
- **TUNGBHADRA DAM** - 35,000 people were displaced and 35 hectares land was submerged
- **TEESTA DAM** protests in West Bengal

**Forest-based Movements:**

- **Tendu leaf collectors** movement in Madhya Pradesh, Central India
- **CHIPKO MOVEMENT** led by SUNDERLAL BAHUGUNA

**Pollution-related Protests:**

- **COCA-COLA plant protests** in Kerala
- **Atomic power plants protests** in Tamil Nadu
- **Fishermen protests against trawlers** in Tamil Nadu

### Common Features of Ecological Movements

**1. Two Main Parties in Conflict:**

- **Local people**: Tribals, villagers, fisherfolk communities, village women
- **Large corporations**: Seeking profit maximization with insatiable greed for greater profits

**2. Different Approaches to Resource Use:**

- **Local populations**: Have symbiotic relationship with nature, extract using traditional methods on smaller scale, sustainable fashion, ages-old claims, issues of survival/sustenance
- **Corporations**: Operate on far larger scale, environmentally destructive methods, seeking profit maximization, relatively new claimants to resources

**3. Role of the State:**

- Indian state has been largely **siding with corporates**
- Diverting resources away from local communities to private sector for commercial exploitation
- Local people protesting against state action

### Methods Employed in Protests

**Largely Gandhian Methods:**

- **Bhookh hartal** (hunger strike)
- **Rasta roko** (road blockade)
- **Chakka jam** (bringing city to halt)
- **Gherao** (encirclement)
- **Rail roko** (preventing railway operation)
- **Jal samadhi** (standing in rising water levels)
- **Pad yatra** (long marches) - Example: SUNDERLAL BAHUGUNA's Kashmir to Kohima march

**Media and Communication:**

- **Skillful use of media** - writing extensively in leading newspapers
- **Oral communication** - KERALA SHASTRA SAHITYA PARISHAD used street theater (nukkad natak)
- **Digital activism** - social media campaigns, Twitter trends like #Save

### Effects of Development-Induced Displacement

- **Loss of livelihood** among displaced people
- **Tribal identity being wiped out** as tribals depend on forest resources
- **Tribal economy disrupted**
- **Unable to fit into newer job opportunities**
- **Rehabilitation and resettlement packages not implemented properly**
- **Increasing cases of indebtedness and landlessness**
- **Loss of culture**
- **ARUNDHATI ROY** states that more than 50 million people have been displaced since independence - three times the amount displaced during partition

## Ideological Dimensions of Ecological Movements (56:00)

### Three Main Ideological Stands

**1. Gandhian Approach:**

- **GANDHI's famous quote**: "The world has enough for everyone's needs but doesn't have enough for a single person's greed"
- Gandhi was against **mindless excessive consumption**
- Gandhi was against India blindly adopting the **Western model of mass production and mass consumption**
- Western lifestyle was excessive and wasteful unnecessarily
- **Gandhi's philosophy**: Simple living and high thinking (sada jeevan uchch vichar)
- **Based on minimalism** - adoption of simple lifestyle
- Gandhi wanted Indian villages based on traditional technologies like **charkha**
- Simple living, close to nature, in harmony with nature
- Gandhi was a nature lover and tried to incorporate nature in his life
- **Leaders following Gandhian approach**: SUNDERLAL BAHUGUNA, ANNA HAZARE, BABA AMTE

**Solution from Gandhian Perspective:**

- Let nature heal itself
- Don't rapaciously exploit resources for industrial mass production
- Adoption of simple lifestyle and low levels of consumption

**2. Marxist Approach:**

- **The problem is not the quantum of resources** - Mother Nature is bountiful, there are enough resources
- **The problem is inequitable distribution and control over resources**
- Resources are being controlled by the **capitalist class**
- Capitalists have systematically deprived the masses of access to resources in their quest for profits
- **Capitalists' greed is insatiable**
- Capitalists are exploiting resources at very fast pace resulting in environmental and social problems
- **Who bears the cost of environmental degradation?** The masses, the poor, the wretched of the earth

**Solution from Marxist Perspective:**

- Requires **armed confrontation and elimination of the class enemy**
- Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains
- **Example in India**: The NAXALITE MOVEMENT

**3. Appropriate Technologists Approach:**

- **Core argument**: The technological base and production system that the Industrial Revolution in the West created was in accordance with socioeconomic conditions of Western countries
- We have blindly replicated those models in India resulting in all sorts of problems
- **Need to develop appropriate technologies** - suitable to our specific conditions

**Difference in Conditions:**

- **In the West**: Capital is cheap, labor is costly, so they developed capital-intensive machinery and automated processes
- **In India**: Capital is costly (9-10% annual interest rate), labor is cheap, but we're using technologies that won't employ people
- **What we need**: Low on capital, high on labor technologies
- **Western technologies were**: Resource wasteful (they had access to colonies), but we don't have colonies

**Characteristics of Appropriate Technologies:**

- **Labor intensive**
- **Small scale**
- **Decentralized** 
- **Energy efficient**
- **Resource conserving**
- **Require low capital**
- **Socially liberating**
- **Environmentally sustainable**

**Perfect Example**: **PADMAN movie** - Akshay Kumar's character develops low-cost sanitary pad making machine instead of importing expensive technology, engaging rural women, creating employment, solving problems at low cost

## Ecofeminism (79:00)

### Core Concept by VANDANA SHIVA and MARIA MIES

- **Ecofeminism argues**: Women's issues and environmental concerns are not two separate concerns - they are intimately interlinked
- **Book reference**: "ECOFEMINISM" by VANDANA SHIVA and MARIA MIES

### Historical Perspective

**In Ancient Vedic Period:**

- **Women played important role in production system**
- **Production was in sync with nature**
- **Man, woman and nature existed in harmony**
- **Nature was worshipped in feminine form** as Prakriti
- **Women and nature were considered life-giving, life sustaining, nurturing**
- Women in roles as mothers, bearers and rearers of children, custodians of kitchen
- **Both women and nature were given adequate respect** in Vedic Hindu culture

**Over Time - The Problem:**

- **Women got displaced from production system**
- **Women were driven out of economy** 
- **Twin problems of patriarchy and environmental degradation began** when men took over production system
- New production processes emerged that were increasingly environmentally unsustainable
- **Environmental degradation and patriarchal control both worsened significantly**

### Analysis in VANDANA SHIVA's Works

**Books**: "STAYING ALIVE" and "EARTH DEMOCRACY"

- **Violence against women and environmental destruction has intensified with imposition of neoliberal economic policies**
- **Globalization promotes patriarchal capitalism** and is decidedly unjust, unfair and undemocratic
- **In Western patriarchy**: Women are regarded as weak, dependent, vulnerable and inferior
- **Western patriarchal principles are being imposed in India through globalization**

**Current Problems:**

- **Women's work is devalued** in patriarchal capitalism
- **Women's bodies are commodified** in advertising, media, pornography
- **Definition of work is patriarchal** - what men do is regarded as work, what women do is disregarded
- **Economic vulnerability of women makes them susceptible to sexual assault**
- **Women's indigenous knowledge and role in biodiversity conservation is ignored**

**The Solution:**

- **Women should regain center stage in economy**
- Need to restate central position of women in production process
- So that we can once again regain balance between man, woman, economy and nature
- **"Rape of earth is taking place akin to rape of women"**

### Key Example from Agricultural Context

- **Traditional division of labor existed**: If man was reaping crop, women were sowing seeds; if man was working fields, women were handling dairy
- **Women's role was central** but over time they have been sidelined in production system
- **Male-dominated production system is ecologically insensitive**
- When women become part of economy, a sort of balance is restored in relations between humanity and nature

## Green and Saffron Concept (100:00)

### MUKUL SHARMA's Analysis

- **Book**: "GREEN AND SAFFRON" by MUKUL SHARMA
- **Green stands for**: Environmental movements and ecology
- **Saffron stands for**: Hinduism and Hindutva
- **Core argument**: Over period of time in India, there has been **greening of saffron and saffronization of green**

### Saffronization of Green

**Definition**: Ecological movements are increasingly using Hindu motifs, imagery, and symbols in their campaigns

**Examples:**

1. **World Wildlife Fund Mathura-Vrindavan Revival Project**: 
   
   - Environmentalists projected **Bhagwan Krishna as conservationist and nature lover**
   - Krishna often portrayed in green surroundings with animals in natural environment

2. **SUNDERLAL BAHUGUNA's Public Meetings**:
   
   - In Tehri Garhwal region working for cleaning Ganga river
   - Would address Ganga as **"Ganga Maiya"** (Mother Goddess)
   - How devout Hindus connect to and consider Ganga

3. **ANNA HAZARE in Ralegan Siddhi**:
   
   - Conducted meetings in **village temples**
   - Hindu context to many environmental campaigns and movements

### Greening of Saffron

**Definition**: Hindutva political movement increasingly taking up environmental themes and causes

**Examples:**

- **Cow protection** - ecological concern and animal conservation, major concern for Hindutva forces
- **Namami Gange program** by Hindutva government
- **Ram Setu protection** - environmental dimension and Hindu sensitivities

### MUKUL SHARMA's Critique

**Problems with Saffronization of Green:**

- **Exclusionary effect** - tends to exclude certain communities
- When BAHUGUNA referred to Ganga as "Ganga Maiya", **local Muslims stood up and left his meetings**
- They could not connect with or identify with Ganga as mother goddess
- When meetings conducted in temples with strict Brahmanized Hindu code
- **Liquor consumption prohibited**, caste-based discrimination
- Those communities and villagers who consumed liquor were excluded

## Constitution, Law and Changes in Indian Society (122:00)

### Has Indian Constitutional Framework Brought Significant Changes?

**Positive Changes Identified:**

1. **Reservation Policy**: 
   
   - Given voice to marginalized sections (SCs, STs, OBCs)
   - Greater representation to previously excluded groups

2. **Constitutional Provisions Against Discrimination**:
   
   - No discrimination on basis of religion, caste, place of worship, class
   - Though social reality may differ from constitutional provisions

3. **Common Citizenship and Rule of Law**:
   
   - Fostered sense of unity across linguistic, class and other divides

4. **Freedom of Religion**:
   
   - Secular fabric of society maintained
   - Freedom to profess and propagate any religion

5. **Women's Rights Improvements**:
   
   - Various pro-women provisions brought greater gender parity
   - Right to property, freedom to select spouse
   - Though actual enjoyment may vary

6. **Transition in Governance**:
   
   - Very visible change from monarchical to democratic and representative government

7. **Legal Framework Benefits**:
   
   - Laws act as agent of social control
   - Deterrent against crimes like sexual harassment, murder
   - Justice systems functioning (example: Nirbhaya case)

### B.R. AMBEDKAR's Vision

- **AMBEDKAR** chaired the drafting committee of Constitution
- Believed Indian Constitution has **revolutionary potential**
- **Revolutionary potential means**: Can bring about changes through bloodless means that other societies achieved through revolution
- **"It can bring about a bloodless coup and effect large-scale social transformation"**

**Radical Concepts in Constitution:**

- **Notions of equality** in widest possible sense
- **Justice** - social, economic and political
- **Liberty** of speech, expression, thought, assembly across caste, gender, region, religion, class, sex
- **Very formidable document** that can bring about major changes in collective lives

### Current Question: Has Revolutionary Potential Been Realized?

**Areas of Significant Progress:**

- **Dalits can enter temples** (previously not allowed)
- **Can sit together in classrooms**
- **Restaurants open to all** (earlier had "Brahmin only" restaurants in places like Tamil Nadu)
- **Deepening of democracy**
- **Land reforms** 
- **Spread of education**
- **Greater participation of marginalized sections** in politics and administration
- **Promotion of scientific temper**

**Areas Where Change Remains Limited:**

**Despite Progressive Laws:**

- **Dowry continues to increase** with every subsequent generation, even communities that didn't practice it earlier now do
- **Sex-selective abortions** continue despite legal prohibition  
- **Manual scavenging** continues despite laws against it
- **Equal pay for equal work** continues to be violated
- **Child labor** persists despite protective provisions

### MARK GALANTER's Analysis

**Book**: "LAW AND SOCIETY IN MODERN INDIA"

**Key Observations:**

1. **Several provisions of legal system are at odds with central values and beliefs of Indian society and culture**
   
   - Example: Law permits interfaith marriages, intercaste marriages, but nearly all communities believe in endogamy
   - People's thinking is in stark contrast to legal framework

2. **Despite this, legal framework in India has flourished**
   
   - Legal system has remained robust and grown
   - India has retained same Constitution (quite remarkable compared to neighbors)
   - Even western countries like France have frequent changes
   - Nepal still trying to figure out their constitution

3. **Efficiency depends not only on judges and lawyers but also on citizens**

### Problems in Effective Implementation

**1. Judicial Backlog:**

- **Shortage of judicial officers/judges**
- **About 70-75,000 cases in Supreme Court**
- **About 4.5 crore cases in all courts across India** ⭐ (Different figures mentioned - needs verification)
- **Criminal case average time: 5 years**
- **Property cases: intergenerational** - parents file, grandchildren get decisions
- **Outdated technology** - slow adoption of online systems

**2. Legal Illiteracy Among Citizens:**

- **People largely unaware** of laws, even educated sections lack legal literacy
- **Law's dictum**: "It is assumed that people subject to it are in the know of it"
- **Many men unaware** that domestic violence is punishable offense
- **Traffic law violations** due to ignorance of consequences
- **Property rights awareness lacking** - people may not know women's right to father's property

**Fundamental Principle:**

- **"Any law is only as good as its implementation"**
- Law not meant to be just piece of paper
- Can have positive effect only if properly implemented

### C.N. VENUGOPAL's Observations

- Many things have not changed despite progressive legislation
- There is endurance and stubborness associated with several features of social life

**Examples of Persistent Issues:**

- **Crime against women rising** despite legal protections
- **Few women police personnel** to handle women's issues  
- **Legal provisions benefit capitalists** more effectively than intended beneficiaries
