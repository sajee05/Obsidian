## Understanding Social Stratification (35:56)

### Basic Definition and Characteristics

- **Social stratification**: Refers to the presence of social groups ranked hierarchically one above the other in terms of different amounts of power, prestige and property that their members possess

### Three Key Criteria for Stratification

| Criteria            | Description                            | Example                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Power**           | Control and authority over others      | Political leaders, bureaucrats                        |
| **Prestige/Status** | Dignity or respect accorded by society | Caste hierarchy - Brahmans superior to Sudras         |
| **Property/Wealth** | Economic resources and income          | Class system - Upper class, middle class, lower class |

### Examples of Stratification Systems

- **Caste System**: Hierarchy primarily of prestige/dignity
  
  - Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras hierarchically arranged
  - Within each varna, several castes exist
  - Example: Baniya caste lies in Vaishya varna; Rajputs belong to Kshatriya varna

- **Class System**: Hierarchy primarily of wealth/money
  
  - Upper class have more money than middle class who have more than lower class
  - Universal system present in all societies

- **Gender**: Universal basis of stratification
  
  - Men dominate over and exploit women across all societies (patriarchy)

### Members of Strata Characteristics

Members of a strata may have:

- **Common interests**: Capitalist class interest - keep wages down and maximize profits; Proletariat interest - wage maximization
- **Common lifestyle**: Different castes have different lifestyles and food habits
- **Self-identification**: Awareness that they belong to that particular strata or category

## Scholarly Definitions (73:01)

### MELVIN TUMIN's Definition

- **Social stratification**: An arrangement of social groups into a hierarchy of positions that are unequal with regard to power, property, social evaluation, or psychic gratification

### GILBERT's Definition

- **Social stratification**: The division of society into permanent groups or categories linked with each other by relationships of superiority and subordination

### SOROKIN's Perspective

- **The unstratified society is a myth**: It has never existed in the history of mankind
- Social stratification is inevitable, universal, and present in every society

## Functional Theory of Social Stratification (78:26)

### Core Arguments

According to functionalist friends, social stratification is:

- **Universal**: Present in every society
- **Inevitable**: A society cannot exist without stratification  
- **Functional**: Beneficial for the society

### TALCOTT PARSONS' Approach

- **Value Consensus**: In every society, members agree upon shared norms and values
- **Collective Goals**: From shared norms and values, society identifies certain collective goals
- **Different Contributions**: People differ in terms of their skills and abilities, contributing differently towards collective goals
- **Differential Rewards**: Society rewards people based on their different contributions with varying amounts of power, prestige, and property

#### Examples of Value-Goal Relationships

| Society Type     | Shared Value               | Collective Goal              | High Contributor            | Reward                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| American Society | Materialism                | Material prosperity/progress | Bill Gates                  | Greater power, prestige, wealth |
| Primitive Tribal | Physical strength/bravery  | Survival/protection          | Strong warriors             | Tribal chief position, respect  |
| Traditional      | Male children reproduction | Continuation of lineage      | Women bearing male children | Higher status                   |

## DAVIS AND MOORE's Theory of Stratification (90:09)

### Paper Title: "Some Principles of Stratification"

### Core Premise

- **Stratification is universal** because it fulfills a **functional prerequisite**: **Effective role allocation and performance**

### Effective Role Allocation and Performance

This functional prerequisite means:

1. **Different roles exist in society** - Prime minister, doctor, teacher, sweeper, bureaucrat, peon, cleaner
2. **All roles must be filled** by competent persons who have the capability to perform those roles
3. **Training requirements** - Some roles require long periods of training, especially functionally more important tasks
4. **Motivation needed** - People should be motivated to perform their roles diligently

### Mechanism of Stratification System

#### How Stratification Ensures Effective Role Allocation

1. **Differential Rewards**: Society attaches different amounts of power, prestige, and wealth to different social roles

2. **Higher Rewards for Important Roles**: Society attaches higher rewards to functionally more important roles

3. **Motivation Creation**: These differential rewards serve to attract a large number of aspirants for the functionally more important roles

4. **Selection of Capable**: Those who have greater ability or competence will be selected for these more important roles

5. **Compensation for Training**: High rewards compensate for the loss of income undertaken during long periods of training

6. **Performance Motivation**: High rewards keep the incumbent motivated to perform their role diligently

7. **Social Integration**: The stratification system keeps society integrated as those lower in the system accept the authority of those above them

#### Example: Civil Services Examination

- **Motivation**: If IS officer and office peon had same respect/power, people wouldn't strive for the arduous selection journey
- **Training Compensation**: Students prepare for at least 2 years, foregoing potential income (₹50,000/month = ₹12 lakh loss over 2 years)
- **Selection Logic**: High rewards attached to IS position justify taking this income loss risk
- **Authority Acceptance**: Those who don't clear the exam generally accept the authority of those who do

## Criticisms of Functional Theory (129:26)

### ANDRE BET's Criticism

- **Nature vs. Nurture Argument**: Functionalists assume people are naturally unequal, but nature makes people **different**, not **unequal**
- **Social Construction**: Natural differences get converted into inequalities through a social or cultural process
- **Examples**: 
  - Height differences exist, but society decides taller is better
  - Skin color varies, but society determines fair is more beautiful
  - Muscle mass differs, but society values it differently for men vs. women

### ROUSSEAU's Criticism

- **Natural vs. Social Inequality**: Natural inequalities are relatively small and unimportant
- **Accident of Birth**: Social stratification is not based on natural inequalities but on accident of birth
- **Examples**:
  - Wealth determined by being born rich, not intelligence
  - Male power exists due to being born male by chance
  - Background determines social rewards more than natural abilities

### Conflict Theory Perspective

- **Ignores Oppression**: Functional theory ignores the oppression and exploitation which is an outcome of stratification
- **Legitimization**: It legitimizes inequalities in society
- **Power Abuse**: Prestige and power rewarded to roles often enables holders to oppress and exploit the weak

### Limited Applicability

- **Closed Societies**: Theory cannot explain stratification in closed societies
- **Caste Example**: Cannot justify Brahminical privilege over lower castes since positions are determined by birth, not ability

### MELVIN TUMIN's Detailed Critique

#### 1. No Objective Measurement of Functional Importance

- **Comparison Problem**: No objective way of measuring or comparing functional importance of different social roles
- **Examples of Difficult Comparisons**:
  - Soldier vs. CEO
  - Doctor vs. Manager  
  - Prime Minister vs. Chief Minister
  - Primary teacher vs. College teacher
- **Circular Logic**: People assume highly rewarded roles are more important, rather than important roles being highly rewarded

#### 2. Talent Pool May Not Be Limited

- **Assumption Challenge**: DAVIS AND MOORE assume talent pool is limited
- **Reality Check**: In a country of 130+ crore people, only 30 persons annually selected as civil servants - talent pool may be much larger
- **Implication**: May not require high rewards if talent pool is wider than assumed

#### 3. Training Has Its Own Rewards

- **Alternative Benefits**: Long periods of training and preparation may offer other benefits
- **Personal Development**: Compared to corporate jobs, civil service preparation offers:
  - Widening of horizons
  - Personality development
  - Freedom from rigid schedules
- **Early Career Compensation**: Any loss during training can be made up in early career years
- **Question**: How are high rewards throughout entire career justified?

#### 4. Prevents Selection of Most Suitable

- **Contradiction**: Instead of selecting most capable, stratification prevents selection of most suitable persons
- **Civil Services Example**: 
  - Current aspirants come from middle/upper-middle strata
  - Most disadvantaged sections don't get equal chance
  - More capable people from lower strata may be excluded
- **Talent Waste**: Best talent from lower strata gets wasted rather than utilized

#### 5. Demotivation Effect

- **Opposite of Claimed**: Rather than motivating, stratification demotivates many highly capable people
- **Economic Barriers**: Capable people from lower strata:
  - Cannot spare 3-5 years without earning income
  - Are forced to take survival jobs
  - Never aspire for top positions despite having ability

#### 6. Divisive Rather Than Integrative

- **Social Division**: Stratification is a divisive force rather than integrative
- **Lower Strata Response**: Those in lower strata:
  - Don't have full faith in society/existing system
  - Are suspicious and distrustful of social order
  - Receive unfair treatment from society
- **Reduced Commitment**: People's commitment to shared values becomes lowered

## Studies on Universality of Stratification (157:01)

### Israeli Kibbutz System Study by EVA ROSENFELD

#### Kibbutz Characteristics

- **Resource Ownership**: All resources communally owned
- **Distribution Principle**: From each according to ability, to each according to needs  
- **Wealth Equality**: Inequalities in terms of wealth eliminated

#### Findings

- **Two Clear Strata Identified**:
  1. **Leaders and Managers**
  2. **Ordinary Members of Kibbutz**
- **Inequality Persists**: Leaders/managers enjoyed greater prestige and power than ordinary members
- **Conclusion**: Even without private property, stratification existed

### Eastern Block Countries Study (161:21)

#### Context

- **Cold War Period**: Countries based on Marxist principles
- **Expected Outcome**: Should have been egalitarian societies

#### Scholars and Findings

**FRANK PARKIN and MILOVAN DJILAS Studies:**

- **Clear Stratification**: Clearly identifiable strata existed even in Eastern Block countries
- **New Class**: DJILAS identified a "new class" that ruled in Eastern Block

#### MILOVAN DJILAS - "New Class" Book

**Background:**

- **Former Communist**: Was President of Yugoslavia, committed communist
- **Attempted Reforms**: Tried to make communism more democratic, open, participatory
- **Removed from Power**: Thrown out for attempted changes
- **Became Dissident**: Wrote book as former insider critic

**Key Arguments:**

- **New Ruling Class**: A new class rules in Eastern Block which is more exploitative than bourgeoisie in the West
- **Totalitarian Nature**: Eastern regimes are totalitarian with concentration of power
- **No Checks**: No countervailing mechanisms or checks on their power
- **Power Concentration**: All power concentrated in party machinery vs. West where power is dispersed among economic elites, politicians, civil society, media, multiple political parties
- **Unlimited Power**: Those controlling party machinery enjoy unlimited power

**Consequences:**

- **Imprisonment**: Sentenced to 7 years in prison for writing this book
- **Ideological Descent**: Imprisoned not for corruption but for ideological dissent

## Marxist Theory of Stratification - Recap (166:05)

### Basic Structure

- **Two Main Strata**: Haves and have-nots
- **Class Definition**: Determined by ownership or non-ownership of means of production
- **Capitalist Era Classes**:
  - **Capitalists**: Those who own capital
  - **Proletariat**: Those who don't own capital, must sell their labor

### Class Relationship

- **Antagonistic Cooperation**: Relationship between two main classes
- **Mutually Incompatible Interests**: One class gains only at expense of the other
- **Example**: If workers benefit from higher wages, capitalists lose out

### Social Change Mechanism

- **Class Struggle**: Society changes through struggle between main classes in every epoch
- **Capitalist Mode Process**:
  - Petite bourgeoisie sinking into proletariat
  - Class polarization occurring
  - False class consciousness replaced by true class consciousness
  - Proletariat transforms from class in itself to class for itself
- **Final Outcome**: Revolution (peaceful or bloody)
