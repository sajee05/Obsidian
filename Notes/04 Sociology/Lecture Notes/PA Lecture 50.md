# Major Theoretical Strands of Research Methodology

## Sectional Test Discussion (15:05)

### Question 1: Pattern Variables

- **Pattern variables**: Does not need any elaboration - straightforward PARSONS's theory

### Question 2: Class, Status and Party

- **Class, status and party**: Again straight from WEBER - no elaboration required

### Question 3: Nuclear Family Analysis (16:24)

- **Question 1C**: "The nuclear family is increasingly a thing of the past" - explain
- **Approach**: First and foremost, it is asking you to explain. So you don't have to contest or argue against this idea. It's a given that nuclear family is a thing of the past. And you have to explain why is this statement being made.

**Key Points to Cover:**

- Various reasons why the nuclear family is becoming a thing of the past
- Various ways in which nuclear family is becoming a thing of the past
- **Examples**: Rise of single parent households, same-sex unions - these are new forms of new living arrangements, living relationships. All these are displacing the nuclear family as the norm
- **Statistics**: Only about one-third of all families were of the conventional nuclear type in UK
- **Reasons**: What ANTHONY GIDDENS calls plastic sexuality - because now sex and reproduction have been separated thanks to contraceptive technology, societal norms are changing, laws are changing. So there is greater acceptance of homosexuality for instance

### Question 4: DURKHEIM's Theory of Suicide (18:22)

- **Structure**: Begin by defining, mentioning the book's name, defining suicide, then very briefly either explaining his theory in a paragraph or simply portraying it diagrammatically, and then its critical examination

**Critical Examination Requirements:**

- When you do critical examination of any theory or concept it entails both an appreciation and a criticism
- What many of you end up doing is only criticism which is not a full or proper critical evaluation
- **Appreciation**: In this theory or in this work DURKHEIM demonstrated the application of the scientific method for the first time systematically. This notion that suicide is a psychological phenomena was challenged
- **Criticisms**: Then also criticisms which we've talked about earlier

### Question 5: WEBER's Theory of Bureaucracy (19:35)

- **Question**: "How does WEBER's theory of bureaucracy analyze the potential for both efficiency and dehumanization within bureaucratic organizations?"

**Structure Recommended:**

1. **Introduction**: Begin by describing what bureaucracy is - standard hierarchical rational organization
2. **Subheading**: "Bureaucracy as an efficient organization"
   - Predictability, control mechanisms, separation of personal and professional
   - Because of which there is increasing calculability, rationality etc.
   - Because of which there is high degree of efficiency
3. **Subheading**: "Dehumanization in bureaucracy"
   - Talk about iron cage, excessive rationalization
4. **Conclusion**: Despite acknowledging its limitations or its potential for dehumanization, WEBER was of the view that there will be further bureaucratization or spread of bureaucracy because of how efficiently it performs large scale complex tasks

### Question 6: Poverty Analysis (21:28)

- **Statement**: "It is impossible to get rid of poverty" - critically evaluate this statement

**Approach for Critical Evaluation:**

- Both something which seems to support this argument and something which kind of opposes it
- **Agreement section**: Why it is impossible to get rid of poverty
  - According to HERBERT GANS: Every society needs some mechanisms to ensure that the dirty tasks, the menial tasks get done. It provides a baseline for failure. It assures people of their self-worth
  - **MARXIST view**: Even if countries become very rich because it serves the vested interest of the capitalists it helps to keep wages low
- **Counter-argument**: "However significant reductions in poverty have been achieved by various societies"
  - Job guarantee schemes, minimum wage, minimum income programs, social security mechanisms
  - Economic growth can significantly contribute to poverty reduction
  - Concepts: Multi-dimensional poverty, AMARTYA SEN's notion, relative poverty, absolute poverty

### Question 7: Deviance and Homosexuality (25:04)

- **Part A**: What is deviance? - Do not confine it to only the introduction. Let the first part get some more treatment than merely being defined
- **Definition expansion**: 
  - It can be positively sanctioned or negatively sanctioned
  - CLINARD suggested that we should only consider those acts which are punished and beyond the tolerance limits of the society
  - What constitutes deviance is culture specific - varies from society to society and also in a society from one time to another

**Part B: Homosexuality as Deviant Behavior**

- **Objective approach**: It's not a moral position that you are taking here
- **Analysis**: Homosexuality in many societies and cultures is considered as a deviant form of sexual behavior
- **Historical perspective**: 
  - MICHEL FOUCAULT - History of Sexuality: It was over the past few centuries that the west began to take an interest in the world of perversions
  - Earlier sex talk was confined to straight sex, heterosexual sex for reproduction
  - They then began to criminalize and medicalize homosexuality
- **Theoretical framework**: 
  - Queer theorists like JUDITH BUTLER, GAIL RUBIN argue that homosexuality is regarded as a deviance due to heteronormativity and homophobia prevalent in several societies
- **Changing attitudes**:
  - Societal norms or attitudes towards homosexuality are not fixed
  - In Indian society scholars like RUTH VANITA, SALEEM KIDWAI have pointed out how in pre-colonial Indian society homosexuality was greatly talked about and discussed
  - It was only the colonial era Victorian ideology due to section 377 that in Indian society also homosexuality began to be seen as a deviance
  - Due to changing sexual norms, legislative enactments, progressive judgments and legislations, the LGBT rights movement, societal attitudes towards homosexuality are changing

### Question 8: COMTE and DURKHEIM's Role (30:53)

- **Role outlined**: These philosophers were instrumental in establishing sociology as an academic discipline in Europe in the 19th century in response to changes brought about by the French and industrial revolution

**COMTE's Contributions:**

- Coined the term sociology - therefore regarded as the founding father of modern sociology
- Laid down the framework for positive philosophy
- Talked about that sociology is the study of social statics and social dynamics thereby outlining the contours changes in the society and how stability and order is maintained in society
- The law of evolution: theological to metaphysical to positive

**DURKHEIM's Contribution:**

- Functionalism - functional theory framework
- Subject matter distinctly clearly outlined as social facts
- First department of sociology established, first journal of sociology in Europe
- Rules of sociological method - how this subject matter is to be approached or studied
- Suicide - exemplified how this subject matter can be analyzed or studied scientifically
- Seminal contribution to sociology of religion, understanding division of labor, economic changes

### Question 9: MARX and DURKHEIM on Division of Labor (33:48)

- **Begin**: By defining division of labor and how MARX and DURKHEIM approached its analysis in different ways

**Comparison Framework:**

| Aspect                    | DURKHEIM                                                                                      | MARX                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cause**                 | Rise in volume and material density - to regulate competition in society to manageable levels | Outcome of technological improvements and necessity of capitalists to appropriate surplus                             |
| **Perspective**           | Functional analysis                                                                           | Conflict perspective                                                                                                  |
| **Outcome**               | Organic solidarity, increased interdependence, cooperation, harmony                           | Alienation, exploitation, appropriation, oppression, conflict                                                         |
| **Problems Acknowledged** | Certain pathological forms of division of labor                                               | Problem of alienation - workers trapped in narrow occupational roles                                                  |
| **Solutions**             | Emergence of contract, establishment of professional associations, state playing certain role | Proletariat revolution, establishment of communism where workers will no more be trapped in narrow occupational roles |

**Convergences:**

- Both acknowledged the importance of division of labor
- Both viewed its impact to be far beyond only the economy - it had a societal impact not just confined to economy as classical economists like ADAM SMITH saw it
- Both were analyzing the nature of work in their theories of division of labor in early industrial capitalism in Europe

### Question 10: Science and Religion Relationship (38:03)

- **Statement**: "While science is expanding, so is religion" - analyze the relationship between science and religion in light of this statement

**Structure:**

1. **Introduction**: Modernization theory, secularization theory (BRIAN WILSON, AUGUST COMTE, MAX WEBER) considers the rise and popularization of science and technology as one of the key reasons for the decline of religion in modern society. However, what we witness today is that even as science and technology continue to grow and expand, religion is also once again very important in social life - what we call resacralization

2. **Technology facilitating religion**: 
   
   - Tele evangelism
   - Transportation technologies facilitating religious tourism
   - Online congregations, online worship
   - All requires technology for the propagation or connecting with religion

3. **Theoretical framework**: According to IAN BARBER (When Science Meets Religion) - there are four ways in which this relationship between science and religion can be understood - the four models

### Question 11: Sociology as Value Free Science (40:52)

- **Question**: "Is sociology a value free science?" - Evaluate
- **Approach**: Talk various dimensions not one dimension - Positivism perspective

## Introduction to Major Theoretical Strands (51:00)

- **Context**: We are done with the unit on work and economic life
- **Remaining topics**: 
  - Labor and society
  - TAYLOR knowledge workers
  - PETER DRUCKER contemporary society
  - Gig workers, informal labor, formal labor
  - Unit 2: Sociology as science, major theoretical strands of research methodology
  - Unit 3: Research methods and analysis
  - Unit 1: Sociology and common sense, comparison of sociology with other subjects, scope of sociology

## Structural Theories vs Social Action Theories (54:04)

### Two Broad Approaches in Sociology

**Structural Theories:**

- **Definition**: Those which see a definitive structure in the society
- **Key principle**: According to structural theories, human action is shaped by, determined by the social structure
- **Social structure**: Determines, shapes, controls human behavior
- **Examples**: 
  - **FUNCTIONALISM**: Society has well-laid out structure - family, religion, stratification system as different parts. The actions of the individual are controlled by the social structure through socialization and social control
  - **MARXISM**: Also a structural view of society

**Social Action Theories:**

- **Definition**: Consider that there is no rigid well-defined social structure
- **Key principle**: According to social action theories, social action is what shapes the society. Rather than being shaped by the society, social action shapes the society
- **Alternative view**: The society is a product, is an outcome of social actions
- **Focus**: These theories emphasize upon the study of social action and the meanings that men attach to their actions
- **Examples**:
  - **MAX WEBER**: Interpretative sociology - the purpose of sociology is to interpret the meaning that men attach to their actions. WEBERIAN interpretative sociology is a social action theory
  - **SYMBOLIC INTERACTIONISM**: Also a social action approach

## Positivism vs Anti-Positivism (62:01)

### Research Methodology Approaches

**Structural Theories → Positivism:**

- **Method**: Structural theories advocate the application of scientific method, scientific research methodology to study society
- **Assumption**: They consider that society can be studied scientifically
- **Position**: They vouch for the application of scientific research methodology to study society - they are positivists

**Social Action Theories → Anti-Positivism:**

- **Position**: Anti-positivist
- **Core argument**: The scientific method which is applied in the natural sciences is not appropriate to study society
- **Approach**: Interpretative sociology

### WEBER's Position

- **Link**: WEBER is a link between positivism and anti-positivism
- **Stance**: WEBER does not entirely reject the scientific enterprise
- **View**: WEBER's view is that the scientific method alone is not adequate to fully study social reality
- **Additional methods**: Apart from the scientific method according to WEBER, we need to apply other methods like verstehen, ideal types to study society
- **Objectivity**: Should strive for objectivity, but it can never be fully objective
  - The selection of the topic of research is value relevant - affected by the social background and value preferences of the researcher
  - But subsequent research, the sociologist must strive to keep aside their values and ensure that they do not contaminate the research

## Symbolic Interactionism and Dramaturgy (67:00)

### Key Scholars in Symbolic Interactionism

- **G.H. MEAD**
- **HERBERT BLUMER** 
- **C.H. COOLEY**
- **IRVING GOFFMAN**: His theory specifically is known as dramaturgy

### IRVING GOFFMAN's Dramaturgy (67:48)

**Core Concept:**

- **Book**: "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life"
- **Approach**: Outlines the dramaturgical approach to the study of society
- **Type**: This approach is a type of interactionist view of society
- **Basic analogy**: It compares everyday life to theater or drama

**Key Elements of Dramaturgy:**

**Actors and Roles:**

- According to this approach, various social actors are like actors in a play
- Their social behavior is akin to a theatrical performance
- Different actors are playing specific roles

**Impression Management:**

- During their performance, the actors want to present certain qualities to the audience (the outside world) and hide some other qualities
- Thus actors are engaged in impression management
- That is they want to present themselves in a presentable manner and offer a consistent image to the audience

**Front Stage and Back Stage:**

- **Front stage**: Actors perform on the front stage before an audience
  - Their performance is affected by the responses of the audience
  - Similarly in society when people are performing their respective social roles, what they do is also greatly influenced by their interactions with others
- **Back stage**: Actors unwind and relax at the backstage
  - Similarly in social life, individuals relax during periods of solitude or when with their near and dear ones

**Props and Preparation:**

- Theatrical performances require thorough prior preparation and rely upon props
- Similarly in life people undergo lengthy periods of socialization to prepare for their various social roles
- In life too people rely upon their dress, mannerisms, speech etc. to present the image that they want to others

## Phenomenology (98:03)

### Philosophical Foundation

- **Definition**: Phenomenology is a European philosophy developed by HUSSERL and further refined by ALFRED SCHUTZ
- **Core premise**: According to phenomenologists, there is no objective social reality
- **Alternative view**: People construct their own social reality

### Key Concepts

**Sensory Experience and Classification:**

- Human beings come into contact with the outside world through their senses such as sight, hearing, touch, etc.
- What they perceive through their senses are a wide array, are a huge variety of experiences
- To make sense of these diverse sensory experiences, human beings classify them upon the basis of some common characteristics

**Examples of Classification:**

- We classify objects as living and non-living
- We may further classify living beings into humans and non-humans  
- We may further classify human beings as men and women, rich, poor and so on and so forth based on class, based on race classificatory schemes
- By classifying various phenomena into such categories, we are able to make sense of the world around us

**Nature of Classification:**

- Such classification is not objective i.e. it is not true or false. It simply is
- It's a product of human mind
- HUSSERL therefore denies that any objective external social reality exists

### Typifications (ALFRED SCHUTZ)

- **Definition**: SCHUTZ suggests that people use typifications i.e. certain concepts by which they label different classes of things
- **Examples**: Teacher, doctor, tree, dog - these are all typifications
- **Shared nature**: These typifications are not unique to a person, they are shared by the members of a society
- **Transmission**: These are passed down to children through language

**Function of Typifications:**

- Phenomenologists suggest that by using typifications people are able to communicate with each other and develop some shared assumptions about the world around them
- Such shared assumptions are necessary for practical day to day living
- Phenomenologists deny the existence of an objective external reality
- However, phenomenologists consider that between themselves people create a shared illusion of reality

## Ethnomethodology (125:35)

### Definition and Etymology

- **Developer**: Ethnomethodology is a sociological theory developed by HAROLD GARFINKEL
- **Etymology**: 
  - Ethnos = people (group of people)
  - Method = method
  - Ology = study of
  - **Literal meaning**: To study the methods used by the people

### Philosophical Foundation

- **Relationship to phenomenology**: Following SCHUTZ, ethnomethodologists believe that there is no real social order
- **Social construction**: Members of the society construct their own social reality
- **Methods used**: To construct their social reality, people use common sense, everyday experiences and practical reasoning

### Research Focus

- **Sociologist's role**: Sociologists should study the methods that people use to construct their social reality
- **Daily analysis**: Sociologists should analyze how people on a daily basis accomplish everyday tasks

### Two Central Ideas

**1. Indexicality:**

- **Definition**: It means that things make sense only as per the context
- **Application**: Therefore, members of the society decipher the meaning of anything based on the context
- **Example**: If somebody says "you're looking very nice" - the meaning depends on context:
  - Said by someone who has had a crush since 8th grade = genuine compliment
  - Said by someone who has been bullying for 5 years = sarcastic/mocking
  - Said by a parent = different meaning than from someone of same age, opposite gender

**2. Reflexivity:**

- **Core principle**: Ethnomethodologists contend that members of the society need a sense of order
- **Process**: Therefore, they create order during conversations
- **Reality creation**: Order really doesn't exist but is created by individuals who seek it
- **Continuous process**: We are continuously reflecting upon what the other guy is saying during conversation and making sense of it

### GARFINKEL's Counseling Experiment

- **Setup**: Students were told they would have counseling sessions with a psychologist via telephone
- **Condition**: Counselor would only respond with "yes" or "no"
- **Reality**: Responses were given by a machine with pre-programmed yes/no answers in predetermined order
- **Results**: Many students found these counseling sessions very useful
- **Significance**: Students were able to create meaning where none existed - they sought meaning and created order where none existed

### Ethnomethodological Study of Suicide (ATKINSON)

**Contrast with DURKHEIM:**

- **DURKHEIM's approach**: Using scientific method - collected statistics, clearly defined suicide, classified suicide into various types
- **ATKINSON's approach**: From ethnomethodological perspective

**Key Arguments:**

- **Question posed**: Can we count on suicide statistics? No
- **Reason**: Suicide is not an objective reality - suicide is a constructed reality
- **Process**: There are all kinds of deaths, but some deaths are considered as suicide, classified as suicide by members of society who are involved such as police officers, medical practitioners, family members etc.

**Research Focus:**

- **What to study**: Sociologists should study the methods that people use to classify some deaths as suicide and others as non-suicide
- **Basis**: How do people classify deaths as suicide and non-suicide? Based on common sense
- **Common sense theory**: We all have some common sense theory of suicide in our minds including police officers investigating a death, medical practitioners, family members

**Examples of Common Sense Classifications:**

- **Mental state**: Depressed person vs happy person - more likely to classify depressed as suicide
- **Method of death**: Death by poison vs bullet through head - poison more likely classified as suicide  
- **Location**: Death inside home with doors locked vs middle of road - home death more likely suicide
- **Age**: 30 years old vs 80 years old - 30 more likely suicide, 80 more likely natural death

**Negotiated Process:**

- Classifications are not given but negotiated between different persons
- There will be negotiations, exchange, arguments, counterarguments and then a death might be classified as suicide, non-suicide, murder, natural death, accident, whatever
