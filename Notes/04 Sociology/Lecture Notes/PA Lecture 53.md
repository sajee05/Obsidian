## CASE STUDIES IN SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH (21:02)

### Definition and Basic Understanding

- **Case Study**: A very detailed thorough study of a particular case and a particular instance
- Instead of studying many instances of that phenomena, we study one instance in great depth
- Case studies are a popular method in various domains of knowledge like ethics papers, law, business schools, and management studies

### Examples of Case Studies

- **Ethics Papers**: Given a certain situation with a 360-degree view of causes, people involved, options, etc.
- **Law and Business Schools**: Case studies are extensively relied upon
- **Management/Business Studies**: 
  - Coca-Cola launching a new variant and market response
  - Hero Honda plant in Gurgaon facing industrial strike and violence
  - Detailed study of factors, participants, and outcomes

### Utility in Sociological Research

#### Initial Concerns About Case Studies

- Question: Why should we confine ourselves to one instance of a particular phenomena if we have to understand the whole of society?
- One instance will hardly give us anything about the whole of society
- How does studying one particular event make us richer in terms of understanding society?

#### Arguments for Case Studies in Sociology

**1. To Disprove Generalizations and Make Comparisons**

- **MARGARET MEAD's Study**: "Coming of Age in Samoa"
  - Studied Samoan islanders to understand adolescence
  - In American society: adolescence characterized by anxiety, turmoil, rebellion, deviant sexual behavior, drugs
  - Question: Is this biological (due to bodily changes) or cultural?
  - **MEAD's Findings**: Samoan teenage girls were well-adjusted, did not experience the same turmoil as American teens
  - **Conclusion**: It was a cultural thing, not biological; human personality is remarkably malleable
  - Many things considered biological, innate, and genetic are actually shaped by culture

**2. To Understand Atypical Phenomena**

- **BARKER's Study**: Case study of the cult MOONIES
- Cults are atypical phenomena - considered deviant form of religion, not mainstream
- Ordinary people and researchers do not have easy access to or familiarity with workings of a cult
- One case study of MOONIES gives insight into how cults work and life as a cult member

**3. To Formulate Limited Generalizations**

- **KAREN HEATH's Study**: Retail chain study
  - Found positive correlation between beer sales and diaper sales
  - **Explanation**: When women asked husbands to buy diapers in evenings/nights, men considered it an opportunity to also buy couple of beers
  - **Business Application**: Retail chains started stocking diapers and beers together for smoother purchase experience and higher sales
  - **Limited Generalization**: Similar behavior can be expected in other retail stores

**4. To Develop Concepts with Wider Applicability**

- **M.N. SRINIVAS's Study**: Village in Karnataka
  - Based on study of one village, developed concept of **SANSKRITIZATION**
  - **Sanskritization**: Lower castes imitating aspects of lifestyle of higher castes
  - **Wider Application**: After Srinivas, several other researchers working in other villages throughout the country also observed sanskritization
  - Also developed concept of **DOMINANT CASTE** which had wider application beyond that particular village

## BIOGRAPHY AND LIFE HISTORY IN RESEARCH (24:17)

### Definition and Scope

- **Biography/Life History**: Detailed study of life of a particular person
- Question: Should we in sociological research also be studying biographical sketches?
- Concern: This is too much detail - we are concerned with study of aggregates, social groups, social institutions, big picture

### Arguments Against Biographical Studies

- Should we spend too much time understanding details of life of particular person?
- Are they of any utility in sociological research?

### Arguments for Biographical Studies

**1. Understanding Influential Individuals**

- Some people leave their stamp on society
- They are so impactful that their life, thinking, ideology has bearing for whole society
- Example: GANDHI - his thoughts have bearing on modern Indian nation
- In interpretive sociology, we focus on individual level

**2. Developing Community Profiles**

- Instead of focusing on prominent persons, focus on ordinary persons
- Example: If studying UPSC preparation experience through life histories of 20-30 students from different backgrounds
- **Purpose**: Understanding psychological processes at individual level
- Taking several individuals of particular social grouping (ethnic group) gives profile of that group
- Provides better idea of common culture of society

### Historical Example: THOMAS AND ZNANIECKI

- **Study**: "The Polish Peasant in Europe and America"
- **Method**: Using biographical sketches to develop profile of Polish immigrants to American society
- **Data Collection**:
  - Went through more than 10,000 personal letters
  - Used information from about 750 letters
  - Relied on newspaper articles about community members
  - Used official records (educational records, certificates, criminal records if any)
  - Interviewed near and dear ones
  - Spoke at length with subjects
- **Approach**: Developed biographical sketch of persons and used it to create profile of community

### Understanding Deviance Through Biography

- **ROBERT BOGDAN's Study**: Biographical sketch of JANE FRY (a transsexual person)
- **Purpose**: Develop understanding of transsexualism from perspective of transsexual person
- Rather than imposing views and understanding of mainstream society
- **Key Finding**: JANE FRY considered transsexualism as normal, not a disease
- Contrast with mainstream society's view of it as disease and abnormality
- For JANE FRY, transsexualism was very natural, came very naturally to her

### Life-Altering Impact of Biographical Research

- **MARIA MIES's Research**: Developed life histories of female victims of domestic violence
- **Process**: During research, many victims developed much richer, better understanding of their own social condition
- **Key Realization**: 
  - Many female victims used to blame themselves for violence
  - Common feeling: "I would have done something wrong to provoke him"
  - **Through Research**: Victims realized causes were societal, not their own doing
  - Understanding that causes were rooted in structure of society
  - Society condones violence against women; various causes including financial dependence of women on men
- **Impact**: This realization was liberating and empowering for those victims

## METHODOLOGY VS METHODS (65:22)

### Distinction Between Terms

- **Frequent Usage**: Terms methods and methodology are often used interchangeably
- **Conceptual Distinction**: There is a distinction between the two
- **Relationship**: Methods are part of methodology

### Understanding Methodology

- **Methodology**: Broader term that dictates and lays down the approach towards research
- **Definition**: A body of rules, assumptions, and procedures that are employed while conducting research in a discipline
- **Function**: Lays down procedure to be followed during research given some fundamental assumptions about nature of phenomena under investigation

### Methodology Components

- **Includes Methods**: But also includes basic assumptions
- **Basic Assumptions**: Guide and dictate why that method is used
- **Examples of Assumptions**:
  - In scientific method: Social reality is empirically capturable, observable
  - Human beings' actions are predictable, not random or arbitrary
  - Governed by social factors, shared norms and values (functionalist language)
  - For Marxists: Economic factors emphasized over shared norms and values
  - Society determines what individuals do; individual behavior is quite predictable

## QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (72:22)

### Alternative Names

- **Also Known As**:
  - Positivist methodology
  - Scientific methodology

### Key Characteristics

**1. Core Approach**

- **Involves**: Obtaining statistical data, finding correlations, establishing causation, developing generalizations
- **Emphasizes**: System of scientific investigation of quantitative properties of phenomena
- **Generates**: Quantifiable image of social reality

**2. Data Format**

- **Data Form**: Numbers, statistics
- **Results Representation**: Graphs, pie charts, tables

### Methods in Quantitative Research

**1. Experimentation Method**

- **Definition**: Manipulating variables in controlled environment
- **Lab Experiments**: Very artificially created situations
  - Limited utility in sociological research
  - Very few social situations amenable to lab-type reproduction
- **Field Experiments**: More popular in sociological research
  - Study social phenomena taking place in field
  - Can go and observe, collect data
  - Researchers do manipulate variables like in lab experiments
  - **Example**: HAWTHORNE STUDIES
    - Researchers wanted to capture impact of changes in work conditions (lighting, temperature) on worker productivity
    - Instead of bringing them to lab-type artificial environment, went to factories where workers are working
    - Manipulated variables (changed lighting, temperature) and observed effect on worker productivity

**2. Field Experiments - Additional Example**

- **SEASHORE Study**: Field experiment similar to modern social media experiments
  - First dressed as poor man (dirty, crumpled) and measured people's response to calls for help
  - Then dressed as upper middle-class gentleman and observed how people's response changed
  - **Purpose**: Understanding how physical appearance affects people's helpfulness

### Problems with Field Experiments

1. **Real Life Consequences**: Can have significant real-life impacts
2. **Multiple Variables**: Several variables may impact outcome which may be very difficult to control for researcher
3. **Contamination**: Experiment may be contaminated by variables beyond researcher's control

**Examples of Uncontrollable Variables**:

- Weather conditions during different phases of experiment
- Time of day when experiment conducted
- Type of community passing by (religious vs. corporate)
- Floating population in streets

**3. Comparative Method**

- **Definition**: Involves comparison of different societies and social groups
- **Key Principle**: Should compare things which are comparable
  - Compare apples with apples, not apples with oranges
  - Example: Compare women in US with women in India; religious minorities in US with religious minorities in India
- **Historical Usage**: Has been greatly applied in sociological research since time of founding fathers
  - **DURKHEIM**: Compared suicide rates of men and women, people of different religious communities
  - **WEBER**: Compared impact of religious beliefs on economic behavior in different cultures

## QUALITATIVE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (91:47)

### Critique of Quantitative Research

- **Proponents' View**: Scientific methodology is not adequate and not appropriate to study social reality
- **Problem with Quantitative**: Cannot capture meanings, motives, etc. of social actors
- **Missing Elements**: Deeper insight, standard units, meanings, motives of social actors

### Key Characteristics

**1. Core Approach**

- **Involves**: Analysis and interpretation of observations
- **Purpose**: To identify underlying meanings and motives
- **Focus**: Subjective orientation of social actors
- **Data Generation**: Qualitative data in form of words

**2. Methods Used**

- Participant observation
- Ideal type
- Ethnomethodology
- Unstructured interviews
- Focus group discussions
- Content analysis
- Projective techniques

### Content Analysis

- **Definition**: Analyzing content of communication
- **Focus**: Who says what to whom, when, and how
- **Elements Analyzed**:
  - Not just what is being said, but how it is being said
  - When it is being said
  - Who says first, who says next
  - Pauses during speech also convey meaning
  - Tone conveys many things
  - Who interrupts whom in communication process
- **Power Dynamics**: Interruption patterns reveal power dimensions during conversation

### Projective Techniques

- **Purpose**: Gauge state of mind of research subjects
- **Method**: Researcher tries to assess psychological state
- **Example**: Ink blot tests
  - Put blot of ink on blank paper, fold paper, then open it
  - Ask subject what they see
  - Interpretations: If see bat = this type; if see heart = deprived of love
  - Read into psychological state based on patterns subjects decipher from arbitrary figures

| **Data Collection**          | Surveys, structured interviews, census           | Focus group discussions, unstructured interviews, content analysis, projective techniques |
| **Generalizations**          | Enables researchers to arrive at generalizations | Difficult to arrive at generalizations; only limited generalizations possible             |
| **Insight Depth**            | Less deep insight                                | Offers deeper insight                                                                     |
| **Information Organization** | Very organized, systematic manner                | Less systematically organized                                                             |

### HINDESS's Critique of Qualitative Research

- **Particularly Critical Of**: Ethnomethodology and phenomenology
- **Famous Quote**: "A monkey sitting on a typewriter is likely to produce more useful output than what ethnomethodologists do"
- **Reasoning**: 
  - Cannot arrive at any sort of generalizations and conclusions using ethnomethodological research
  - Ethnomethodologists deny existence of concrete social reality altogether
  - Ethnomethodologist interpretation of social reality is just another version of it
  - Not too different in value than layman's interpretation of social world

### Contemporary Methodological Pluralism

- **BRYMAN's Suggestion**: Contemporary research and sociology is characterized by methodological pluralism
- **Current Practice**: Researchers now regularly combine different methodologies including quantitative and qualitative during research
- **Triangulation**: Combining different methods or research techniques

### Benefits of Multiple Methods (Triangulation)

**1. Increased Confidence**

- Increases confidence in research findings

**2. Hypothesis Generation and Testing**

- Qualitative research can help to generate hypothesis which can then be tested using quantitative research

**3. Fill Data Gaps**

- Can help to fill any gaps in data
- **Example**: BARKER's MOONIES study - limited information gathered through observation, supplemented with other methods

**4. Enable Generalizations**

- Qualitative research cannot make generalizations
- Can combine quantitative research to arrive at some sort of generalizations

## FEMINIST RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (121:17)

### Critique of Mainstream Research

- **Feminist Researchers' View**: Quite critical of mainstream research
- **Claim**: It is not mainstream research, it is "malestream" research
- **Argument**: Mainstream sociological research is dominated and controlled by men

### Problems with Mainstream Research

**1. Male Domination**

- Most researchers are men
- Issues taken up are issues which concern men
- Language employed uses terms like "man," "mankind" for all persons

**2. Male Samples**

- All male samples are used by researchers
- **CAROL SMART's Observation**: Sociological research on crime and deviance relies on statistics pertaining to men
- **Examples**: R.K. MERTON, ALBERT COHEN, and other dignitaries of field relied on all male samples while developing theories and conclusions regarding crime and deviance

**3. Patriarchal Principles**

- Mainstream research is based on patriarchal principles
- Not just that men dominate research, but men with patriarchal mindset and orientation
- Most mainstream researchers have patriarchal mindset
- Consider gender inequality and exploitation as given, natural, biologically determined

**4. Gender Classification Issues**

- **MICHELLE STANWORTH's Critique**: Mainstream researchers assign women to social class based on class of their husband
- **Problem**: In patriarchal society, husband has ready source of income and property ownership; woman does not

**5. Language and Representation**

- **MARGARET EICHLER's Point**: Terms like "man" and "mankind" are used for people in general
- **ANN OAKLEY's Observation**: Sociological research has often excluded and ignored issues which are of concern to women
- Ignored or downplayed contribution of women to society
- **Example**: Sociology of work ignored work done by women inside homes - care work, domestic chores

### OAKLEY's Alternative Methodology

**Critique of Scientific Method**

- Very critical of scientific method popular in mainstream sociology
- **Problem with Scientific Method**: Over-emphasis on cold objectivity and maintaining arm's length distance from research subjects
- **Positivist Requirement**: Researcher must maintain distance from research subjects to prevent contamination of data

**Proposed Feminist Methodology**

- **OAKLEY's Suggestion**: Feminist research needs its own distinctive methodology
- **Key Principle**: Researcher establishes intimate and personal relationship with research subjects
- **Approach**: Instead of maintaining cold objectivity and distance, researcher should form very warm, intimate relationship with those being researched

**OAKLEY's Research Example**

- **Study**: Pregnancy and motherhood experience
- **Method**: During research, OAKLEY began sharing her own experiences of pregnancy and motherhood with subjects
- **According to Positivists**: This was biggest sin - contaminating data by imposing personal experiences
- **OAKLEY's Findings**: When she opened up about her own experiences, research subjects became far more forthcoming
- **Result**: Started doing collaborative research - no longer "my research" but joint research
- **Outcome**: Subjects developed active interest in research, which helped the research
- **Long-term Impact**: Many research subjects stayed in touch long after research ended; literally became friends

## VARIABLES IN RESEARCH (152:47)

### Definition

- **Variables**: Those parameters whose value changes as situation changes

### Types of Variables

**1. Dependent Variable**

- **Characteristic**: Changes only when it is related with something else (other variable)
- **Relationship**: Will change when independent variable changes

**2. Independent Variable**

- **Characteristic**: Independent of any other effect
- **Role**: Causes change in dependent variable

### Examples of Variable Relationships

**Physics Example**:

- **Force and Acceleration**: When you change force, amount of acceleration produced changes
- **Independent Variable**: Force
- **Dependent Variable**: Acceleration

**Biology Example**:

- **Plant Growth and Sunlight**: Measuring how plant growth changes with amount of sunlight
- **Independent Variable**: Sunlight exposure
- **Dependent Variable**: Plant growth
- **Logic**: Sunlight exposure does not change with change in plant growth, but plant growth changes with change in sunlight exposure

**Sociological Examples**:

- **Education and Income**: 
  - Hypothesis 1: "An increase in education levels results in increase in income levels"
    - **Independent Variable**: Education level
    - **Dependent Variable**: Income level
  - Hypothesis 2: "Higher the income level of family, greater is educational attainment of child"
    - **Independent Variable**: Income
    - **Dependent Variable**: Educational attainment

### Importance in Research

- **Critical Role**: Variables are an important aspect in sociological research
- **Research Process**:
  1. **First**: Researcher has to identify the variables
  2. **Second**: Establish which is dependent variable and which is independent variable
  3. **Third**: Establishes linkage between variables
  4. **Finally**: Researcher will change value of independent variable and observe effect it produces on dependent variable, keeping other things constant

**DURKHEIM's Suicide Study Example**:

- **Dependent Variable**: Suicide rate
- **Independent Variables**: Marital status, number of children, gender, religious affiliation, place of residence (urban/rural)
- **Method**: Change these independent variables and observe what changes occur in suicide rates

## RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY (163:35)

### Reliability

**Definition**

- **Meaning**: Consistency of outcome
- **In Research**: A research tool and method is considered reliable if by using same tool and method, other researchers will produce same result

**Example**

- **Weighing Scale Scenario**:
  - Scale 1: Same sack of potatoes shows 70kg for person A, 100kg for person B, 40kg for person C
  - Scale 2: Same sack shows 70kg for person A, 71kg for person B, 69kg for person C
  - **More Reliable**: Scale 2 (consistent readings)

### Validity

**Definition**

- **Meaning**: Whether a tool and method really does what it claims to do
- **In Research**: Whether a research tool and method actually measures what it claims to measure
- **Alternative Definition**: Validity of research tool and method accurately reflects the social reality which it claims to reflect

**Examples**

- **Absurd Example**: Using thermometer in mouth and claiming reading reflects person's weight - not valid measure of weight
- **Sociology Test Example**: Using sociology test scores to reflect IQ/intelligence of students - not valid measure of intelligence
- **IQ Tests Controversy**: Do IQ tests really capture intelligence of people?
  - **Issue**: Performance on IQ test may be affected by factors other than intelligence
  - **Factor**: Level of familiarity with test format
  - **Example**: White persons vs. Black persons in America - whites more familiar due to socio-cultural background
  - **Indian Context**: UPSC aspirants vs. someone from non-descript village in interior Jharkhand - UPSC aspirants more likely to score better due to familiarity, not necessarily higher intelligence

### Measures to Enhance Reliability and Validity

1. **Using Combination of Methods**: Using combination of research techniques and methods instead of relying on just one

2. **Cross-checking Results**: Getting results cross-checked by other researchers

3. **Precise Definitions**: Key terms should be defined with precision to avoid vagueness or ambiguity

4. **Careful Questionnaire Design**: If data collected using questionnaire, it has to be designed carefully
   
   - Poorly worded questions should be avoided

5. **Proper Note-taking**: If data collected using participant observation or field study, notes should be taken down very properly
   
   - Cannot rely on memory when staying 6-8 months in community
   - Note down each and everything in daily diary

6. **Avoid Misreporting**: Misreporting of responses must be avoided

7. **Proper Training**: Staff collecting data should be properly trained

8. **Transparent Reporting**: Research report should be candid with transparency, not hiding uncomfortable facts that contradict viewpoint

## DATA AND INFORMATION (177:51)

### Distinction Between Terms

- **Common Usage**: Terms data and information are often used interchangeably
- **Relationship**: They are closely related but not the same

### Data Characteristics

- **Composition**: Comprises of assorted facts
- **Nature**: Raw and unorganized
- **Limitation**: May be unrelated
- **Standalone Value**: Data on its own may not mean much
- **Independence**: Data is not dependent on information

### Information Characteristics

- **Definition**: Organization and interpretation of those facts
- **Function**: Puts facts and data in context
- **Nature**: Organized
- **Purpose**: Maps data and tells us how it all fits together
- **Dependency**: Information is derived from and therefore dependent on data

### Processing Relationship

- **Transformation**: Data becomes information when contextualized, organized, and interpreted
- **Utility**: In form of information, it is very useful input in decision-making
- **Actionability**: Information is actionable for decision-making, while data by itself may not be of much use

### DURKHEIM's Example

- **Data Collection**: Collected data regarding suicide from different official records
- **Processing**: When he classified and processed it, it became information
- **Raw Data**: Individual suicide records
- **Information**: "Suicide rate of men is more than that of women; of Protestants is more than that of Catholics," etc.

### Conclusion

- **Relationship**: Data and information are two sides of same coin
- **Integration**: They are intimately related and go together in research
- **Interdependence**: Both have their place and importance in research process
