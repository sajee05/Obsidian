# ROBERT KING MERTON: FUNCTIONALISM CRITIQUE AND CONTRIBUTIONS

## RECAP OF PARSONS (19:49)

### Quick Review of Social System Theory

- **Social System**: System driven by the maximization of gratification
- **Moving Equilibrium**: Dynamic equilibrium that occurs because of continuous exchange with the environment
- **AGIL Framework**: The four functional prerequisites
  1. **Adaptation**: Society needs to interact with the environment (performed by economic subsystem)
  2. **Goal Attainment**: Achievement of collective goals (performed by political subsystem)
  3. **Integration**: Mechanism for consensus building and resolution of conflicts (performed by judicial and legal subsystems)
  4. **Latency**: Pattern maintenance and transmission from one generation to another (performed by cultural institutions)

### Cybernetic Hierarchy of Control

- **Definition**: Exchange of needs and social actions between the four action systems
- **Order of Hierarchy**: Organismic → Personality → Social System → Cultural System

### Pattern Variables

- **Definition**: Sets of dichotomous choices actors must make
- **Five Pattern Variables**:
  1. **Ascription vs Achievement** (also known as Quality vs Performance)
  2. **Diffuse vs Specific**: Range of obligations
  3. **Particularism vs Universalism**: Relationship based on emotional connection vs universal set of principles
  4. **Affectivity vs Affective Neutrality**: Emotional involvement vs neutral approach
  5. **Self vs Collectivity**: Whose interests to prioritize

## MERTON'S CRITIQUE OF CLASSICAL FUNCTIONALISM (43:21)

### Context of Criticism

- **Classical Functionalism**: What we have studied till now as represented in DURKHEIM or PARSONS
- **Specific Target**: MERTON was particularly critical of MALINOWSKI and A.R. RADCLIFFE BROWN
- **Purpose**: To make functionalism more robust by removing unnecessary assumptions

### The Three Problematic Assumptions

#### 1. Postulate of Universal Functionalism (48:49)

**Classical Functionalism Assumes:**

- All existing social and cultural forms are functional for the whole society
- Everything that exists has functions or positive consequences for the entire society

**MERTON's Corrective:**

- Any existing social and cultural forms may be:
  - **Functional**: Having positive consequences for some groups
  - **Dysfunctional**: Having negative consequences for some groups  
  - **Non-functional**: Having no consequences for some groups

**Examples:**

- **Caste System**: Functional for higher castes, dysfunctional for lower castes
- **Poverty**: Functional for the rich (cheap labor), dysfunctional for the poor

#### 2. Postulate of Functional Unity (57:46)

**Classical Functionalism Assumes:**

- Various social institutions are interconnected and interdependent
- Consequently, a change in one institution will lead to changes in the other institutions as well

**MERTON's Response:**

- Such functional unity may exist in traditional society
- But in modern society characterized by structural differentiation, this assumption may not hold
- Different social institutions in modern societies may operate with a fair degree of autonomy

**Explanation of Structural Differentiation:**

- **Traditional Society**: One person/institution performs multiple roles (father = teacher = boss = landlord)
- **Modern Society**: Specialized institutions perform specific roles (separate teacher, boss, landlord)

#### 3. Postulate of Indispensability (1:14:11)

**Classical Functionalism Assumes:**

- Certain social institutions which are performing some very vital functions are indispensable for the society

**MERTON's Corrective:**

- Some other alternatives may be able to fulfill the same functions
- There may be functional alternatives for the performance of the same function

**Example - Family Institution:**

- Society needs reproduction and socialization mechanisms
- Family performs these functions
- But this doesn't make family indispensable - other arrangements could theoretically perform same functions

## MANIFEST AND LATENT FUNCTIONS (1:28:57)

### Basic Definitions

- **Manifest Functions**: Those positive consequences that are intended and recognized by the participants involved
- **Latent Functions**: Those positive consequences that are neither intended nor recognized by the participants
- **Manifest Dysfunctions**: Those negative consequences which are recognized by the participants involved  
- **Latent Dysfunctions**: Those negative consequences that are not recognized by the participants

### Key Characteristics

- **Manifest Functions**: Subjective dispositions of the participants
- **Latent Functions**: Objective consequences captured by the researchers/sociologists

### Classic Example: HOPI INDIAN Rain Dance

| Function Type         | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manifest Function** | Pleasing the rain gods and the occurrence of rain                                              |
| **Latent Function**   | Reinforces group solidarity, produces collective effervescence, binds individuals to the group |

### Additional Categories

- **Manifest and Latent Dysfunctions**: Negative consequences (intended/recognized vs unintended/unrecognized)
- **Unanticipated Consequences**: Broader term including both latent functions and latent dysfunctions

## SIGNIFICANCE OF MANIFEST AND LATENT FUNCTIONS (1:41:06)

### 1. Deeper Understanding of Social Life

- These concepts enable sociologists to have a deeper understanding of social life way beyond the perceptions of ordinary men
- Ordinary men rely upon common sense and everyday experience to understand various aspects of society
- These concepts greatly expand our knowledge about the working of the society

### 2. Moving Beyond Ethnocentric Biases

- These concepts enable sociologists to move beyond their own ethnocentric biases
- Particularly while studying other societies and cultures
- **Ethnocentric Bias**: Tendency to regard our own culture/lifestyle as superior to others

### 3. New Areas of Inquiry

- Social phenomena which may otherwise appear "irrational" starts making more sense when we begin to search for its latent functions
- New areas of inquiry may emerge
- Instead of dismissing some social phenomena as a social artifact, the researcher may now investigate whether this phenomena performs some important latent functions

### 4. Altering Notions of Morality

- These concepts of manifest and latent functions have the potential to alter our notions of morality
- What may be regarded as highly immoral and therefore undesirable for the society may be found to be performing several latent functions

**Example - Prostitution:**

- Generally condemned as immoral
- Potential latent functions:
  - May lead to fewer rapes (channeling sexual frustration)
  - Provides economic support for families
  - Stabilizes marriages (alternative to extramarital affairs)
  - Contributes to economy (sex tourism)

### Practical Example: India-Pakistan Cricket Match

| Function Type             | Examples                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manifest Functions**    | Entertainment                                                                           |
| **Latent Functions**      | Collective effervescence, solidarity, patriotism, unity across caste/class/gender lines |
| **Manifest Dysfunctions** | Communal riots, hooliganism, destruction of public property, wastage of man-hours       |
| **Latent Dysfunctions**   | Fosters enmity between nations, pressure on players, other sports get less attention    |

### Criticisms and Limitations

1. **Moral Relativism**: Can be used to justify any perverse acts by finding latent functions
2. **Subjectivity**: Not truly objective - what's latent for one may be manifest for another researcher
3. **Causal Links**: Difficult to establish definitive causal relationships
4. **Limited Novelty**: Critics argue MERTON only provided new terminology for concepts already present in functional sociology

## REFERENCE GROUPS (2:25:23)

### Basic Group Theory Context

- Human beings live in groups
- These groups greatly affect our behavior
- Groups have different expectations from different members
- Individual members try to live up to those expectations to seek validation

### Definition and Origin

- **Term Coined By**: HERBERT HYMAN
- **Further Elaborated By**: MUZAFFER SHARIF and ROBERT K. MERTON

**Reference Group Definition:**

- Any social group that the individual uses for shaping and evaluating his own feelings, actions and attitudes
- Any social group that one uses as a standard or as a frame of reference to shape one's own behavior, actions and achievements is a reference group

### How Reference Groups Work

- Human beings always live in groups
- The groups to which we belong (known as membership groups) affect our conduct greatly
- Groups expect something from individual members
- The individual members act accordingly because they seek the group's approval
- Therefore, the group's members evaluate their conduct with reference to the norms and values of the group
- Thus the groups to which we belong (membership groups) serve as reference groups

### Non-Membership Reference Groups

- Many times several social groups of which one is not a member (non-membership groups) may also greatly affect the individual's behavior
- In other words, non-membership groups may also serve as a reference group

## ANTICIPATORY SOCIALIZATION (2:42:27)

### Definition

- It refers to the process of preparing oneself for entry into a non-membership reference group by adopting its norms, values and lifestyle

### Example

- For civil services aspirants, selected IAS officers are a reference group
- Aspirants model their conduct like selected officers (wake up at 5 AM, do pranayam, work hard)
- In anticipation of joining that group, they socialize/learn their norms, values, expectations, and lifestyle

| Concept                        | Definition                                     | Example                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Membership Groups**          | Groups to which we belong                      | Family, peer group, this class            |
| **Non-membership Groups**      | Groups to which we do not belong               | IAS officers (for aspirants)              |
| **Reference Groups**           | Groups used as frame of reference for behavior | Both membership and non-membership groups |
| **Anticipatory Socialization** | Preparing for entry into non-membership group  | Aspirants adopting IAS officer lifestyle  |
