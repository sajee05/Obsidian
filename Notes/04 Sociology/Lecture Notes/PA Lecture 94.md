# Globalization and Pandemic: Sociological Perspectives

## Introduction and Recap of Globalization (14:26)

- **Quick recap**: We had begun discussing globalization and its impact on collective life's various dimensions
- **Definition of Globalization**: Globalization refers to free flow of capital, free trade, and open markets across the globe
- Production factors of production freely flow from one region to another

### Global Village Concept

- **MARSHALL MCLUHAN** gave the concept of global village
- Under this concept, he says that the world has united because of share of information and knowledge
- It has become more integrated
- It has been referred to as like a village where everybody is close net and it's like a close net community with regular interaction between the members

### Need for Global Sociology

- **Why do we need global sociology?**: Because any person is affected by events and process that is happening everywhere
- We are more interconnected than ever before

## Impact of Globalization on Various Aspects of Life (19:02)

### Impact on Family and Kinship

- **JP SINGH's observations**:
  - Globalization has affected our family and kinship a lot
  - Due to globalization, the meeting process have changed
  - Extended kin have become less relevant
  - The authority and power have shifted from the elders to the younger earning members of the family
  - Power has shifted from the elderly to young adult male earning members of the family

### Impact on Stratification System

- Poverty cases have declined
- The middle class has exploded
- **Scholars who talked about middle class expansion**:
  - LEELA FERNANDES
  - PAVAN VARMA
  - GURUCHARAN DAS
  - **R. VAIDYANATHAN** - also wrote "India's New Capitalist" with DAMODARAN
- The social base of capitalist class has widened
- This process is called **Westernization**

### Impact on Language

- **CHANDRABHAN PRASAD's argument**:
  
  - Introduction of English concept of English goddess worship
  - Worshipping English as a goddess
  - Particularly backward sections and dalits should worship English goddess
  - Because it provides employment options for them
  - It helps them to break free from the shackles of caste
  - Provides them employment opportunities in the market economy

- **RITA KOTHARI and RUUP SNELL** in their book "Chutnifying English":
  
  - Talk about hybridization of the English language
  - Hindi plus English becomes Hinglish
  - Punjabi plus English and Bengali plus English
  - This affects our lives because local languages are becoming dying and neither proper English has been speaking and neither the Hindi and other languages

### Political Implications

- **YOGENDRA YADAV** gave the concept of political administrative corruption
- Globalization has led to rise in political administrative corruption
- It gives them more opportunity to corrupt

## Historicity of Globalization Process (24:56)

### When Did Globalization Begin?

- Since early 1990s when the economy was opened up
- Economic reforms were initiated by the NARSIMHA RAO MANMOHAN SINGH government
- Due to an imminent foreign reserves crisis
- This was all in the context of the aftermath of the disintegration of USSR
- Our economy was increasingly integrated in the global economy

### T.K. OOMMEN's Perspective

- **T.K. OOMMEN** says globalization is a much older process - several centuries old process
- It did not begin in the 1990s
- The beginnings of globalization can be traced to the 16th century
- Globalization since then has occurred in phases

### Three Phases of Globalization

#### First Phase (16th Century to End of Second World War)

- From the 16th century till the end of the Second World War
- **Main agent**: European colonialism was the primary vehicle of globalization
- Colonial Europe became the chief agent of globalization
- As they established colonies in different parts of the world, European cultural elements, trade ties, political ties, all of these deepened across the globe
- Examples from India:
  - English language came during colonial rule
  - Western ways of living (eating with spoon and fork)
  - Cultural elements like language, food habits, dressing were spread to different parts of the globe by the European colonizers

#### Second Phase (Cold War Period)

- From end of Second World War to fall of USSR (four-five decades period)
- **Two main agents**: Capitalist United States of America and Socialist USSR
- The two global superpowers became the two principal agents of globalization
- They spread their respective ideologies, their respective politico-economic systems to various parts of the globe

#### Third Phase (Present Phase)

- After the demise of Soviet Russia from 1990s
- **Sole agent**: America as the sole global superpower
- What we typically regard as the period of globalization is only the latest phase of globalization
- Globalization began much earlier

### AMARTYA SEN's View

- **AMARTYA SEN** says globalization is a new term for a very old process
- It has been going on since millennia
- During even the period of ancient history there were extensive trade and commercial ties between the Indus Valley Civilizational cities and various other parts of the world
- There were political and diplomatic ties
- People from different regions across the globe would send their representatives, missionaries etc. to different parts of the world
- The spread of religion - whether Buddhism which emanated from India and spread to various countries South East Asia, Sri Lanka (Ashoka sent his son Mahindra)
- Think of the ancient Silk Route which connected so many regions
- Traders would travel long distances, religious missionaries, whether the spread of Hinduism, Islam, Christianity
- These have been very old processes - political expansion, trade ties, diplomatic relations

### Indian Philosophy and Globalization

- Indian philosophy also believes in **VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBAKAM** (The world is one family)
- As the G20 tagline goes: Vasudha referring to the earth, kutumb meaning family
- So the whole earth is one family
- Indian culture has always been very wary of the frog in the well mentality (KOOP MANDOOK)
- Koop means well, mandook refers to frog
- Indian culture has been very conscious against remaining restricted, restricting one's thoughts, one's world view to only one's immediate surroundings
- Don't become a frog in the well. There is a big wide world out there. Go and explore it

## Arguments For and Against Globalization (35:31)

### Arguments in Favor of Globalization

- **Technology transfer benefits**: Medical technology during COVID, diplomatic technology
- **Economic benefits**: 
  - Income to India saved us
  - Had it not been for the World Bank and IMF rescuing the Indian economy, we would have sunk
  - They were our knights in shining armor, we were the damsels in distress
- **Economic specialization**: Certain countries, certain regions specialize in the production of certain goods, complementarities being attended and those synergies being harnessed at a global scale
- **Improved standard of living**: Even the poorest have mobile phones, WhatsApp which is really empowering
- **Employment opportunities**: Indians are employed internationally
- Globalization has come to be regarded as a near inevitable process

### Criticisms of Globalization

#### 1. Coca-Colonization

- **Meaning**: American culture is being imposed across the globe
- It is threatening and wiping out cultural diversity
- **COCA-COLA** is symbolic of America's cultural power
- Coca-Cola has replaced coconut water in Kerala and lassi in Punjab
- Previously, if a guest would visit our house:
  - If I were a Malayali, I would give them coconut water
  - If I were a Punjabi, I would give them lassi
- Now we give Coca-Cola across the globe
- Coca-Cola company claims that Coca-Cola is the second most recognized understood word across cultures globally
- This term indicates the wider process of wiping out cultural diversity
- We have all become cheap Americans in our accents, in our clothing, in our food habits, in the entertainment that we consume
- Examples of American format adoptions:
  - "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" became "Kaun Banega Crorepati?"
  - "Big Brother" became "Big Boss"
  - "America's Got Talent" became "India's Got Talent"
  - "Master Chef Australia" became "Master Chef India"
  - "Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?" became similar format in India

#### 2. Disruption of Traditional Social Structures and Identities

- Joint family, village community, tribal identity, caste as a community, religious identity
- These traditional structures and identities provide a sense of belonging and stability
- All of which is being disturbed now
- That is why the world seems in a continuous state of flux
- Nothing seems permanent
- This produces social anxiety and tension

#### 3. One-Way Process

- Largely Western culture is being imposed on non-Western peoples
- It's not a two-way traffic that non-Western cultures are also equally affecting Western civilization
- This is not only detrimental for the non-Western cultures but also the Western civilization
- Had it been a more equitable, multidirectional flow, the Western societies could have also benefited from whatever is worthy of adoption from the non-Western cultures
- Examples of limited reverse flow: Yoga, Bollywood movies have found global audience but to a much lesser extent

#### 4. Bio-piracy and Traditional Knowledge

- **VANDANA SHIVA** pointed out that the process of globalization entails profit-seeking multinational corporations patenting the traditional knowledge of the people
- Properties of turmeric and neem which our mothers, grandmothers, great-grandmothers were passing down since generations for free are now sought to be sold for profit

#### 5. Environmental Destruction

- **VANDANA SHIVA** says the process of globalization is environmentally destructive
- It represents the spread of patriarchal capitalism
- Women's bodies are commodified
- They are sold as items of commerce whether in pornography, advertising, fashion

#### 6. Neo-Imperialism

- The first world countries are ensuring their continued dominance
- The Western countries are ensuring their continued dominance after the formal end of colonialism
- By other means through the global financial architecture (World Bank, IMF), through technological dependence, through soft power
- America's particularly soft power is very appealing, very seductive
- Somewhere we all want to become American
- Examples: People wear "I Love New York" but you won't find "I Love Ghatkoper"
- We don't have a sense of attachment, belonging, pride to our own cultural identity

#### 7. Ruthless Promotion of Free Market Mechanism

- Who benefits from the process of globalization? Those who have money
- Even as a middle-class consumer, I benefit because I have money so I can buy from a greater wider choice of products
- But those who do not have the capacity, those who don't have purchasing power, don't have the capacity to participate in the market mechanism, their interests are not taken care of by globalization
- In fact, it worsens the problems of the marginalized sections of the society
- Not just it turns a blind eye to their problems, it worsens them
- Examples: Tribals whose lands are snatched away, small farmers who have increasing dependency on MNC produced seeds and fertilizers, urban poor

### Alternative Approaches

- Critics like SHIVA vouch for and demand what they call **alter-globalization**
- Meaning an alternative pattern of globalization
- **Globalization with a human face**
- Globalization should not be just economic growth and numbers
- The process should be made more human, more considerate particularly for the vulnerable and the marginalized - the tribals, the poor, the landless
- Trade should not only be free but also fair
- Free trade should not mean unequal terms of trade imposed by the Western nations on the developing world

#### 8. New Social Problems on Global Scale

- International human trafficking
- International drug trade
- Ozone depletion, climate change
- Dark net
- The pandemic

## Cultural Homogenization vs. Other Processes (59:51)

### Will Globalization Result in Cultural Homogenization?

- **Assessment of the threat**: Whether globalization is likely to result in cultural homogenization
- What we see: We are becoming all quite American-type, losing our distinctive culture, our identity

### OOMMEN's Analysis: Four Simultaneous Processes

#### 1. Homogenization

- Western cultural elements are being adopted at a fast pace in many parts of the world
- Examples: Adoption of blue jeans, Coca-Cola, fast food, cakes
- Birthday cake cutting ceremony has replaced traditional sweets like kheer and halwa

#### 2. Traditionalization

- People reinvigorating their traditional identities
- People emphasizing, highlighting, sticking to their traditional identities
- As a reaction against the homogenizing tendency of globalization
- Example: Religious revivalism - many young Muslims are refusing American-style freedom, Muslim women choosing to retain the hijab, Muslim men asserting their right to wear the Islamic dress, the topi

#### 3. Pluralization

- Global and local cultural elements coexisting side by side
- Example: You started eating burgers, pizzas, momos - have you stopped eating dal, chawal, roti, aloo, khichdi and Indian foods? No
- For the most part we are still consuming Indian cuisine, regional food items, local items
- We only added on Western cultural elements to an already full plate
- We wear jeans but when we are cool youth, we wear what? Jeans with kurta

#### 4. Localization (Glocal)

- Global plus local = Glocal
- When global cultural elements are adapted to the local culture
- Global cultural elements are not replacing local cultural elements
- Instead they themselves are taking up a local form which is more palatable, more acceptable to the local people
- Examples:
  - McDonald's serving aloo tikki burger in India keeping local sensitivities in mind
  - Gobi Manchurian, paneer pizza, paneer momos, chicken Manchurian - we have Indianized everything as per our own taste and preferences
  - Democracy in India: We took democracy but added caste, religion, ethnicity into it
  - Democracy's functioning in India is rooted in structures of caste, ethnicity, and religion

### OOMMEN's Conclusion

- **Highly unlikely** that globalization will result in cultural homogenization
- **Mere accessibility does not mean acceptability**: We can see and access Western culture, but that doesn't mean we will adopt it
- Example of Christianity in India:
  - Christianity has arrived long back, there was a very long period of rule by Europeans who professed Christianity
  - Christian missionaries were working diligently, they also did a lot to discredit the native culture
  - Yet Christianity was not accepted by the people at large
  - Even after so many years of colonization then followed by Westernization in independent India, you hardly have 2-3% Christian population in India

## GANDHI's Philosophy on Cultural Exchange (80:38)

### GANDHI's Window Metaphor

- **GANDHI** said: "I will keep the windows of my house open"
- "I will allow the winds from all directions to blow into my house"
- "I am willing to let winds from all directions to blow into my house"
- "But I refuse to be blown off my feet"
- Meaning: I am willing to let various cultural influences visit my home and demonstrate what they have before me
- But I refuse to let go of my own cultural roots

### GANDHI's Practice

- GANDHI was practicing this philosophy: "My life is my message"
- GANDHI was very well traveled, had international exposure during his early days
- He was very Westernized through his education, upbringing and everything
- If you would have seen that photo of a young GANDHI in Western wear
- But after having traversed the world, after having thoroughly read portions of the Bible, portions of the Quran, various other texts, he remained a committed desi
- He remained a committed Sanatani
- This is not about unnecessarily criticizing other cultures or finding faults in them
- Whatever good qualities they have, I am open to them
- But I will not become something which I am not

## The Pandemic: A Sociological Analysis (98:41)

### Personal Experiences and Impact

- **Collective traumatic experience**: One of the most horrible times of our lives
- **Widespread effects**:
  - College life's two years went at home
  - Many had COVID twice, some were admitted to ICU
  - Fear of death was very real
  - People becoming more religious, remembering God
  - Rising domestic tensions and divorces
  - Students working as volunteers arranging oxygen cylinders and hospital beds
  - Pathetic health care infrastructure
  - Cremation grounds running out of space
  - Families spending more time together due to lockdowns
  - Isolation within families when members were infected

### JEFFREY ALEXANDER's Theory

- **JEFFREY ALEXANDER** says that the Corona virus brought science to the center of public discourse
- Science no more remained the area of interest of scientists and governments only
- Society at large, ordinary people, everybody became increasingly interested in science
- Scientists, particularly doctors or medical science people, were treated as the new heroes of the society
- They were called "Corona Warriors" by Modi ji
- They started occupying leadership positions in the society instead of being on the fringes as consultants and experts providing inputs

### The Pandemic as More Than Medical Crisis

- The pandemic is not only a bio-medical emergency
- It's also a social and political crisis
- Why did everybody become interested in science? Because everyone and anyone could be affected by the virus
- Whether I am rich or poor, old, young, girl, boy, American, Chinese, Indian - the virus could affect me
- **In that sense, the virus was a great equalizer**

### Global Nature of the Pandemic

- The pandemic affected every human being on the planet, including those who are not afflicted by the virus but their lives were greatly affected by the pandemic
- Every human being was affected by the Corona pandemic
- **The pandemic was a truly global phenomena** affecting each and every person on this earth
- It is the most concrete proof that the world has indeed become a global village
- Like infectious diseases spread in villages, now it was spreading across the world

### Pandemic and De-globalization

- Interestingly, the pandemic also contributed towards de-globalization
- It revealed the global character of our society, the interconnected nature of our world, but also contributed towards de-globalization
- One of the first steps of countries across the globe was to ban international flights
- You stop the influx of migrants
- Then you saw various countries trying to rescue their own countrymen
- You saw vaccine nationalism - Indian vaccines, who has the first right over them? Indian people
- Why should these vaccines be given to other countries when all Indians have not yet been vaccinated?

### Need for International Collaboration

- The pandemic also highlighted the need for international collaboration between governments, health professionals, medical scientists, social scientists across the globe

## PHIL STRONG's Framework for Pandemic Analysis (129:32)

### Three Stages of Social Pandemic

#### Stage 1: Fear

- People start fearing loss of life, loss of livelihood, loss of mobility, health
- The novelty of the disease creates fear
- Since it's a new kind of disease and virus which afflicts the society, people are very fearful regarding how it is transmitted
- What are its long-term consequences on one's health and well-being?
- People develop a fear of ordinary objects - door knobs become scary, people try to open doors with toes
- The innocence of children - children are considered as the epitome of innocence but during such pandemics they seem as carriers of death
- We become fearful of children, we become fearful of our closest kith and kin
- Everything becomes a source of fear
- **The mask** literally became the symbol of this fear
- Human breath was a source of fear

#### Stage 2: Explanation

- People seek explanations, they want to make sense of what is happening

- Explanations come in varied forms:
  
  **Scientific explanations**: A lot of credence is attributed to scientists, health practitioners, data scientists
  
  **Religious explanations**: The epidemic is an outcome of divine retribution, that the world has become sinful
  
  **Conspiracy theories**: These are typically far-fetched explanations which attribute motives and conspiracy
  
  - Among Muslims in some Muslim countries: It's a Jewish conspiracy to wipe out Muslims
  - In India: It came to be regarded as Corona Jihad by Muslims trying to corrupt the Hindus

#### Stage 3: Action

- People feel something must be done in order to stop the problem, deal with the problem, prevent the spread of the epidemic
- Some steps must be taken
- Typically such steps are taken by governments
- Government wants to be seen to be doing something
- Nobody knew what to do - whether WHO or national governments
- Examples of actions:
  - Restrictions placed on businesses
  - Lockdowns imposed nationally
  - Schools were shut
  - Temples and places of worship were shut
  - All economic activity was suspended
  - International flights were stopped
  - Efforts were made to develop vaccines
  - Social distancing norms were laid down

## Risk Society Concept (141:05)

### BECK and GIDDENS' Risk Society Theory

- **Contemporary society is a risk society**
- People are very concerned about identifying and mitigating risk
- People greatly want to secure their future

### Why is Present Society Called Risk Society?

- There have always been risks associated with human living - risk of death, disease, crop failure throughout human history
- But in contemporary times, the frequency and the number of risks have greatly increased
- Particularly there are several **manufactured risks** that afflict and affect the life of man today
- **Manufactured risks**: Risks that have occurred due to human activity
  - Risk of nuclear accidents
  - Risk of road accidents
  - Industrial accidents
- This is why the entire insurance industry has arisen to mitigate risk

### Unequal Distribution of Risk

- Just like wealth, risk is also unequally distributed in the society
- But the two are not necessarily overlapping - it's not that wealthy people are less at risk
- Examples from pandemic:
  - Who was at higher risk of death due to the disease? City dwellers or villagers? **City dwellers**
  - Which age bracket was more at risk? **The elderly**
  - Children were pretty immune and less prone to succumbing to the pandemic and virus

### Events Like Pandemic Make People More Risk Conscious

- Events like the pandemic make people more risk conscious

## COVID-19 Specific Impacts on India (148:23)

### Economic and Social Impact

- **AMARTYA SEN and ABHIJIT BANERJEE** wrote that the pandemic pushed millions of Indians into poverty and hunger
- Due to the sudden lockdown, there was large-scale loss of livelihood
- They express an apprehension that people may disobey future lockdowns which will make it difficult to contain any future pandemics

### Gendered Effects of Work from Home

- **ASHWINI DESHPANDE** says the pandemic popularized the concept of work from home
- But the effect of work from home is gendered
- Many people lost jobs during the pandemic
- Women were disproportionately affected by job losses
- Dalits suffered more than upper castes
- Villagers suffered more than city dwellers

### Comparative Mortality Analysis

- **DEEPANKAR GUPTA** says we got off cheap during the current pandemic
- In the last pandemic (Spanish Flu in 1918), globally 15 to 20 million lives were lost
- Compare to that, till now we have lost around 7 lakh lives (when Gupta was writing, there were around 10 lakh deaths)
- So much fewer lives have been lost in the Corona pandemic than earlier ones
- But governments are very responsive, they are very quick to respond
- Look at India - this news just about came during March 2020, and by end of March the government imposed national lockdown
- Modi ji came on our TV screens and announced that only for 10-15 days you just have to stay indoors
- Nobody thought that people as Indians would obey, but the streets were empty

### Why Such Quick Response?

- More than health infrastructure or political system, it's democracy
- Democracy has become the prevalent political system across the globe, the most widely prevalent
- **In a democracy, every life matters**

### Health as Public Issue

- **GUPTA** sees health care has never received public attention, it has never been a political issue
- But the pandemic put the spotlight on the health care infrastructure of the country
- He also sees the pandemic provides an opportunity to put in effect a national ban on spitting
- Wearing of masks - now masks serve as a spit inhibitor
- You can't spit with the mask on
- So possibly we can use this opportunity provided by the pandemic to impose a ban on spitting in public spaces

### Educational Fantasy

- **KRISHNA KUMAR** is an educationist, he was the head of NCERT
- He says during the pandemic, educationists, policy makers, administrators developed the new fantasy
- That we will collectively shift from classroom-based education to online education
- But it was just that - a fantasy
- Why was it a fantasy? In a society, in a country where a good number of children flock to schools for mid-day meals, where there is a very real and wide digital divide, to imagine that there will be a seamless large-scale transition to online education is a stretch, is far-fetched
- Simply there is widespread poverty and hunger
- One of the things that attracts children to schools is food - mid-day meals
- There are grave inequalities in terms of mobile ownership, internet access, digital infrastructure
- Rural-urban also gender-based disparities
