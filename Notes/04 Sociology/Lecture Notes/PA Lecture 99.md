## SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES (136:26)

- **PRATAP BHANU MEHTA**: Points out that higher education ignores soft skills
- **Infantilization**: Higher education system infantilizes adults - treats 18-20 year old students like children

### Commercialization of Higher Education

#### Benefits of Commercialization

- **Competition**: Infuses healthy competition in education sphere, improving quality
- **Industry Linkage**: Better linked to needs of industry due to market pressure
- **Responsiveness**: More adaptive to technological and market changes
- **Funding**: Infuses much needed funding in higher education

#### Criticisms of Commercialization

- **Sacred Relationship**: Teacher-student relationship is qualitatively different and sacred
- **Inequality**: Only caters to those who have capacity to pay, worsens existing inequalities
- **Social Justice**: Will not factor in need for social justice like public education does
- **State Responsibility**: May absolve state of its responsibility to provide quality education to all

## SYSTEMIC ISSUES IN EDUCATION (159:09)

### Education Based on Fear

- **KRISHNA KUMAR**: States that education system largely based on fear of failure
- **Negative Approach**: All stakeholders (students, teachers, parents, administration) obsessed with preventing failure
- **Excellence vs Fear**: Cannot produce excellence based on fear instead of encouraging pursuit of excellence

### Rote Learning Culture

- **Historical Roots**: SAURABH YOGENDRA argues this stems from Brahmanical culture of mindless recitation of Sanskrit mantras
- **Oral Transmission**: Brahmanical mode of education emphasized rote learning through generations
- **Current Manifestation**: Students memorize multiplication tables, periodic tables, mathematical formulas without understanding

## GANDHI'S EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY: NAI TALEEM (164:16)

### Core Principles

- **NAI TALEEM**: New education philosophy developed by Gandhi
- **Handicraft-Based Education**: Lot of emphasis on handicraft-based learning

### Benefits of Handicraft Education

#### Financial Independence

- **Self-Sustaining Schools**: Schools can produce handicrafts, sell them, and become financially independent
- **Autonomy**: Financial independence means autonomy in teaching matters, freedom from bureaucratic control
- **Decentralization**: Teachers should have flexibility to decide how and what to teach

#### Social Transformation

- **Dignity of Labor**: If students of all castes evaluated on handicraft skills, it will inculcate sense of dignity of labor
- **Caste Consciousness**: Since handicrafts traditionally associated with lower castes, this can reduce caste-based discrimination
- **Equal Evaluation**: All students regardless of caste background evaluated on same practical skills

### Opposition to English Medium

- **Natural Extension**: School should be natural extension of home environment
- **Language Disconnect**: Introduction of English breaks natural linkage between home and school
- **Comprehension Issues**: Capacity to comprehend significantly diminishes when taught in foreign language
- **Time Efficiency**: What we teach in 11-12 years in English can be done in 6-7 years in mother tongue
- **Cost Factor**: Education in English unnecessarily expensive due to scarcity of English-fluent teachers
- **Social Status**: English has acquired very high social status, considered substitute for domain knowledge
- **National Character**: Using English has made us "a nation of imitators" - cannot achieve greatness by imitation
