# KARL MARX: CLASS STRUGGLE AND CAPITALISM

## MODE OF PRODUCTION (15:27)

- **Mode of production**: The manner in which the production and distribution of goods in a society is organized
- Every mode of production is characterized by two elements:
  1. **Factors of production** (forces of production)
  2. **Relations of production**

### Factors of Production vs Means of Production

- **Factors of production**: All the inputs in the process of production such as land, labor, etc.
- **Means of production**: All the factors of production excluding labor power
- **Relations of production**: The social relations that a man enters with another man in order to carry out the work
  - Examples: worker-worker relationship, worker-capitalist relationship

### Infrastructure vs Superstructure

- **Infrastructure/Base**: The economy - the economic foundation of society
- **Superstructure**: Cultural institutions involved in the process of production (except economy)
- **Relationship between infrastructure and superstructure**:
  1. The base shapes the superstructure - what kind of family etc. we have is dependent on the nature of the economy
  2. The superstructure legitimizes the inequalities in the base - religion etc. justify, legitimize and thereby help to perpetuate the prevailing inequalities in the society

### Different Modes of Production

The historical progression according to MARX:

1. Ancient slave society
2. Feudal society  
3. Capitalist society
4. Communist society

## FEATURES OF CAPITALIST MODE OF PRODUCTION (22:41)

### Key Characteristics

- **Labor is formally free**: Workers are not bound by feudal ties
- **Profit maximization**: The driving goal of production
- **Private ownership**: Means of production owned privately by the capitalist class
- **Two main classes**: 
  - **Bourgeoisie** (capitalist class)
  - **Proletariat** (working class)
- **Market-centric economy**: All production and inputs are sourced from the market
- **Commodification**: Everything has a monetary value assigned to it
- **Production for sale**: All output is meant to be sold in the market
- **Surplus appropriation**: Surplus value of labor is appropriated by the capitalist in the form of profit

### Alienation in Capitalism (25:51)

- **Alienation**: The disconnection of workers from various aspects of their labor
- **Four dimensions of alienation**:
  1. Alienation from the product of labor
  2. Alienation from the process of production
  3. Alienation from self
  4. Alienation from fellow workers and wider society

## CLASS STRUGGLE (28:54)

### Fundamental Principle

> "The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle" - KARL MARX

- **Meaning**: All societal transformations throughout history have been the result of struggles between opposing classes
- Humanity has passed through various phases where one type of society has been replaced by another through class struggle

### Nature of Class Struggle

- In every class society, there are **two antagonistic classes** whose interests are opposing
- **Halves and have-nots** exist in constant tension
- Examples:
  - Slave society: Masters vs Slaves
  - Feudal society: Lords vs Serfs
  - Capitalist society: Bourgeoisie vs Proletariat

### Class Conflict Characteristics

- Sometimes **overt** (out in the open, visible)
- Sometimes **covert** (hidden)
- Always present in all historical epochs and hitherto existing societies

## TRANSITION FROM FEUDALISM TO CAPITALISM (33:15)

### Process of Economic System Change

- **New productive forces start developing within the womb of the old society**
- Capitalist technology and production system starts taking shape within the framework of a broadly feudal society
- The new productive forces continue to develop further within the old framework till as long as they can

### Historical Example: Mercantilism to Capitalism

#### Stage 1: Mercantilism

- Enterprising merchants engaged in long-distance trade
- Buying from local producers and selling at distant markets
- Arbitrage in the value of things at two different places

#### Stage 2: Proto-Capitalism

- Merchants supply raw materials to producers
- Pay per piece rates to craftsmen
- Gradual control over production process

#### Stage 3: Early Factory System

- Establishment of centralized production facilities
- Workers migrate from rural areas to factory centers
- Monthly wage system introduced

### Constraints on Development

- **Point of stagnation**: New productive forces cannot develop any further within the old framework
- **Old relations of production start serving as tethers** to the further development of new productive forces
- In feudal society: Obligatory economic and social ties between different categories of people prevented workers from freely moving to factories

## DECISIVE CLASS STRUGGLE (56:13)

### When Class Struggle Occurs

- **At the crucial juncture** when new productive forces cannot develop further within the old framework
- Old relations of production become impediments to progress
- **Members of a rising class challenge the dominance of the entrenched minority ruling class**

### Process of Transformation

- The rising class (early capitalists) mobilizes the have-nots (serfs)
- Overthrows the old system to replace it with a new mode of production
- Example: French Revolution - bourgeoisie challenged and overthrew the feudal system

## PROLETARIAT REVOLUTION AND CLASS POLARIZATION (60:08)

### Marx's Prediction

- **Proletariat revolution is inevitable** according to MARX
- This is not wishful thinking but a **scientific prediction**
- Certain aspects of modern industrial capitalism will ensure its downfall

### Why Capitalism Will Fall

#### 1. Inherent Instability (63:46)

- **Fundamental conflict of interest** between the two main classes (bourgeoisie and proletariat) which cannot be resolved
- **Class interests**:
  - Bourgeoisie: Profit maximization
  - Working class: Wage maximization
- As wages increase, they eat into profits; to increase profits, wages must be depressed

#### 2. Contradiction in Production and Ownership (65:47)

- **Social nature of production vs individual nature of ownership**
- Production requires many workers coordinating their efforts
- But ownership remains with individual capitalists
- Workers will eventually realize this contradiction

#### 3. Class Polarization Process (67:37)

- Certain social processes in capitalism will ensure **class polarization**
- Society will get divided into two clearly distinct, separate and opposed classes

### Processes Leading to Class Polarization

#### A. Deskilling and Homogenization (69:02)

- As technology improves, it will lead to **deskilling and consequent homogenization of the workforce**
- All jobs will become equally unskilled
- Workers will develop true class consciousness as distinctions disappear

#### B. Petit Bourgeoisie Decline (73:08)

- **Petit bourgeoisie will sink into the proletariat**
- Small businesses cannot withstand competition from big businesses
- Big corporations have advantages:
  - Economies of scale
  - Huge advertising budgets
  - Ability to artificially depress prices
- This removes the "cushioning effect" that petit bourgeoisie provided

#### C. Factory Concentration (81:13)

- More workers will get concentrated in larger factories
- This facilitates communication and brotherhood among workers

#### D. Pauperization (83:29)

- **Pauperization of the proletariat**: Working class becomes poorer relative to the capitalist class
- The gap between rich and poor widens even if absolute living standards improve

## FALSE vs TRUE CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS (87:00)

### False Class Consciousness

- **Workers are unaware of the reality of their own situation**
- They accept the dominance of the dominant class without protest
- Consider the prevailing system as just, fair and reasonable
- Unaware of their own exploitation and oppression

#### Causes of False Class Consciousness

- **Hold of ruling class ideology** on the minds of the working class
- Achieved through:
  - Mass media
  - Religion  
  - Language manipulation
  - Advertising

#### Examples of Ideological Manipulation

- **Freedom rhetoric**: Using concepts like "free market" and "freedom" to disguise wage slavery
- **Advertising**: Generates false needs and associates heartless corporates with cherished human emotions

### Class in Itself vs Class for Itself

#### Class in Itself (95:35)

- Workers who objectively belong to the same class (non-owners of means of production)
- But lack awareness that they are members of the same class
- Governed by false class consciousness
- Divided by artificial corporate hierarchies and skill distinctions

#### Class for Itself (99:13)

- **Workers transformed from class in itself to class for itself**
- **False class consciousness replaced by true class consciousness**
- Workers can see through ruling class ideology
- They realize:
  - All belong to the same class
  - Have same class interests
  - Are being exploited and oppressed
  - Need to identify the common class enemy (bourgeoisie)
- **Take collective class action** to overthrow the capitalist system

## DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT (114:07)

### Intervening Stage

- **Stage between capitalist society and communist society**
- Also referred to as **socialism**
- After the bloody proletariat revolution, some members of the proletariat seize control of:
  1. State apparatus
  2. Means of production
- Done **on behalf of the whole of the working class**

### Primary Tasks

- **Remove the last vestiges of capitalism**
- **Unravel the supporting superstructure** that accompanies the exploitative capitalist system
- Eliminate laws, religion, family systems, education systems that perpetuate inequality and exploitation
- Increase productivity through technological advancement

## COMMUNIST SOCIETY (122:23)

### Irony of Marx's Writings

- MARX is regarded as the high priest of communism
- But he wrote very little about the actual nature of communist society
- Most analysis focused on critiquing capitalist society
- Details about communist society are scattered and cursory

### Characteristics of Communist Society

#### Economic Structure

- **Egalitarian society** - classless social structure
- **Productive forces owned and controlled by the whole community**
- **No concept of private property** - notion actively abolished
- **Very advanced technology** - even more advanced than capitalism
- **Society of abundance**

#### Political Structure

- **Stateless society** - the state will wither away
- State's purpose (protecting class interests) becomes unnecessary in classless society
- **Moneyless society** - no concept of money
- **Religionless society** - no religion

#### Production and Distribution Principle

> "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" - KARL MARX

- People contribute based on their respective abilities
- Society meets the needs of all its members
- Contrast with capitalism: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution"

#### Social Life

- **No alienation in society**
- People not trapped in narrow occupational roles
- **No specialization or rigid division of labor**

> "The society will make it possible for me to hunt in the morning, to catch fish in the afternoon, to rear cattle in the evening and criticize after dinner without ever having to become a hunter, a fisherman, a shepherd or a critic" - KARL MARX

#### Nature of Work and Change

- People work for **innate satisfaction** rather than external rewards
- Man will see expression of his personality in the product of his labor
- **Unchanging society** - no more conflicts, contradictions, or class struggles
- **Final stage of human social evolution**

## DIALECTICAL LAWS IN OPERATION (145:21)

### Three Dialectical Laws Observed

1. **Unity and conflict of opposites**: Antagonistic classes (halves and have-nots) oppose in interest but come together to undertake production

2. **Transformation from quantitative to qualitative change**: Incremental changes in production system within old society eventually result in qualitative transformation of entire society

3. **Law of negation of negation**: Every stage is outcome of destruction of previous stage which itself destroyed the stage prior to it

## STUDENT PERSPECTIVES AND CRITIQUE (147:46)

### Criticisms Raised

- Communist society sounds "too good to be true"
- Human greed not adequately considered in analysis
- Man in communist society sounds robotic
- Difficult to implement in practice

### Support for Marx

- Marx as brilliant observer of social facts and struggles  
- Critique of capitalism remains relevant
- Shifted historical focus from elites to common people
- Highlighted exploitation that still holds relevance
- Won hearts of poor people by bringing reality to light
- His ideology instrumental in working class organization

### Contemporary Relevance

- Broad schema of class divide remains same
- Technology evolved but working class vs capitalist division persists
- Rights emphasized in liberal democracies favor rich more than addressing basic needs of masses
