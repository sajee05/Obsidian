# Sociology Lecture: Social Exclusion, Politics and Society

## SOCIAL EXCLUSION: CONCEPT AND DEFINITION (25:51)

### Review: Functions of Poverty

- **Poverty serves integral functions** in the operation of several industries including:
  - Dirty and menial jobs in hospitals and other industries
  - Creates a **reserve army of labor** for capitalists
  - According to MARXIST perspective: Poor are an important component of the reserve army of labor
- **Vicious circle theory**: Poor educational outcomes lead to poor income levels, low salaries, etc.

### Defining Social Exclusion

- **Social exclusion**: A process by which certain individuals and social groups are **denied full participation** in the life of a community
- When a certain section of society is deprived of certain **opportunities, resources, and rights**
- **Broader concept** than poverty - social exclusion may be on account of various factors other than poverty

### Social Exclusion vs Poverty

- **The poor are socially excluded** - deprived of opportunities, rights, and resources ordinarily available to other members of society
- **Social exclusion is a much broader concept** while the poor are among the socially excluded
- **Social exclusion implies** being excluded from society and being deprived of full participation in social life

| Aspect | Poverty                    | Social Exclusion                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope  | Economic deprivation       | Broader - multiple forms of exclusion             |
| Basis  | Lack of material resources | Various factors (caste, gender, disability, etc.) |
| Nature | Primarily economic         | Social, political, cultural exclusion             |

## CAUSES AND FACTORS OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION (36:00)

### Major Causative Factors

1. **Poverty**
   
   - Poor excluded from financial and banking systems
   - Historically excluded from insurance coverage and bank accounts
   - Exclusion from education system

2. **Ascriptive Identity**
   
   - **Caste**: Scheduled castes and lower castes excluded from full participation in Hindu society
   - Denied access to education, entry into temples, use of public wells
   - **Gender**: Women and girls excluded from education system, public sphere, certain sacred spaces
   - **Race**: Particularly in Western contexts

3. **Disability**
   
   - Public infrastructure, buildings, and open spaces are not disabled-friendly
   - Parks and public facilities designed for able-bodied individuals

4. **Unemployment**
   
   - Major causative factor particularly in the West
   - In Western societies, occupation is primary source of social identity
   - Being without work removes major source of social connections and embeddedness

5. **Homelessness**
   
   - Common issue in Western countries

6. **Sexual Orientation**
   
   - **LGBTQ+ community** suffers from social exclusion
   - May be denied job opportunities

7. **Migration**
   
   - Immigrants often unwelcome in many societies
   - Considered as trouble makers consuming society's resources undeservedly
   - Example: Wave of inward migration in Europe, Rohingyas and Bangladeshi Muslims in India

8. **Self-Exclusion**
   
   - Some categories voluntarily cut off from mainstream society
   - Start looking inward instead of integrating into wider society
   - **Examples**:
     - Poor blacks in American ghettos
     - Ghettoization of Muslims in Indian cities
     - Certain tribal communities maintaining distance from mainstream society

## TRANSGENDER SOCIAL EXCLUSION: A DETAILED ANALYSIS (49:50)

### Understanding Transgender Identity

- **Transgender**: Refers to persons whose gender does not match with the gender assigned to them at birth
- **Term includes**:
  - Trans men
  - Trans women  
  - Persons with intersex variations
  - Persons having socio-cultural identities like **HIJDA**, **ARAVANI**, **KINNAR**, **JOGTA**, etc.

### Historical Context in Indian Society

- **Ancient and medieval periods**: Transgenders enjoyed elevated social position
- Were respected and even worshiped
- **Tradition from Ramayana**: When Lord Rama went into forest exile, he asked all men and women to return, but transgenders waited for 14 years at forest entrance
- This led to tradition of **BADHAI** - transgender blessings considered very auspicious for marriages and birth of children
- **Medieval period**: Transgenders were integral part of Muslim kingdoms as bodyguards of queens due to their loyalty and strength

### Colonial Impact and Degradation

- **Position significantly declined during colonial period**
- Western gender binary was imposed on Indian people
- Legislative measures like **Section 377** criminalized alternative sexual behavior

### Contemporary Social Exclusion of Transgenders

#### Comprehensive Exclusion

- **Most comprehensive and total kind of social exclusion**
- Unlike other excluded communities, transgenders are **given up by their families**
- Suffer exclusion from every aspect of social life

#### Specific Areas of Exclusion

1. **Educational System**
   
   - Sidelined from education system
   - Rarely encounter transgenders in classrooms (unlike other marginalized groups)

2. **Economic Exclusion**
   
   - Pushed into occupations like **begging and sex work**
   - Do not typically inherit family property
   - With modernization, traditional **BADHAI** practice is declining

3. **Healthcare and Public Services**
   
   - Denied access to healthcare services
   - Face discrimination in public offices and by bureaucracy

4. **Violence and Sexual Abuse**
   
   - Victims of violence, particularly sexual violence
   - Occurs in prisons, police stations, railway platforms, public toilets, public transport, courts

5. **Media Portrayal**
   
   - Subject to widespread stereotyping in media
   - Often used for comic relief in mainstream cinema
   - Depicted in stereotypical ways as sexually provocative and aggressive

#### Scholarly Perspectives

- **GAIL RUBIN**: "Transgenders are amongst the most despised sexual minorities and lie at the bottom of the erotic pyramid"
- **RAJESH TALWAR** in "The Third Sex and Human Rights": Identified various socioeconomic problems faced by transgender community in India and South Asia
- **NALSA Judgment**: Highlighted that transgenders face discrimination in all spheres of social life

| Exclusion Type | Specific Examples                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

### Impact on Society as a Whole

3. **Economic Inefficiency and Lower Productivity**
   
   - Society suffers when less efficient members are chosen over more capable ones
   - If women excluded from public sphere and work, society loses potential economic contribution
   - **India's female labor force participation rate** significantly lower than male participation
   - Results in **lower economic growth** for the country

4. **Crime, Violence and Social Instability**
   
   - Can weaken **social solidarity**
   - Socially excluded will be less committed to society

5. **Social Movements**
   
   - **Feminist movement**: Seeks better integration of women in society
   - **Dalit movement**: To wash away historical stigma and ensure greater participation
   - **LGBTQ+ rights movement**: Demands equal treatment and opportunities

6. **Policy Measures and Court Judgments**
   
   - Laws against prevention of untouchability
   - **SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act**
   - **Prime Minister's 15-point program** for Muslim integration
   - **Sabarimala temple** gates thrown open to women

## POLITICS AND SOCIETY: THEORIES OF POWER (104:26)

### Basic Definition

- **Politics**: Simply a struggle for power
- **Power** (WEBER's definition): The ability to influence, determine and control the actions of others irrespective of their will

## FUNCTIONAL THEORY OF POWER (108:05)

### PARSONS' Perspective

- **Power as societal resource**: Does not belong to individuals, belongs to society
- **Definition**: Power is the ability of a society to attain its goals
- **Comparison with money**: PARSONS compares power with money and politicians with banks

### The Banking Analogy

- People deposit money in banks for their own benefit (safety, interest income)
- Similarly, **people make deposits of their power in political leaders**
- Political leaders use these deposits of power to **pursue collective goals of society**
- Example: People deposited power in MODI through votes; he uses this power for "SABKA SAATH SABKA VIKAS"

### Power Withdrawal Mechanism

- If people not satisfied with benefits from political leadership, they can **revoke deposits of power**
- Can vest power in another political leadership (like changing banks for better interest rates)

| Banking System                         | Political System                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Deposit money for safety and interest  | Deposit power through votes                     |
| Bank uses money for collective benefit | Leaders use power for societal goals            |
| Can withdraw if unsatisfied            | Can revoke power through elections              |
| Society benefits from financial system | Whole society benefits from power differentials |

## MARXIST THEORY OF POWER (116:38)

### Core Marxist Perspective

- **Political system and state** are part of the **superstructure**
- Secures class interests of the **capitalist bourgeoisie**
- Legitimizes inequalities in the economy and helps maintain **status quo**
- **Source of political power lies in the economy**
- Those who control the economy also control the state

### MARX's Famous Remark

- **"The state is but a committee to manage the common affairs of the whole of bourgeoisie"**
- Government serves interests of capitalists regardless of political party in power
- All governments in capitalist system serve class interests of capitalists

### LOUIS ALTHUSSER's Contribution

- State in capitalist society serves capitalist interests through **two mechanisms**:
1. **Repressive State Apparatus**
   
   - Use of brute force and physical violence
   - Rarely used in practice

2. **Ideological State Apparatus**  ⭐ (This concept seems to be the primary mechanism according to the lecture, but the explanation could be clearer about how exactly this works in practice)
   
   - More relied upon mechanism
   - Ensures ideological conditioning of working class
   - Workers voluntarily submit to capitalist domination
   - Workers start seeing capitalist system as just, fair and reasonable

### Welfare State and Marxist Critique

- **Contemporary challenge**: How to explain welfare measures in Marxist framework?
- **WESTERGAARD and RESLER** argue: Welfare measures are **petty concessions** made by capitalist state to working class
- These concessions **diffuse revolutionary potential** of working class and **help stabilize capitalist system**
- Due to all-pervasive control of ruling class ideology, **capitalist system remains unchallenged and unquestioned**

### Direct vs Indirect Rule

- **POULANTZAS**: Political governing class is mostly different from capitalist class
- State enjoys **relative autonomy** from bourgeoisie
- **Reasons for separation**:
  1. Bourgeoisie is not a united class (intense competition among members)
  2. Need neutral arbiter to look after interests of whole bourgeoisie
  3. Can project myth that it represents all sections of society

## ZERO-SUM VS VARIABLE-SUM CONCEPTS OF POWER (141:05)

### Zero-Sum (Constant Sum) Concept

- **Total amount of power in society is fixed**
- If one section gains power, there must be consequent decrease in another's power
- One class gains only at expense of the other
- **Marxist theory** subscribes to zero-sum concept
- **WEBERIAN view** also sees power as zero-sum game

### Variable-Sum Concept

- **Total amount of power in society is not fixed**
- Can increase and decrease
- **PARSONS' functional theory** is variable-sum concept
- Power can increase through effective leadership
- Society as whole benefits when power is used effectively
- Not a zero-sum game where one gains at expense of others

| Power Concept | Theory               | Characteristics                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Zero-Sum      | Marxist, Weberian    | Fixed total power, one gains at other's expense      |
| Variable-Sum  | Functional (Parsons) | Power can increase/decrease, mutual benefit possible |

## CLASSICAL ELITE THEORY OF POWER (146:29)

### Definition of Elites

- **Elites are not the same as the rich**
- Those who are at the top echelons in whatever field
- Examples: Business elites, political elites, sporting elites, cultural elites
- Different from being wealthy - refers to "big people" in their respective domains

### PARETO and MOSCA's Classical Elite Theory

#### PARETO's Definition

- **Elite**: Refers to a class of people who have the **highest indices** in their branch of activity

#### Types of Elites (PARETO)

1. **Governing Elites**: Individuals who directly and indirectly play considerable part in government
2. **Non-Governing Elites**: Those who do not play any role in government

### Core Argument: Elite Rule is Inevitable

- **Throughout human history**, all societies have been ruled by elites
- A handful of people have ruled over the masses in every society at any point of time
- **Elite rule is inevitable**

### Psychological Basis of Elite Rule

- Result of certain **psychological traits**
- Those who possess psychological traits required to rule end up becoming governing elites
- Based on psychological traits and personality types, elites are of **two types**:

#### Lions and Foxes Classification

| Elite Type | Characteristics                  | Ruling Method                                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lions**  | Ruthless, decisive, conservative | Rule using **brute force**                          |
| **Foxes**  | Cunning, manipulative            | Rule by **cunning, manipulation, wheeling-dealing** |

### Masses Characteristics

- **Masses are passive**
- Have a **need to be led**
- Unconcerned about politics
- Don't have killer instinct or qualities required to become governing elites

### Circulation of Elites

- **"History is the graveyard of aristocracies"**
- Throughout history, only handful of people rule over vast majority
- **One elite rule is replaced by another**
- One set of elites will be replaced by another set of elites
- This **circulation of elites** continues through history

#### Reasons for Circulation

1. **Decline in Quality**: When elites come to power, they start decaying in quality due to privileges of office
2. **Imbalance of Qualities**: Any regime requires balance of both lion-type and fox-type qualities
   - Regime dominated by lions lacks cunning
   - Regime dominated by foxes lacks ability to use brute force

### Critique of Democratic Claims

- **Serious indictment of democracy**
- Democracy claims to be "government of the people, by the people, for the people"
- Elite theorists suggest **democracy is no different from other forms** of government
- **No major differences** between monarchy, dictatorship, theocracy, and democracy
- All are variations of same basic theme: **elite rule**
- In all political systems, handful of people rule over the masses
