# Weber's Social Action, Authority, and Bureaucracy

## Recap: Ideal Types and Social Action (25:31)

- **Ideal type**: In the most simplest form it can be said as a specified model type of a thing
- It is a kind of pure form where we do not actually get into the whole thing but we try to capture the highlights of a particular thing
- Not all the aspects of reality but certain features of it are absolutely captured and highlighted
- **Purpose of constructing ideal types**: It helps us to understand the social reality. It helps us to define, classify and investigate social phenomena. It's a methodological tool that the researcher uses

### Social Action Definition

- **Social action**: It is the meaningful act which is oriented in its course
- According to WEBER this is the subject matter of the discipline of sociology

## Types of Social Action (28:00)

### 1. Emotional Social Action

- **Example**: Parent beats child slaps child in a fit of rage

### 2. Traditional Social Action

- **Example**: Touching the feet of elders

### 3. Zweckrational Social Action

- **Definition**: Means and goals both are rationally chosen
- **Also known as**: Goal oriented rational social action, also known as formal rationality
- **Example**: Entry into the civil services through studying consistently etc.

### 4. Wertrational Social Action

- **Also known as**: Value oriented rational social action, also known as substantive rationality
- **Definition**: Goals may not be chosen rationally but the means are rational
- **Example**: Rejecting a bribe to uphold values of integrity and honesty by public officers

| Type of Social Action | Definition                             | Example                      | Alternative Name                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Emotional             | Action driven by emotions/feelings     | Parent hitting child in rage | Affectual                              |
| Traditional           | Action based on customs/traditions     | Touching feet of elders      | -                                      |
| Zweckrational         | Both means and goals rationally chosen | Studying for civil services  | Goal-oriented/Formal rationality       |
| Wertrational          | Means rational, goals value-based      | Officer rejecting bribe      | Value-oriented/Substantive rationality |

## Verstehen Method (31:20)

- **Verstehen**: Method to understand and interpret the meaning of social action
- **Two types of Verstehen**:

### 1. Aktuelles Verstehen (Direct Observational Understanding)

- Through direct observation you try to interpret the meaning

### 2. ErklÃ¤rendes Verstehen

- **Spelling**: E-R-K-L-A-R-E-N-D-E-S  V-E-R-S-T-E-H-E-N
- **Meaning**: To find the meaning of the action by putting in the shoes of the actor
- The researcher puts himself in the shoes of or in the place of the social actor

### Application of Verstehen Method

- Can be applied widely, not only in certain circumstances
- Can be applied to historical phenomena, diverse cultural settings, diverse social groups
- **WEBER's principle**: "One need not be Caesar in order to understand Caesar"

## Brief Discussion: Asiatic Mode of Production (35:07)

- **Characteristics**:
  - Land is owned by the village community collectively or communally
  - No private ownership of land
  - Villages are self-sufficient and exhibit a remarkable continuity
  - Monarch extracted tribute from the village communities
  - **Basis**: On the basis of military power and irrigation control over irrigation facilities

### Criticisms

- It wasn't very different from feudal Europe
- STALIN banned it

## Commodity Fetishism Discussion (37:20)

- **Reification**: Everything turns into a thing
- **Concept given by**: GEORGE LUKACS

### Commodity and Commodity Fetishism

- **Commodities**: Those things which are bought and sold in the market
- **Exchange value**: Different from use value
- **Use value**: The utility of a thing to man
- **Commodity fetishism**: The work of the labor attached to the product. The commodities are depersonalized. The laborers are not associated with the product of their own labor
- According to MARX, commodities don't actually have intrinsic value, but because of commodity fetishism, stakeholders assume there is some intrinsic value associated to the product

## Rationalization (47:16)

- **Definition**: Rationalization means that rational action becomes the dominant form of social action in modern society, instead of emotions, traditions or the supernatural guiding social action

### Key Components of Rationalization

- **Social action is increasingly driven by rationality**
- **Rationality refers to**: Those ideas and behaviors that are logically coherent and consistent with empirical knowledge
- **Rationalization refers to**: The process whereby rationality is applied to various aspects of life

### Modernization and Rationalization

- According to WEBER, the process of modernization entails increasing rationalization
- Human action no more relies upon magic, religion or tradition
- Increasingly, individuals rely upon logic, reason, and calculation
- Quantification and predictability become important

### Weber's Definition of Rationalization

> "There are no mysterious, incalculable forces that come into play. Rather, one can master all things by calculation."

### Disenchantment of the World

- **The process of rationalization involves**: A progressive disenchantment of the world, and the eradication of mystery, emotion, and tradition, and its replacement by rational calculation
- **Premodern society**: Was literally an enchanted land where man was continuously in awe of various natural social phenomena that he encountered
- **With modernization**: People start relying upon cold calculation, logic and reason in various areas of activity
- **Result**: The sense of mystery, wonder, and awe that prevailed in the premodern period is now swept away

### Spheres Affected by Rationalization

- The process of rationalization affects the economy, law, administration and religion
- It underpins the emergence of capitalism and bureaucracy
- Whether it is the emergence of capitalism, the prevalence of bureaucracy, in law, everywhere you see rationalization
- Even in religion, religion becomes increasingly demystified

### Example of Rationalization

- **Farmer wanting to increase crop yield**:
  - **Premodern approach**: Perform detailed rituals, rely upon supernatural forces, divine interventions
  - **Modern approach**: Dig a well to provide water for fields, rely on logic, reason, calculation

## Authority and Power (66:49)

### Understanding Authority

- **Authority**: Having control over others, legitimate source of power, power with responsibility
- **Authority is**: That power which is considered as just, fair and reasonable by those who are subjected to it
- **Power refers to**: The ability of a person or group to influence, determine and control the actions of others irrespective of their will

### Power as Relational Concept

- **Power is a relational concept**: One holds power in relation to certain others
- **Examples**: 
  - Father has power over children
  - Government has power to extract taxes
  - Men enjoy power over women in patriarchal societies
  - Capitalists have power over working-class people

### Types of Power

| Type                          | Definition                              | Example                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Legitimate Power (Authority)  | Power considered just, fair, reasonable | Traffic cop issuing challan              |
| Illegitimate Power (Coercion) | Power not regarded as just and fair     | Street goon demanding wallet at gunpoint |

### Legal vs Legitimate

- **Legal and legitimacy are not the same**
- **Legal**: Something which has a basis in law
- **Legitimate**: Something which is considered as justified, reasonable, fair and is accepted on that basis
- A source of power may be:
  - Legitimate but not legal (husband's traditional authority over wife in traditional household)
  - Both legal and legitimate (traffic cop's authority)
  - Legal but not legitimate (government authority from perspective of separatist groups)

### Dynamic Nature of Authority

- The same power being exercised on the same persons can be considered legitimate at some time and illegitimate at another
- **Example**: Parental authority over children - considered legitimate during childhood, may be resented during rebellious teenage years
- Authority is bounded, not unlimited - even highest authority figures have limits to their legitimate power

## Weber's Three Types of Authority (90:58)

### 1. Traditional Authority

- **Definition**: When the followers obey an authority because they believe in the rightness of obeying holders of traditional status
- **Example**: Monarchy - ruler is obeyed because he is the son of the previous ruler whom forefathers obeyed
- **Authority structure**: Typically involves a household of personal servants and a number of lords and officials who swear allegiance to the monarch

#### Characteristics of Traditional Authority

- The roles and obligations governing the conduct of various authority holders/officials is defined by customs and traditions, but may be modified by the ruler
- The authority of the monarch is also mostly not absolute as it is also limited by tradition
- **Examples**: Feudal lords' authority, monarchs' authority

### 2. Charismatic Authority

- **Charisma definition**: An ability to inspire, an aura that elicits a sort of devotion
- **Charisma refers to**: Perceived supernatural or superhuman qualities, or at least exceptional qualities in a leader, which inspires people to establish an emotional connect with him and they obey him on that basis

#### Understanding Charisma

- **Not about**: Success, good looks, charm, or excellent public speaking skills
- **About**: The ability to rouse devotion amongst followers who perceive exceptional, nearly supernatural qualities in the charismatic person
- **Originally religious**: The term charisma had religious connotation, associated with founders of major religions

#### Examples of Charismatic Figures

- **Religious figures**: JESUS CHRIST, PROPHET MUHAMMAD, GURU NANAK, GAUTAM BUDDHA, MAHAVIR
- **Political leaders**: MAHATMA GANDHI, HITLER â­ (mentioned as example of charismatic authority, not endorsement)
- **Modern examples**: NARENDRA MODI, MS DHONI, SACHIN TENDULKAR

#### Characteristics of Charismatic Authority

- **Authority structure**: Fluid and ill-defined, no clear hierarchy of officials, no general rules which are applied
- **Revenue sources**: Does not have clear well-defined sources of revenue, typically relies upon charity or plunder
- **Nature**: Short-lived by nature

### 3. Rational-Legal Authority

- **Definition**: Authority that is obeyed by the followers because it is derived from a legal framework or rational rules and considerations which are considered as legitimate by the followers
- **Examples**: Authority of traffic cop, judge, income tax evaluation officer
- **Modern dominance**: Rational legal authority dominates in modern industrial society

| Authority Type | Basis of Legitimacy                                  | Structure                           | Duration                     | Examples                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Traditional    | Custom, tradition, inherited status                  | Fixed hierarchy based on customs    | Long-lasting, generational   | Monarchy, feudal lords                    |
| Charismatic    | Personal qualities, perceived supernatural abilities | Fluid, ill-defined                  | Short-lived, person-specific | Religious founders, revolutionary leaders |
| Rational-Legal | Laws, rational rules, constitutional framework       | Clearly defined hierarchy and rules | Stable, institutional        | Modern bureaucracy, government officials  |

## Routinization of Charisma (127:00)

### Problem of Charismatic Authority

- **Charismatic authority is short-lived**: Unlike traditional or rational legal authority, charismatic authority continues person after person, generation after generation
- **Why short-lived**: Because it emanates from the person - at best charismatic authority will last till the lifetime of the charismatic leader
- **Can be lost sooner**: If followers stop perceiving supernatural qualities in the leader

### Examples of Lost Charisma

- **ASARAM BAPU**: Was charismatic figure but taint of sexual allegations and incarceration weaned off that charisma in the eyes of many followers

### The Solution: Routinization

- **Routinization of charisma**: Refers to the process of transformation of charismatic authority into traditional authority or rational legal authority
- **Purpose**: While charisma is person specific and therefore short lived, routinization enables charismatic authority to sustain beyond the lifetime of the charismatic leader though in a somewhat changed form

### Examples of Routinization

- **JESUS CHRIST's authority**: Transformed into traditional authority enjoyed by the Catholic Church and Christian traditions
- **MAHATMA GANDHI's authority**: 
  - Transformed into rational-legal form through Gandhian principles incorporated into constitutional legal framework (Gandhian directive principles of state policy, village promotion, cattle protection)
  - Also transformed into traditional form where present Gandhis seek votes in the name of Gandhi, tracing lineage from Gandhi
- **PROPHET MUHAMMAD's authority**: Transformed into both traditional form (Islamic traditions) and rational legal authority (basis of law in several Muslim countries)

## Bureaucracy (142:59)

### Definition and Etymology

- **Bureaucracy**: Bureau + cracy
- **Bureau**: Desk or office
- **Cracy**: Rule of
- **Meaning**: Those who rule from sitting behind the desk (to contrast with politicians who operate in the field)

### Basic Understanding

- **Part of government**: Part of the executive branch
- **Permanent executive**: Unlike politicians (temporary executive/ministers), bureaucrats form the permanent executive
- **Selection**: Officials are selected, not elected
- **Merit-based**: Authority is earned based upon merit or ability, gauged through competitive exams

### Why Bureaucracy is Necessary

- **Modern societies are large scale**: Having lakhs and millions of members
- **Large scale tasks**: Services have to be provided to millions of people, law and order maintained spanning large territory
- **Global phenomenon**: Bureaucracy exists in all modern societies (India, US, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco)

### Organizational Structure

- **Large scale tasks divided**: Governing India divided into smaller parts (defense, finance, education, foreign relations)
- **Further subdivision**: Each area further subdivided into manageable tasks
- **Hierarchical structure**: One person/authority figure assigned one area or domain
- **Clear demarcation**: Every person assigned clearly demarcated area of authority and responsibility

### Weber's Definition

- **Bureaucracy is**: A hierarchical organization which is designed rationally to coordinate the work of many persons in order to accomplish large scale tasks and achieve organizational goals
- **For Weber**: Bureaucracy is an expression of rational legal authority

### Examples of Hierarchical Structure

- **Highest level**: Cabinet Secretary (highest ranking bureaucrat)
- **Ministry level**: Defense Secretary, Finance Secretary, Education Secretary
- **Lower levels**: Additional Secretaries, Joint Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries
- **Domain specificity**: Education secretary does not have say in defense matters - that is solely the domain of defense secretary
