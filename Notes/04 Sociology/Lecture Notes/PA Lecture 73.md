# Rural Sociology: Village Studies and the Idea of the Indian Village

## Introduction to Rural Sociology and Village Studies (11:48)

- **Rural Sociology Focus**: Comprehensive coverage of syllabus topics including village studies, the idea of the Indian village, land reforms, green revolution, mode of production in Indian agriculture, community development programs, cooperatives, factionalism, and current situation of Indian agriculture
- **Context**: Understanding current status in the context of globalization and LPG era
- **Primary Agenda**: Village studies, land reforms, green revolution, mode of production in Indian agriculture, peasant and farmers movements

### Why Study Villages?

- **Statistical Significance**: As per 2011 census, **68.8% of India's population lives in villages**
- **Understanding Indian Society**: To understand Indian society, we must get acquainted with the rural dimension or rural sociology - the village community
- **Historical Context**: At the time of independence, **82.7% of the population resided in villages**

## Historical Development of Village Studies (27:00)

### Colonial Period Beginnings

- **Systematic Documentation**: During the colonial period, very systematic detailed information about rural lives began to be collected
- **Sources**: Rich information collected by the British state and anthropologists
- **Publications**: Government published many district gazetteers and village handbooks containing detailed accounts of village life
- **Contributors**: Efforts undertaken by company officials, crown officials, anthropologists, and missionaries

### Ancient References

- **Historical Importance**: Even in ancient texts like ARTHASHASTRA, MAHABHARATA, MANUSMRITI, we find mention of the importance of knowing about village life for administrators and rulers

### Golden Period (1950s-1960s)

- **Peak Era**: Village studies really blossomed during 1950s and 60s, more so in 50s
- **Golden Period**: This was the golden period of village studies in Indian sociology and anthropology
- **Methodology**: Sociologists and anthropologists would spend months in villages, living amongst villagers, conducting personal interviews, taking detailed notes through observation
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: They collected information about all aspects of village life - religion, man-woman relations, rituals, family system, kinship patterns

## Reasons for Flourishing of Village Studies in 1950s (33:46)

### 1. Transformation from Police State to Welfare State

- **State Character Change**: After independence, the character of the Indian state changed from police state to welfare state
- **Colonial Purpose**: British collected information for limited purposes - revenue collection and administration, law and order maintenance
- **Post-Independence Purpose**: Indian state functions expanded substantially as it transformed to focus on welfare of the people

### 2. Centralized Planning Requirements

- **Planning Structure**: Era of centralized planning with Planning Commission handling resource allocation and targets
- **Input Requirements**: Planners at central level required inputs from the ground level
- **Crucial Role**: Village studies provided crucial inputs for the centralized planning process

### 3. Policy Evaluation Needs

- **Assessment Tool**: Village studies helped evaluate the impact of government policies, schemes, programs, and legislation
- **Examples**: 
  - Whether untouchability prohibition was translating into social reality
  - Whether schools were truly open to all or still dominated by traditional high castes
  - Whether land reforms actually transferred ownership from traditional landowning classes to intended beneficiaries

### 4. Western Academic Influence

- **International Context**: Influence of western academia where focus on rural society had picked up
- **ROBERT REDFIELD**: Developed concept of **peasant society** creating renewed interest in agrarian rural societies
- **Indian Fit**: India fitted well with this notion of peasant society
- **Funding**: A lot of money for village studies came from the West

### 5. Cold War Geopolitical Climate

- **International Competition**: Both US-led capitalist and Soviet-led eastern blocks wanted to draw newly freed countries like India to their side
- **Financial Support**: They pumped in money for village studies to demonstrate effectiveness of their systems

### 6. Structural Functional Approach Dominance

- **Academic Approach**: 1950s and 60s were dominated by the structural functional approach in Indian sociology and anthropology
- **MN SRINIVAS**: Following MN SRINIVAS, many anthropologists undertook village studies in different parts of the country
- **Methodological Preference**: Structural functional scholars championed field study and village studies methodology

## Challenges Faced During Village Studies (47:39)

### 1. Difficulty in Fitting into Rural Social Landscape

- **Trust Building**: Researchers had to win over villagers' trust and gain entry into the village
- **Purpose Justification**: Need to convince villagers of benign, harmless purpose of their presence
- **Closed Society**: Villages were closed societies that may not be welcoming to outsiders

### 2. Difficulties in Adjustment

- **Long Stay Requirements**: Typically involved long stays of several months
- **Rural Environment**: Less facilities and amenities than city life to which researchers were accustomed
- **Basic Infrastructure**: Many villages were without electricity or had intermittent electricity supply

### 3. Language Barriers

- **Communication Issues**: Language barriers could be overcome through translators or researchers conveniently chose states whose languages they knew

### 4. Non-responsiveness

- **Information Reluctance**: Villagers may not be forthcoming to outsiders, especially when researchers had to probe into personal matters
- **Incomplete Information**: People might not reveal true or complete information

### 5. Lack of Access to Female Respondents

- **Patriarchal Constraints**: Strong hold of patriarchy in villages meant researchers had less access to female respondents
- **Gender Bias**: Overwhelmingly, researchers were male, creating additional barriers to accessing women's perspectives

### 6. Upper Caste Perspective Bias

- **Researcher Background**: Researchers were frequently upper caste and would typically reside in the Brahman section of the village
- **Limited Viewpoint**: This resulted in an upper caste perspective in the picture they developed
- **Lower Caste Hesitation**: Lower castes may not be forthcoming or may fear giving truthful responses, assuming researchers to be Brahmans

### 7. Subjectivity Issues

- **Objectivity Challenge**: Maintaining objectivity was particularly challenging if researcher belonged to the same social or cultural milieu as the village environment
- **MN SRINIVAS Example**: Would face more objectivity problems researching a village in Karnataka versus Assam

### 8. Note-taking and Documentation Challenges

- **Detailed Documentation**: Need to take very detailed and exhaustive notes for later reference
- **Risk of Loss**: Notes could get lost or displaced (example: remembered village written from memory after notes were lost in fire)

### 9. Ideological Bias

- **Functionalist Perspective**: Most researchers were functionalists who emphasized cooperation, harmony, integration
- **Conflict Downplay**: They tended to ignore or downplay conflicts in their accounts of rural India

## Criticisms of Village Studies (62:25)

### 1. DUMONT and POCOCK Criticism

- **Administrative Unit Argument**: Village is merely a geographical area or administrative unit with no wider social significance
- **Social Institution Focus**: As sociologists/anthropologists, we should focus on social institutions like caste, patriarchy, family structure, kinship
- **Geographical Limitation**: Studying a village is like doing sociology of a piece of land rather than social arrangements

### 2. Diversity Argument

- **No Uniform Indian Village**: There is no such thing called an Indian village due to lot of diversity in rural life in different parts of the country
- **Regional Variations**: Village in Assam is very different from Karnataka, which differs from Gujarat, which differs from Kashmir
- **Generalization Problem**: Cannot generalize due to diversity in rural social lives

### 3. DIPANKAR GUPTA's Contemporary Critique

- **Book**: "WITHER THE INDIAN VILLAGE" (2005)
- **Outdated Approach**: Village studies were useful in 1950s but are outdated today as Indian society has moved past them
- **Defining Features Lost**: Two defining features of Indian villages were:
  1. **Agriculture as main source of economy**
  2. **Caste system**
- **Current Reality**: Both agriculture and caste have diminished importance in rural society
- **Hollowed Out Villages**: Many villages wear a deserted look with people working in nearby towns/cities during day, returning only to sleep
- **Economic Transformation**: Agriculture no longer contributes bulk of income generated in rural areas

### 4. S.S. JODHKA's Modification Approach

- **Book**: "VILLAGE SOCIETY"
- **Update Requirement**: Need to update and modify village studies rather than discard them altogether
- **Newer Themes**: Should incorporate newer themes like:
  - Ecological concerns
  - Impact of communication technologies
  - Mobile phone effects
- **Rejuvenation**: Indian sociology needs to rejuvenate village studies and widen their ambit to address newer themes

## Defense of Village Studies (82:25)

### Responses by MN SRINIVAS and Others

#### Village as Social Identity

- **Identity Significance**: In India, village is not merely a geographical space but very important part of one's social identity
- **Name Integration**: Many across the length and breadth append village name to their names over generations
- **Examples**: HARIDWAR HALI (HALI is village name), numerous examples across states

#### Strong Sense of Belonging

- **Attachment**: People have very strong sense of attachment and belonging to their village
- **MN SRINIVAS Quote**: "An insult to one's village has to be avenged just like an insult to one's mother or wife"

#### Village as Cohesive Unit

- **Internal Divisions Acknowledged**: No doubt there are divisions and clashes along caste lines
- **Overarching Unity**: Despite divisions, there is overarching sense of oneness or unity
- **External Perception**: For outsiders, village appears as one unit
- **Interdependence**: More defining feature is interdependence, reciprocity, exchange, regular cooperation between castes

#### Common Features Across Indian Villages

- **Universal Elements**: Despite diversity, certain features are common to villages throughout the country:
  - **Caste system** with features of endogamy, hierarchy, occupational specification
  - **Patriarchy**
  - **Importance of land**
  - **Reverence for tradition**

#### Civilizational Representation

- **India in Miniature**: Every village represents India in miniature
- **Civilizational Values**: Village represents the civilizational values of India
- **Core Elements**: Whatever is of utmost importance to Indians is of utmost importance to villagers - whether caste, joint family, religion, community, kinship, or respecting the elderly

## The Idea of the Indian Village (108:48)

### 1. Colonial View

#### CHARLES METCALF's "Little Republics"

- **Key Phrase**: Indian villages are **"little republics"**
- **Characteristics**: Villages were seen as:
  - **Economically self-sufficient**
  - **Politically autonomous** 
  - **Socially isolated**

#### Metcalf's Description

- **Quote**: "The Indian villages are little republics. They have nearly everything that they want within and are independent of any foreign relations. Wars may pass over it, regimes may come and go, but the village as a community always remains unchanged, unshaken and self-sufficient"

#### Self-Sufficiency Explanation

- **Economic**: Economy governed by jajmani system where different castes fulfilled each other's needs
- **Political**: Simple administration system through caste-based governance
- **Social**: Thousands of years old mechanisms to settle disputes internally

#### HENRY MAINE's View

- **Characterization**: Termed village as **"the least destructible unit"** of Indian society
- **Continuity**: Despite fluidity at central political level, ground level witnessed remarkable continuity

#### Material Condition

- **Fatalistic Attitude**: Despite not being materially prosperous, villages were self-sufficient due to fatalistic attitude and few expectations from life

#### KARL MARX's Perspective

- **Stagnation**: Saw Indian villages as primarily unchanging, associated with stagnation in rural economy

### 2. Gandhian View

#### Similarities with Colonial View

- **Self-Sufficiency**: Like British, GANDHI saw Indian villages as self-sufficient and autonomous units

#### Key Difference

- **Destruction by Colonialism**: For GANDHI, self-sufficiency of Indian villages had been destroyed by policies of the colonial state
- **British Responsibility**: British policies had ruined the self-sufficiency and autonomy of Indian villages

#### Gandhi's Vision

- **Swaraj = Gram Swaraj**: Equated political independence from British rule with restoration of village level autonomy
- **Preference for Village Life**: Greatly preferred simplicity and authenticity of village life over chaos and consumerism of cities
- **Simple Living**: Only in villages can you have simple life close to nature, devoid of mindless consumerism

#### Policy Implications

- **Decentralization**: Championed decentralization to empower village autonomy
- **Charkha Symbol**: Made charkha symbol of anti-colonial struggle, representing handspun cloth over advanced machinery
- **Village Industries**: Promoted village industries and cottage industries

### 3. AMBEDKAR's View

#### Stark Contrast to Gandhi

- **Critical Perspective**: Villages are **"cesspool of factionalism and dens of inequity"**
- **Social Problems**: Villages characterized by:
  - Untouchability and caste-based discrimination
  - Subordination of women
  - Gross inequalities
  - Operation and exploitation

#### No Romanticization

- **Realistic View**: Did not have romanticized or rosy understanding of rural society
- **Site of Oppression**: Saw villages as sites of discrimination, exploitation and oppression along caste and gender lines

### 4. NEHRU's View

#### Contrast with Gandhi

- **Mentor Opposition**: View was in stark contrast to his mentor GANDHI
- **Closer to Ambedkar**: Closer to AMBEDKAR's perspective than GANDHI's

#### Villages as Backward

- **Intellectual Backwardness**: People are irrational, don't have scientific temper
- **Cultural Backwardness**: Caught in cobweb of caste and religion reduced to meaningless superstition and rituals

#### Development Approach

- **Transformation Focus**: Agreed on focusing on villages but through **modernization**
- **National Development**: Equated national development with village upliftment
- **Policy Translation**: 
  - Modern education through schools
  - Modern healthcare facilities
  - Infrastructure development (roads)
  - Spread of scientific temper
  - Later, agricultural modernization

### 5. Academic/Scholarly View

#### Challenge to Colonial Notion

- **MN SRINIVAS, AM SHAH, ANDRE BETEILLE, DUBET** and others challenged colonial notion of villages as little republics

#### Never Self-Sufficient Argument

- **Historical Reality**: Neither today nor in past have Indian villages been self-sufficient, isolated and autonomous
- **Constant Contact**: Always had contact and exchange with other villages and wider region

#### Evidence of Interconnectedness

- **Economic Ties**: 
  
  - Jajmani ties often spanned across village boundaries
  - Weekly markets (haats) where people from several regions would come
  - International trade relations for coastal villages

- **Political Ties**: 
  
  - Always central authority extracting tribute/tax
  - Caste panchayats operated across villages

- **Social Ties**: 
  
  - Village exogamy requiring dependence on other villages for marriage
  - Kinship ties connecting villages
  - Land ownership across village boundaries
  - Religious pilgrimage ties

#### Conclusion

- **SRINIVAS, AM SHAH, SATISH SABERWAL, YOGENDRA SINGH**: Village was always part of wider economic, political and religious system
- **Illusion**: The isolation, autonomy and self-sufficiency of Indian village is an illusion

## Land Tenure Systems and Changes (142:54)

### Colonial Land Tenure Systems

#### Major Systems Introduced

- **ZAMINDARI**: Most exploitative system with absentee landlordism
- **MAHALWARI**: Intermediate system
- **RYOTWARI**: Relatively most benign as ryots directly paid tax to state
- **JAGIRDARI**: Another variant system

#### H. WANKAR SUBBA's Analysis

- **Simultaneous Operation**: These systems were not operating in isolation but working simultaneously in different parts
- **Experimentation**: British were also experimenting, not clear which system would work best
- **Continuous Exchange**: Lot of exchange and inter-learnings between systems
- **1940s Convergence**: By 1940, systems became nearly indistinguishable from each other
- **Zamindari Approximation**: All four were approximating increasingly to zamindari type
- **Universal Exploitation**: All became quite exploitative by end of colonial rule

### Impact of Colonial Systems

- **Widespread Revolts**: Numerous revolts and uprisings due to exploitative nature
- **National Leadership Awareness**: National leadership was acutely aware of peasantry's concerns and conditions

## Land Reforms After Independence (150:15)

### Administrative Framework

- **State Subject**: Land reforms primarily implemented by state governments
- **Central Vision**: Overall vision laid down by national leadership
- **Congress Coordination**: Both center and most states had Congress governments implementing Nehruvian vision

### Major Land Reform Measures

#### 1. Abolition of Intermediaries

- **Zamindari Abolition Acts**: Removed intermediary landlords

#### 2. Tenancy Reforms

- **Security of Tenure**: Provided security so tenants cannot be dismissed arbitrarily
- **Rent Regulation**: Regulated rent to prevent exploitation (previously up to 60% of produce)

#### 3. Land Ceiling Acts

- **Ownership Limits**: Capped total amount of land that could be owned by one person/family

#### 4. Land Redistribution

- **Redistribution to Landless**: Measures for redistributing land to landless

### Three Approaches to Land Reforms (P.C. JOSHI)

#### 1. Gandhian Approach

- **Trusteeship Concept**: Wealthy are custodians of societal wealth held in trust for welfare
- **BHOODAN Movement**: Led by VINOBA BHAVE, meaning "to donate land"
- **Voluntary Donation**: Rich should voluntarily donate wealth for redistribution among landless
- **Dismal Failure**: 
  - Target: 50 million acres
  - Collected: 4 million acres
  - Redistributed: Less than 1 million acres
  - **Quality Issues**: Much donated land was rocky, barren, or stuck in litigation

#### 2. Marxist Approach

- **Class Analysis**: In feudal agrarian society, land owned by rich minority while masses are landless
- **Government Limitations**: Government represents interests of rich and powerful
- **Bloody Revolution**: Only solution is to finish off class enemy and grab lands/properties
- **Indian Implementation**: Naxalite movement followed this approach

#### 3. Radical Nationalist Approach

- **Socialistic Pattern**: Establish socialistic pattern of society
- **Not Communism**: Means preventing concentration of wealth and reducing inequalities
- **Indian State Adoption**: This approach adopted by Indian state after independence

## Impact of Land Reforms (163:49)

### Regional Variations in Success

#### More Successful States

- **Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal**: Relatively more successful implementation

#### Less Successful States

- **Uttar Pradesh, Bihar**: Less successful in Hindi belt states

### Scholarly Assessments

#### WALTER FERNANDEZ

- **Half-hearted Implementation**: Land reforms implemented half-heartedly
- **Continued Inequalities**: Inequalities in land ownership have continued

#### MALCOLM ADISESHIAH

- **Increased Inequalities**: Land reforms seem to have increased inequalities
- **Mechanism**: Landlords stopped giving land to cultivators to avoid "land to tiller" policies, worsening landless peasants' condition

#### N.C. SAXENA

- **Bureaucratic Bias**: State governments were prejudicial and biased
- **Elite Retention**: Big farmers able to retain large land holdings

#### RUDOLPH and RUDOLPH

- **Book**: "IN PURSUIT OF LAKSHMI"
- **Caste Shift**: Land ownership shifted from high castes (Brahmans, Rajputs, Bhumihars) to intermediate castes (Jats, Yadavs)
- **Political Assertion**: This contributed to political assertion by intermediate castes

#### PAUL BRASS

- **Congress Impact**: Land reforms hurt Congress party politically
- **High Caste Dominance**: Congress dominated by high castes
- **Regional Parties**: Intermediate castes established regional parties and displaced Congress
- **Political Outcome**: Led to regional parties and eventually Janata Party giving India first farmer Prime Minister CHAUDHARY CHARAN SINGH

#### DOSHI and JAIN

- **Gender Neglect**: Land reforms ignored women cultivators' right to ownership
- **Positive Outcomes**: 
  - New proprietors took greater interest in land improvement and increased productivity
  - Some ex-landlords took up new occupations contributing to national economy
- **Overall Assessment**: Land reforms failed to establish socialistic pattern of society

### Reasons for Limited Success

#### Lack of Political Will

- **Elite Background**: Social background of legislators belonged to landed classes

#### Legal Loopholes

- **Ceiling Law Exploitation**: Legal provisions exploited to retain large holdings
- **Self-cultivation Exemption**: Could retain land for self-cultivation needs
- **Benami Transfers**: Administrative connivance enabled fake transfers

#### Judicial Delays

- **Court Proceedings**: Long legal processes hindered effective implementation
