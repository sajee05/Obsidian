# Marx's Theory of Historical Materialism - UPSC Sociology Notes

## Introduction and Weekly Assignment Discussion (31:49)

- Good afternoon friends. Apologies for the delay
- We skipped the recap because of your teacher's fault
- Weekly assignment questions were mostly application based questions and many found them perturbing
- **Application Based Questions**: From topics like Parsons and Merton, UPSC has been giving application based questions
- **Reassurance**: They won't ask you the same thing again - if they've asked you to apply Merton's theory of reference group for understanding fashion, they won't ask you to apply to fashion again
- We'll discuss the application based questions tomorrow in the next lecture

## Merton's Theory of Deviance - Criticisms and Limitations (35:50)

### Major Limitations of Merton's Theory

1. **Limited Scope**:
   
   - MERTON through his theory explained deviance specifically in American society
   - It is not like a universal framework or theory which can help us understand deviance in all societies
   - The application of his theory of deviance in other context would be limited
   - UPSC in its wisdom asks you to apply MERTON's theory of deviance to understand traffic problem in urban India

2. **Cannot Explain Non-Utilitarian Crime** (as pointed out by ALBERT COHEN):
   
   - MERTON's theory does not explain non-utilitarian crime
   - **Utilitarian Crime**: The theory explains quite well - crime that is of any utility or benefit to the criminal
   - Example: Robbing a bank can be explained as innovation (getting money when institutionalized means are blocked)
   - **Non-Utilitarian Crime**: Like vandalism, defacing public property, burning buses - this theory can't help you make sense of these crimes

3. **Ignores Differential Access to Illegitimate Opportunities** (CLOWARD and OHLIN):
   
   - MERTON's theory does not take into account that people have differential access to the illegitimate opportunity structure
   - The theory takes into account unequal access to legitimate opportunity structure but not illegitimate ones
   - **Example**: A poor boy in Mumbai has greater chance of becoming a don than one in Bengaluru because Mumbai has a thriving underworld culture
   - Similarly, a boy in Bihar is more likely to become a kidnapper than one in Himachal Pradesh due to flourishing kidnapping industry

4. **Psychological Factors Ignored**:
   
   - MERTON's theory does not take into account psychological factors
   - Critics argue they cannot be ignored completely
   - Not all the poor become robbers or thieves
   - Not all persons who fail take to drugs or alcohol

5. **Cannot Explain White Collar Crime**:
   
   - MERTON's theory does not adequately explain white collar crime
   - **White Collar Crime**: Crime done by the educated middle and upper middle class or upper class people, or done by professionals
   - Financial bungling is done by educated professionals like accountants, auditors, and bankers
   - They mostly do not get punished - clear class bias in law application
   - Jails are filled with poor, lower class people while rich go scot-free
   - **MARXIST Sociologists** point out clear power differentials between rich and poor - law is not equally applicable to all

## Karl Marx - Introduction and Background (48:31)

### Marx's Influence and Significance

- **KARL MARX's** influence goes far beyond the realms of the narrow academic discipline of sociology

- MARX was a sociologist, economist, historian, political scientist, journalist, revolutionary, and philosopher
- He resides alongside the three most influential human beings to have ever walked on the planet earth
- **The Other Two**: JESUS CHRIST and Prophet MUHAMMAD (in terms of religious demographics and followers)
- "You may love him or hate him but you cannot ignore him" - you are either a Marxist or vehemently anti-Marxist

- **Death**: Died stateless (without citizenship of any country)
- **Financial Support**: Steady source of income was the beneficiary of his friend and co-author FREDERICK ENGELS

## UPSC Syllabus Topics for Marx (57:31)

Four main topics under KARL MARX for UPSC sociology syllabus:

1. **Historical Materialism**
2. **Mode of Production**  
3. **Alienation**
4. **Class Struggle**

## Understanding Marx's Framework (58:49)

### Student Inputs on Marx's Ideas

- He was a conflict theorist
- He criticized the capitalist framework of society
- He believed capitalism will be replaced by socialist and communist society
- He was against religion
- He highlighted economic inequality and society being divided into haves and have nots
- He saw everything through an economic lens
- He envisaged a future classless society called communist society

## Hegel's Influence on Marx (61:19)

### Understanding Hegel's Idealism

- **HEGEL** was the intellectual predecessor of MARX
- MARX was a self-admitted pupil of HEGEL
- HEGEL is not in UPSC syllabus - we study him only to understand MARX

#### Hegel as an Idealist

- **HEGEL** is known as an idealist or he believed in idealism
- **Idealism** (philosophical meaning): He gave primacy to ideas
- According to HEGEL, ideas are primary, material reality is secondary
- **Process**: Ideas or thoughts come first, subsequently they get manifested in the form of material reality
- **Example**: Somebody must have first thought of the idea of a wheel, and only then would the material physical wheel have come into existence

#### How Changes Take Place According to Hegel

- **Changes in society take place due to changes in the realm of ideas**
- As our ideas change, our society and the material reality around us also changes
- **Method**: Ideas evolve or change through the dialectical method

### The Dialectical Method

#### Origins and Contrast with Debate

- Originally used by SOCRATES (Greek philosopher, teacher of PLATO)
- **Dialectics vs Debate**:
  - **Debate**: Speakers for and against a topic, one declared winner based on better arguments
  - **Dialectics**: Instead of one being winner, proceeds through thesis-antithesis-synthesis

#### The Dialectical Process

**Structure**: 

- **Thesis**: The original idea
- **Antithesis**: The opposite idea  
- **Synthesis**: New idea which is combination of these two opposing ideas

**Example**: 

- **Student 1 (Thesis)**: "Marriage is the beautiful social institution, coming together of two souls, companionship, love"
- **Student 2 (Antithesis)**: "Marriage is a headache, characterized by antagonism, war of two sexes, unnecessary adjustment"
- **SOCRATES (Synthesis)**: "It's a necessary evil" - combining both ideas

### Three Laws of Dialectical Method

#### 1. Law of Unity and Conflict of Opposites

- Thesis and antithesis are opposed to each other (conflict)
- But they also unite to give rise to synthesis (unity)
- Two antagonistic or opposing forces combine to give rise to a new idea

#### 2. Law of Passage of Quantitative Changes into Qualitative Change

- **Definition**: Small incremental changes have a combined effect of producing a qualitatively different outcome
- **Water Example**: 
  - Cold water heated on gas stove
  - Temperature increases gradually (quantitative changes)
  - Eventually transforms into vapor (qualitatively different outcome)
- **Paradox of the Heap**: 
  - 10 lakh grains of sand (heap)
  - Remove one grain at a time
  - Eventually becomes non-heap
- **Child Growth Example**: 
  - Daily incremental growth barely noticeable
  - Over 10 years: 3-year-old to 13-year-old is qualitatively different

#### 3. Law of Negation of Negation

- **Definition**: Every stage is a negation of the previous stage, which itself is a negation of the stage prior to it
- Progress takes place through destruction
- You have to destroy the old to create the new
- Progress takes place by destruction of the old and its replacement by the new

## Marx's Relationship with Hegel (84:18)

### Young Hegelians

- MARX belonged to a group called **Young Hegelians**
- Group of scholars influenced by HEGEL but also very critical of HEGEL

### What Marx Rejected from Hegel

- **Rejected**: HEGEL's emphasis on the primacy of ideas (idealism)
- MARX said: "We put HEGEL upside down"
- **MARX's Position**: Material reality is primary, ideas are secondary
- MARX is known as a **materialist** (opposite of HEGEL's idealism)

### What Marx Retained from Hegel

- **Retained**: The Hegelian method of dialectics
- **Application**: Applied the dialectical method to the realm of material reality
- Society changes through dialectical process, but in the realm of matter, not ideas

## Marx's Materialist Philosophy (86:47)

### Core Principle

- **According to MARX**: Ideas are shaped by the material reality
- Our ideas are shaped by our material reality
- Changes in the realm of matter define the course of human history
- Ideas are secondary, merely a reflection of material reality
- **We cannot think beyond our material reality**

### Marx's Logic for Materialism

**Sequential Logic**:

1. **In order to think, man must live**
2. **In order to live, man must eat** 
3. **In order to eat, man must produce**

**Conclusion**: **Production of the basic necessities of life is the first historical act**

### Marx's Famous Quote

> "It is not the consciousness of man that determines his being. It is his social being that determines his consciousness." - KARL MARX

- Your consciousness, thoughts, ideas are a function of your material reality
- This sentence captures the essence of MARX's materialist philosophy

### Example of Material Reality Shaping Ideas

- **Child in Delhi (upper middle class)**: Can think of video games, YouTube
- **Child in African jungle (primitive tribe)**: Cannot have same thoughts
- The Delhi child has these thoughts because these things are part of his material reality

## Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism (98:26)

### Dialectical Materialism

- **MARXIST theory** is known as **dialectical materialism**
- HEGEL applied dialectical method to realm of ideas
- MARX applied dialectical method to realm of matter/material reality/economy

### Historical Materialism

- MARX applied the framework of dialectical materialism to understand changes taking place in human society through different periods of time
- **Historical Materialism = Dialectical Materialism** (same concept)
- **Definition**: How human society changes through different ages of historical time periods due to changes in the economy or material reality

## Marx's Theory of Historical Materialism - Definition (102:04)

### Formal Definition

- **MARXIST theory of historical materialism** explains the transformation of society through different historical epochs due to changes in the economy
- **Historical**: MARX traces the evolution of human society from one stage to the next
- **Materialist**: MARX considers that matter or material reality is the basis of any change
- **MARX interpreted social transformation in terms of changes in the material conditions of existence**

### Driving Force of Change

- **How do changes in economy/production system take place?**: Through improvements in production technology
- **Nature of Changes**: These changes are progressive (from MARXIST perspective)
- Society is moving toward establishment of an egalitarian society
- Production technology is improving with every historical epoch

### The Onward March of History

- **The onward march of history is progressive**
- **Due to improvements in production technology**, the society undergoes substantial changes
- **Final Stage**: Communist society (characterized by egalitarianism - all persons equal)

### Scientific Nature of the Theory

- **According to MARX and ENGELS**: Their theory of historical materialism is scientific and based on an exact description of the actual material conditions
- MARX and ENGELS saw themselves as scientists, not visionaries
- They picked up empirical evidence from different historical epochs of European history

## Economy as the Base of Society (112:06)

### Marx's Economic Focus

- **Economy is the base of the society**
- All other aspects of society (family, religion, law, political system, education) are based upon the economy
- **It is the needs of the economy which determine how other aspects of social life will be**
- All other social conditions are shaped by the economy

### Two Key Points

1. **Economy as Determinant**: How other things are determined by the economy
2. **Economy as Driver of Change**: As economy changes, there will be changes in other aspects of social life

### MARX's View of Human History

- **The whole of human history is an account of the development of new productive forces**
- Leading to changes in other aspects of social life as well
- **Driving Force**: Economy or production system
- **How Production System Changes**: Due to improvements in production technology

## Stages of Historical Development (116:53)

### Overview of Historical Epochs

Human society passes through various historical epochs according to MARX's theory:

| Stage                    | Main Classes              | Technology Level                       | Surplus             | Characteristics                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Primitive Communism   | None (classless)          | Very primitive tools                   | No surplus          | Small population, hunting-gathering, egalitarian |
| 2. Ancient Slave Society | Masters vs Slaves         | Agriculture discovered                 | Surplus starts      | First class society, private property emerges    |
| 3. Feudal Society        | Lords vs Serfs            | Advanced agriculture, inanimate energy | More surplus        | Continued class division                         |
| 4. Capitalist Society    | Factory Owners vs Workers | Machinery-based production             | Mass production     | Industrial Revolution                            |
| 5. Communist Society     | None (classless)          | Advanced technology                    | Abundant production | Egalitarian, no exploitation                     |

### Stage 1: Primitive Communism (117:34)

#### Characteristics

- **Earliest stage** of human social existence
- **Population**: Small sized
- **Technology**: Very primitive, very basic tools and implements
- **Economy**: Hunting-gathering kind of economy
- **Production**: Overall quantum of production was low
- **Consumption**: Whatever was produced was immediately consumed (no storage technologies)

#### Social Structure

- **No surplus** was being generated
- **All members** expected to participate in productive labor
- **No inequality**: Nobody could be richer than others (no accumulation possible)
- **Resource Ownership**: All resources owned by the whole community
- **Society Type**: Classless, egalitarian society
- **Characteristics**: Small-sized, simple, technologically backward, no surplus, classless

### Stage 2: Ancient Slave Society (123:12)

#### Technological Advancement

- **Key Innovation**: Discovery of agriculture (Neolithic Revolution)
- **Accompanied by**: Domestication of animals
- **Result**: Surplus starts getting generated

#### Social Changes

- **Private Property**: Notion of private property emerges for the first time
- **Question**: Whom does the surplus belong to?
- **Answer**: Some members claim exclusive right over surplus as their private property

#### Class Structure

- **First class society** that emerges
- **Emergence of leisure class**: Some people freed from necessity of productive labor
- **Two main classes**:
  - **Masters** (haves class)
  - **Slaves** (have nots class)

### Stage 3: Feudal Society (128:56)

#### Technological Progress

- **Key Advancement**: Man discovers ability to harness inanimate sources of energy (wind, water turbines)
- **Agricultural Technology**: Significant advancement in agricultural technology
- **Result**: More surplus being generated

#### Class Structure

- **Two main classes**:
  - **Feudal Lords** (haves)
  - **Serfs** (have nots)

### Stage 4: Capitalist Society (131:40)

#### Technological Revolution

- **Key Innovation**: Machinery-based production
- **System**: Mass production due to employment of machinery
- **Historical Context**: Industrial Revolution

#### Class Structure

- **Two main classes**:
  - **Factory Owners** (haves)
  - **Factory Workers** (have nots)

### Stage 5: Communist Society (133:39)

#### Characteristics

- **Resource Ownership**: All resources owned equally by all members of society
- **Society Type**: Classless, egalitarian society
- **Difference from Primitive Communism**: Both are communist but qualitatively very different
- **Progress**: Linear progressive, not circular
- **Exploitation**: No exploitation of man by fellow man

#### Comparison with Class Societies

- **Preceding three stages** (slave, feudal, capitalist) were class societies
- **Class societies marked by**: Exploitation, oppression of man by fellow man
- **Communist society**: Exploitation will be a thing of the past

## Nature of Class Relationships (150:53)

### Basic Relationship Characteristics

#### Exploitation and Oppression

- Relationship between haves and have nots is one of **oppressor and oppressed**
- **Exploiter and exploited**
- **Ruling class and ruled class**

#### Incompatible Class Interests

- **Class interests** of the two main classes are **mutually incompatible**
- Not just different, but incompatible
- **One class gains only at the expense of the other class**
- If one class gains, the other class loses

#### Example: Capitalist Society

- **Factory owners** want: Profit maximization
- **Factory workers** want: Higher and higher wages
- **Conflict**: If wages rise, they eat into profits; if profits increase, wages are depressed
- **Result**: Class interests are antagonistic and incompatible

### Continuous Class Conflict

- **Built into the system**: Continuous class conflict between haves and have nots
- **Reason**: Both trying to maximize their benefit or secure their class interest
- **Universal**: Occurs in every historical epoch

### Cooperation Element (157:14)

#### Relationship is Both Conflict and Cooperation

- Not only one of conflict or oppression
- **Also necessarily characterized by cooperation**
- **Relationship of both cooperation and conflict**

#### Why They Cooperate

- **Both classes are dependent on each other**
- **Must cooperate** in order to undertake production
- Haves and have nots cooperate, unite in order to undertake production

#### Unequal Dependence

- **Not a relationship of equal dependence**
- **Capitalist dependent on workers**: For undertaking production to increase profits
- **Worker dependent on capitalist**: For his very survival (living wage)
- **Dependence of have nots on haves**: Far more grave, far more consequential

### Antagonistic Cooperation (160:40)

- **Definition**: Relationship of **antagonistic cooperation**
- **Antagonism**: Conflict between classes with incompatible interests
- **Cooperation**: Unity in undertaking production
- **Application of Dialectical Law**: Law of unity and conflict of opposites at play
- **Realm**: In material reality/economy/production system, not ideas
