## ANSWER WRITING TECHNIQUES (19:10)

- **Question Type Analysis**: If the question is "evaluate DURKHEIM's theory of religion," you must mention criticisms as well
- **Elaboration Questions**: If the question says "elaborate DURKHEIM's theory of religion," then 80-90% of your answer body should be DURKHEIM's views and towards the end some portion you can devote to criticizing
- **Science Question Example**: "Is sociology a science? Give reasons for your answer"
  - You can conclude that it is in the nature of a science but different from the natural sciences
  - It's a social science or you can say that triangulation or methodological pluralism scientific as well as other methods being used
  - You must give the positivist and the anti-positivist view in the body
  - In conclusion, you don't have to your stance need not be either or
  - You must conclude definitively, but it need not be either or that you have to necessarily agree with the positivist or the antipositivist position

### Pre-Writing Framework Strategy

- **Before Writing**: Think out a framework and if possible jot it down in rough in the end of your question answer booklet
- **Time Investment**: Will take you say 30 to 50 seconds which seems expensive given that you have to write an answer within 7 to 8 minutes
- **Benefits**: It is time well spent and gives a much better structure and flow to your answer
- **Problem Without Framework**: You keep writing as things come to your mind and the answer becomes less presentable and more mixed up

### Additional Answer Writing Guidelines

- **Current Examples**: Give examples from current stuff in whichever topics you can
- **Paper Integration**: Don't draw an artificial divide between paper one and two. While writing answers feel very free to use the knowledge you acquire in one paper in the other
- **Question Reading**: Read the question a couple of times otherwise one tends to digress

- **Stated Grounds of Opposition**: The discipline doesn't offer anything new really
- **DURKHEIM's Response**: With this concept of social facts DURKHEIM was thus able to demarcate the distinctive subject matter of the new science of society

## RULES OF SOCIOLOGICAL METHOD (69:00)

### Rules for Observation of Social Facts

1. **Treat Social Facts as Things**: You the sociologist should treat your subject matter in the same way as the natural scientists treat their subject matter
   
   - As directly observable as empirical data
   - It must be quantified and measured
   - Empirical data must be collected and then processed using statistical techniques

2. **Clear Definition Required**: The sociologist must clearly define and delineate the phenomena being studied

3. **Discard Biases**: The sociologist must discard any preconceived notions that dominate the minds of ordinary men and adopt an emotionally neutral attitude while studying social facts

### Rules for Distinguishing Normal and Pathological Social Facts

- **Normal Social Fact**: One which is generally encountered in a society
- **Pathological Social Fact**: Any deviation from the standard is a pathological social fact

- **Crime as Normal**: A certain degree of crime is normal because there is no crime-free society. Crime exists in every known society
- **Functional Role of Crime**:
  - Crime is followed by punishment
  - When punishment is meted out to the criminal, it sends a message to the other members of the society that this kind of actions are not acceptable
  - Crime enables change in the society. The LGBT rights activists of today were criminals yesterday
- **Pathological Crime**: A very high degree of crime is pathological

### Rules for Classification of Social Facts

- **Scientific Method Context**: Since the scientific method of experimentation has limited application in Sociological research, sociologists may rely upon other scientific methods such as the comparative method
- **Purpose**: While studying the society in order to establish cause effect relationships
- **Classification Requirement**: Sociologists must do proper classification of the social phenomena into appropriate categories

### Rules for Explanation of Social Facts

1. **Avoid Teleology**: The causative factors of a social phenomena may be different from the functions which it performs
2. **Trace Social Facts to Other Social Facts**: Social facts cannot be explained by reducing them to any underlying biological, psychological or natural factors. Social facts can be explained only with reference to other social facts
