# Research Method and Analysis - Sociology Lecture Notes

## RECAP: DRAMATURGY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY (02:23)

- **DRAMATURGY**: Theory given by ERVING GOFFMAN
- **Core Concept**: Social life is compared to a drama or street play and theatrical performance in which we are performing different roles as actors literally

### Front Stage and Back Stage Concepts

- **Front Stage**: When we are performing our respective roles very consciously using props etc. in front of the audience, while doing so we are engaging in impression management
- **Back Stage**: When we remove our mask and be ourselves, stop using the props etc. and performing our character

### Theoretical Classification

- **Type**: Anti-positivist and interpretive sociology
- **Belongs to**: SYMBOLIC INTERACTIONISM theory

## ETHNOMETHODOLOGY (04:04)

- **Developed by**: GARFINKEL
- **Key Components**: Two important things - Indexicality and Reflexivity

### Core Concepts

- **Indexicality**: Things carry a certain meaning in a given context
- **Reflexivity**: People need a sense of order, therefore they seek it and in the process of conversation they create it
- **Literal Meaning**: The study of the methods that people employ to construct their social reality

## PHENOMENOLOGY (06:03)

- **Core Principle**: There is no objective social reality
- **Method**: People use classifications - the term we use is **Typifications**
- **Definition of Typifications**: Any concept is a typification
- **Purpose**: To make sense of their sensory experiences which are otherwise of all kinds of phenomena very weird

## POSITIVISM VS ANTI-POSITIVISM VS POST-POSITIVISM (07:08)

### Three Major Perspectives

| Perspective         | Core Argument                                                                                   | Application                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Positivism**      | You can study society using the scientific method - the same method used in natural sciences    | Supports scientific method for social sciences |
| **Anti-Positivism** | Denies the application and utility of the scientific method to study social reality/social life | Rejects scientific method for sociology        |
| **Post-Positivism** | Questions the utility of the scientific method in general, not just for sociological research   | Questions scientific method entirely           |

### Anti-Positivism vs Post-Positivism

- **Anti-Positivist Argument**: The nature of social life is very different from the natural world. People have hidden meanings which the scientific method cannot capture. Therefore, scientific method is not suitable for sociological research.

- **Post-Positivist Argument**: Questions the greatness of science and the scientific method itself. They question whether scientific method is good for anything - they question the utility of scientific method in general.

## KARL POPPER'S CRITIQUE OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD (11:23)

### The Swan Example

- **Scenario**: Observer visits pond daily, sees only white swans after extensive observation across multiple locations
- **Conclusion Drawn**: "All swans are white" (universal law based on finite observations)
- **Method Used**: Inductive empiricism - from finite observations to universal generalization

### POPPER'S Main Arguments

**Book**: "THE LOGIC OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY"

**Key Criticisms**:

1. **Any number of finite observations of a particular phenomena are not sufficient to formulate a universal generalization**

2. **Any such generalizations arrived at may be proved false by even a single observation to the contrary**

3. **All knowledge is at best tentative or provisional**

### Inductive vs Deductive Reasoning

| Method        | Process                                                | Example                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inductive** | From finite data points/observations → generalized law | Newton's observations → F=ma                             |
| **Deductive** | From established law → calculate specific values       | Using F=ma to find acceleration for given force and mass |

### POPPER'S Core Philosophy

- **Scientists should not be so sure** of their claims
- **Scientific method is logically inconsistent** - how can you arrive at universal generalization based on finite observations?
- **All knowledge should be tentative and provisional** rather than being presented as universal truths

## THOMAS KUHN'S PARADIGM THEORY (32:44)

### Book and Core Argument

**Book**: "THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS"

**Main Arguments**:

1. **Scientific knowledge is shaped by the prevailing paradigm**

2. **Scientific truths are regularly discarded with every paradigm shift and replaced by a new one**

3. **What is considered as scientific truth is determined by a consensus amongst the members of the scientific community of the day**

### Examples of Paradigm Shifts

- **Planets**: From 9 planets to 8 planets (Pluto reclassified)
- **Continents**: From 7 continents to 8 continents (recent addition)
- **Atomic Models**: Plum pudding model → Rutherford model → various subsequent models

### Scientific Knowledge Characteristics

- **Scientific knowledge changes** - not permanent universal truths
- **Previous scientific knowledge was true for that time**
- **Scientific knowledge advances not through evolution but through revolution** - previous set of scientific truths are discarded for new scientific truth

### Sociology's Status

- **Sociology is in a pre-paradigmatic stage** - no consensus regarding the nature of society
- **Different theoretical views** (Marxist, Functionalist, Symbolic Interactionist) are completely at odds with each other

## RESEARCH METHODS AND SAMPLING (46:39)

### Starting a Research Project

**Research Topic Example**: "Find out the relationship between education level and the incidence of poverty in Karol Bagh, Delhi"

**Starting Point**: Frame a hypothesis

### HYPOTHESIS (49:49)

**Definition**: A hypothesis is a tentative assumption or statement that clearly specifies a relationship between two or more variables under investigation

**Characteristics**:

- A proposed explanation which may be accepted or rejected after empirical testing
- Serves as the starting point of research
- Not taken to be true as an assumption - it's a matter of investigation and research

### Sources of Hypothesis

A hypothesis may be formed on the basis of:

- Intuition
- Common sense  
- Personal experience
- Anecdotal evidence
- Trial studies
- Imagination and observations

### Importance of Hypothesis

1. **Provides direction to the research effort**
2. **Helps the researcher to develop theory and eventually deepen understanding of the topic being researched**
3. **Crucial starting point that clearly identifies the relevant variables**
4. **Serves as a crucial link between empirical data and theory**
5. **Provides guidance/direction to the research endeavor**

### Characteristics of a Good Hypothesis

1. **Should have minimum number of variables (preferably two)**
2. **Should be relevant to the research topic**
3. **Should be simple and formulated in clear and precise terms**
4. **Should be empirically testable**

**Important Note**: Even if a hypothesis is proved wrong, it doesn't make it a bad hypothesis. It expands knowledge and furthers understanding of the topic.

## SAMPLING (74:00)

### Definition and Purpose

**Sampling**: Refers to the process of selection of a subset of elements from the total population in order to estimate the characteristics of the whole population

**Key Requirement**: The sample must be representative - it should as closely as possible replicate the composition of the total population

### Why Sampling?

- **Resource Constraints**: Helps save time and money
- **Practical Limitations**: Cannot study entire population due to limited resources
- **Convenience**: More manageable than studying entire population

### Types of Sampling

#### A. PROBABILITY SAMPLING

**Definition**: Every element of the population has an equal chance of being selected in the sample

**Types**:

1. **Random Sampling**
   
   - Every element in the sampling frame being assigned a number
   - Then some of those elements are arbitrarily selected into the sample

2. **Systematic Random Sampling**
   
   - Every nth element of the sampling frame is chosen into the sample
   - Example: Every 20th person from a list of 200 to select 10

3. **Stratified Random Sampling**
   
   - Total population is first divided into strata based upon some criteria
   - Then based upon the number of elements in each strata, proportionally elements are chosen from each strata in the sample
   - **Advantage**: More likely to yield a truer and more representative sample than simple random sampling

4. **Cluster or Multistage Sampling**
   
   - Used when the size of the population is large and its geographical spread is very wide
   - The total population may be divided into clusters
   - In the first stage, some clusters are selected using random sampling or systematic random sampling
   - Within each of the clusters, the population may be further divided into smaller clusters
   - In the second stage, some of these clusters are then randomly selected, and so on

#### B. NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING

**Definition**: Every element does not have an equal chance of being selected in the sample

**Types**:

1. **Convenience Sampling**
   
   - Elements chosen based on the researcher's convenience
   - Example: Surveying only your own students for research on online coaching satisfaction

2. **Volunteer Sampling**
   
   - Elements chosen based on them volunteering
   - May not be truly representative as certain types of people are more likely to volunteer

3. **Snowball Sampling**
   
   - Used when it is difficult for the researcher to access members of the population
   - Through references, you increase sample size
   - Example: Researching criminals - start with one known person, get references to others

4. **Quota Sampling**
   
   - The researcher fixes a quota that X number of elements in the sample should belong to a certain category
   - Different from stratified sampling as it's not proportional

## DATA COLLECTION METHODS (129:03)

### Various Techniques

- Questions/Questionnaires
- Interviews
- Observations
- Surveys
- Group discussions
- Case studies

**Note**: No single method is best under all circumstances. Choice depends on:

- Objective of the research
- Budget of the research
- Available resources and team size
- Size of the sample
- Type of information to be collected

## QUESTIONNAIRE (132:27)

### Definition

**Questionnaire**: A list of questions to which the respondent gives answers

### Types of Questions

| Type             | Description                                       | Advantages                                              | Disadvantages                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Closed-ended** | Respondent chooses from given answer choices      | Easily processable data, mathematical analysis possible | Less insight into respondent's mind            |
| **Open-ended**   | Respondent answers in own words in space provided | Deeper insight into respondent's mind                   | Difficult to process, no mathematical analysis |

### When to Use Each Type

- **Closed-ended**: Better for factual information
- **Open-ended**: Preferable for eliciting opinions and feelings

### Advantages of Questionnaires

1. **Can gather information from very large number of people at quite low cost**
2. **Offers immense convenience** - no coordination required between respondents and researcher
3. **Information can be collected anonymously** - useful for sensitive topics
4. **Do not require very huge manpower**
5. **Enhanced by online mode** - cheaper, faster

### Disadvantages of Questionnaires

1. **Response rate is typically very low**
2. **Responses are often non-serious and mechanical**
3. **No clarification possible** - respondents face lifeless piece of paper
4. **Researcher cannot probe deeper** - must accept responses at face value

### Precautions While Designing Questionnaire

1. **Questions should be relevant to the research problem**
2. **Should have adequate number of questions** - sufficient to capture all relevant information but not superfluous
3. **Should not contain repetitive or unnecessary questions**
4. **Should not bundle or club multiple questions together** - separate questions should be asked separately
5. **Questions should be in simple language** so that they are clearly and easily understood by respondents
6. **Should not contain any leading questions** - questions which elicit a particular response
