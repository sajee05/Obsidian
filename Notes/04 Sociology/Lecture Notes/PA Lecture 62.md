# Ambedkar's Views on Caste and Untouchability

## CASTE SYSTEMS ACROSS RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES (25:55)

### Caste Among Muslims

- **Muslim Caste Divisions**: There are two broad categories - ASHRAF and AJLAF
  - **ASHRAF**: High caste Muslims (example: SAYYADs)
  - **AJLAF/AJRAL**: Low ranking Muslims, lower than ASHRAF, like ex-untouchable Hindu castes

### Scholarly Studies on Caste Systems

- **Caste among Sikhs**: Studied by I.P. SINGH and S.S. JODHKA
- **Caste among Muslims**: Studied by IMTIAZ AHMAD and others
- **Caste outside India**: Studied by BERREMAN, primarily due to diaspora
- **Underclass in Japan**: BURAKU (not Buru) - untouchable type castes in their own system, not part of Indian diaspora

### Contemporary Evidence of Untouchability

- **PEW Research** (2021): Untouchability still exists today in contemporary times
- **THORAT's Research**: Highlighted discrimination and bias against scheduled castes in the education system
  - Lower literacy rates among scheduled castes
  - Discrimination has been invisibilized in places of higher education in modern India, but it's rampant though invisible

## AMBEDKAR'S THEORY OF CASTE GENESIS AND DEVELOPMENT (32:55)

### Ambedkar's Definition of Caste

- **Core Theory**: Outlined in his paper "CASTES IN INDIA - THEIR MECHANISM, GENESIS AND DEVELOPMENT"
- **Fundamental Concept**: Caste is an enclosed class
  - When a class becomes closed and prevents entry of outsiders, it becomes caste
  - Prevention mechanism operates through **endogamy**

### The Endogamy-Exogamy System

- **Indian Marriage Rules**: 
  - **Caste Endogamy**: Must marry within own caste
  - **Gotra Exogamy**: Must marry outside own gotra
- **Difficulty of Maintenance**: Endogamy is more difficult to maintain than exogamy because it's more restrictive of choice
- **AMBEDKAR'S Key Principle**: "Caste involves the imposition of endogamy on exogamy"

### For AMBEDKAR: Caste and Endogamy Relationship

- **Fundamental Equation**: Caste means endogamy; endogamy means caste - they are one and the same thing

### Maintaining Endogamy - The Numerical Parity Problem

- **Basic Requirement**: To maintain endogamy, every person must marry within the group
- **Essential Condition**: Society must ensure every man and every woman in a caste can find a marriage mate from within that group
- **Numerical Parity**: Equal number of men and women must be maintained in every caste
- **Natural Balance**: By nature, broad parity is maintained between genders
- **Disruption Factor**: Parity gets disturbed when a man or woman dies

### Solutions to Surplus Population Problems

| Problem                           | Traditional Solution                  | Reasoning                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Surplus Woman** (when man dies) | **Sati** - burning widow with husband | Eliminates extra woman, no numerical disruption                                          |
| **Surplus Woman** (alternative)   | **Enforced Widowhood**                | Make her unattractive through white clothes, no jewelry, seclusion from family functions |
| **Surplus Man** (when woman dies) | **Marrying young girls to older men** | Continuous supply of young girls from below, never-ending supply                         |

- **Why men aren't burned**: Society would lose a productive member, and according to AMBEDKAR, because he is a man

### Various Patriarchal Practices According to AMBEDKAR

- **Patriarchal practices** such as SATI, enforced widowhood, and marrying young girls to older men have emerged to ensure numerical parity between men and women, thereby ensuring that endogamy and caste can be maintained

## DEVELOPMENT OF CASTE AMONG LOWER CASTES (52:25)

### The Imitation Theory

- **AMBEDKAR's Position**: Caste system was NOT imposed by BRAHMINS on lower castes
- **Critique of MANU**: Though AMBEDKAR is critical of MANU (author of MANUSMRITI), he says caste system possibly existed far before MANU
- **MANU's Role**: MANU only codified what already existed in society

### Law of Imitation

- **How Lower Castes Developed Endogamy**: Through the **Law of Imitation**
- **Universal Principle**: The law of imitation is very powerful across societies - those below imitate those who are above
- **Voluntary Adoption**: Lower castes adopted endogamy by imitating higher castes
- **Relationship to Sanskritization**: Though AMBEDKAR didn't use the term "sanskritization," this concept is quite related and close in that sense

## ANNIHILATION OF CASTE - BACKGROUND AND CONTENT (55:50)

### Historical Background

- **JATPAT TODAK MANDAL**: Organization in Lahore (undivided India) in mid-1930s
  - Name meaning: Jatpat (caste), Todak (to break), Mandal (organization/platform)
  - Dedicated to breaking the caste system

### The Invitation and Controversy

- **Initial Refusal**: AMBEDKAR initially refused their invitation to preside over annual conference
- **Persistent Requests**: They sent a team from Lahore to Bombay to convince him
- **Acceptance**: AMBEDKAR eventually accepted to become president and deliver presidential address
- **The Conflict**: When AMBEDKAR sent his speech draft, organizers requested substantial changes
- **AMBEDKAR's Response**: "I will not change a comma. Either I will deliver the speech as it is or you are free to disinvite me"
- **Resolution**: Conference organizers canceled the conference that year
- **Publication**: AMBEDKAR published the undelivered speech as book "ANNIHILATION OF CASTE"

### Content of Annihilation of Caste

- **Two Main Sections**:
  1. Why the caste system must be destroyed
  2. How it can be destroyed

### Why Caste System Must Be Destroyed - AMBEDKAR's Critique

#### Irrationality and Unscientific Nature

- **Fundamental Flaw**: Caste system is completely irrational and unscientific
- **Arbitrary Assignment**: Without any basis, it assigns occupation to every member of society based on accident of birth, irrespective of person's abilities and aptitude

#### Economic Inefficiency

- **Economic Impact**: Caste system is greatly responsible for economic inefficiency
- **Merit-based Order**: It has prevented the rise of a merit-based social order in India
- **Example**: No matter how academically inclined, if born a SHUDRA, cannot teach; no matter how stupid, if son of BRAHMIN, can teach
- **Mismatch Problem**: No match between people's capabilities and what they are doing in society - the social role assigned to them

#### Unnecessary Restrictions

- **Restrictive Nature**: Caste system is unnecessarily restrictive
- **Web of Rules**: It binds every member in a cobweb of rules and regulations
- **Daily Life Control**: Controls eating, drinking, meeting, sitting, getting up - doesn't let people live freely
- **Numerous Restrictions**: Puts numerous unnecessary restrictions on its members

#### Not Just Division of Labor

- **Common Defense**: Some defended caste system arguing it's simply another form of division of labor
- **AMBEDKAR's Response**: "Caste system is not just a division of labor. It is a division of laborers"
- **Key Distinction**: It doesn't divide work, it divides society

#### Prevention of Nation Building

- **National Unity**: Caste system has prevented HINDUS from becoming a nation
- **Loyalty Issue**: A HINDU cannot think beyond his caste; his loyalty is to his caste
- **Individual Identity**: For a HINDU, his caste is his nation
- **Weakness**: Caste system has kept HINDU society weak and divided

#### Religious Unity Comparison

- **Other Religious Communities**: In other religious communities, religion unites and binds them
- **HINDUISM Exception**: HINDUISM divides because of caste system

#### Challenge to Civilization Claims

- **Greatness Claims**: Some harp on greatness of Indian civilization - continuous, unbroken civilization for thousands of years
- **AMBEDKAR's Counter**: Merely having survived is no sign of greatness
- **Survival Condition**: You have to see the condition in which you have survived
- **Historical Reality**: HINDU civilization has been regularly trampled upon, invaded, and plundered
- **Reason for Defeats**: Why continuously defeated? Because of divisions created by caste system

#### Tolerance Critique

- **Fabled Tolerance**: Challenges the supposed tolerance of HINDUS
- **AMBEDKAR's View**: HINDU is not tolerant; in many matters he is very intolerant
- **Caste Rigidity**: When it comes to caste and untouchability, HINDU is very rigid, very intolerant
- **Tolerance as Cowardice**: What you call tolerance is cowardice
- **Community Backing Example**: 
  - Muslim fights with full confidence because he has backing of all other Muslims
  - Sikh has full courage because he knows numerous others of his community will be mobilized
  - HINDU is always meek because he knows other HINDUS will not rise up on his call
  - HINDU's audience is only his caste; his affiliation is with only his caste

#### Untouchability as Worst Form of Indignity

- **Ultimate Evil**: Caste system is responsible for practice of untouchability
- **Worst Form**: Untouchability is the worst form of human indignity inflicted on man by fellow man
- **Comparison with Other Evils**: AMBEDKAR compares untouchability to:
  - Slavery in the US
  - Anti-Semitism in Europe (anti-Jewish sentiment culminating in Holocaust)
- **Worse than Slavery**: Untouchability is worse than slavery and anti-Semitism
- **No Escape**: Unlike slavery where there's hope of emancipation, there's no escaping untouchability
- **Permanent Stigma**: Once an untouchable, you will die with the stigma of untouchability
- **Degrading Nature**: Untouchability stings and degrades

#### Incompatibility with Democratic Ideals

- **Democratic Values**: Caste system is incompatible with democratic ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity

## HOW TO DESTROY CASTE SYSTEM - METHODS AND CRITIQUE (78:25)

### JATPAT TODAK MANDAL's Approach

- **Two-Pronged Strategy**:
  1. **Interdining** (intercaste dining)
  2. **Intermarriage** (intercaste marriage)

### AMBEDKAR's Assessment of Methods

#### Interdining

- **AMBEDKAR's View**: Interdining is NOT an effective way to end caste
- **Reason**: Some degree of interdining is already permissible
- **Limitation**: Does not strike at roots of caste system
- **Conclusion**: Will never be effective attack on caste system

#### Intermarriage

- **AMBEDKAR's View**: Intercaste marriages DO have potential to destroy caste
- **Reasoning**: Ties of blood are very strong; endogamy principle keeps caste system alive
- **Attack Strategy**: Once endogamy principle is struck, it can effectively strike a blow to caste system
- **Logical Connection**: Because marrying within caste creates strong caste consciousness, intercaste marriages can weaken this

### Problems with Popular Methods

- **Current Reality**: 95% marriages are within caste; in MP 99% are within caste; in Himachal 98%
- **People's Resistance**: People are not buying into intercaste marriages despite advocacy
- **Historical Ineffectiveness**: JATPAT TODAK MANDAL has been preaching for long but their cause is not popular

### Root Cause Analysis - Why Methods Fail

- **Cultural Inheritance**: Culture continues from before
- **Social Control**: It is because of social control
- **Family Influence**: People in families practice caste and untouchability
- **Religious Conditioning**: Even if grandmother was not evil person - devoted wife, doting mother, kind, pious religious lady - yet she practiced inhuman practice of untouchability and was committed to caste
- **Religious Teaching**: She does so because her religion tells her so

### AMBEDKAR's Radical Solution

- **Root Problem**: HINDU who practices caste and untouchability is not evil, but does so because his religion teaches him so
- **Necessary Action**: You have to tell the HINDU that the religious scriptures which teach caste and untouchability are wrong
- **Required Courage**: You should have the courage of a BUDDHA, of a NANAK to tell the HINDU that his DHARM SHASTRAS are wrong
- **Scripture Control**: HINDU DHARM SHASTRAS have very powerful control over HINDU mind
- **Mass Influence**: Bulk of HINDU population has not read the scriptures, yet they exert very powerful control because people believe in sanctity of scriptures

### The Dynamite Solution

- **AMBEDKAR's Declaration**: "You need to put dynamite to the VEDAS and DHARM SHASTRAS"
- **Religious Challenge**: You have to tell the HINDU that his religion is wrong
- **Only Path**: Only then can the caste system be annihilated
- **Historical Action**: AMBEDKAR personally supervised a public function of burning of MANUSMRITI

## AMBEDKAR'S CRITIQUE OF GANDHI AND CONGRESS (94:26)

### AMBEDKAR's Paper: "What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables"

#### Congress as Party of Governing Class

- **Class Character**: Congress is a party of the governing class
- **Composition**: Congress is a BANIYA-BRAHMIN party
- **BRAHMIN Dominance**: BRAHMINS have been governing class in India since ages and dominate Congress party

#### BRAHMINS as Worst Governing Class

- **AMBEDKAR's Assessment**: BRAHMINS are the worst kind of governing class any society can have
- **Hostility**: BRAHMINS have very active and clear hostility towards lower castes
- **Lack of Conscience**: BRAHMINS do not have a conscience
- **Historical Control**: To establish their authority, they have kept the governed classes (lower castes) in ignorance, denying them access to knowledge for centuries
- **Contrast**: In other societies, governing classes have made efforts for betterment of masses, but not so in India

#### BANIYAS as Parasitic Class

- **AMBEDKAR's Characterization**: BANIYAS are the worst parasitic class in human history
- **Greed**: Their greed for money is untampered by culture and conscience
- **Comparison**: BANIYAS are like undertakers - only difference is BANIYAS can create a pandemic to prosper (while undertakers only benefit from existing deaths)

### Electoral Strategy Critique

- **Candidate Selection Pattern**:
  - **General Seats**: Congress puts forth its best candidates (most educated, etc.)
  - **Reserved Seats**: If Congress fields an untouchable candidate, it chooses the worst of the lot
- **Administrative Impact**: Ensures administration and legislature is mostly filled by upper castes

### Gandhi's Position on Caste

- **Timeline Shift**: Until 1920, GANDHI used to criticize untouchability but defend caste system
- **Later Position**: After 1920, when defending caste system became untenable, he started criticizing caste system but defended VARNA VYAVASTHA

#### Gandhi's Defense of Caste System

- **GANDHI's Quotes**:
  - "Caste is an extension of principle of family - both governed by blood and heredity"
  - "From economic point of view, caste has ensured hereditary skill and limited competition"
  - "Caste is best remedy against heartless competition and social disintegration based on greed"
  - "Caste can be offered to the world as a heaven by India"

#### Gandhi's Praise of Caste Benefits

- **Competition Control**: Eliminates uncertainty about life direction - 12-year-old boys know their occupation
- **Poverty Prevention**: Caste system takes care of all sections of society
- **Social Stability**: Avoids cut-throat competition seen in modern society

### AMBEDKAR's Critique of Gandhi's Inconsistency

#### Personal vs. Preached Practice

- **GANDHI's Hypocrisy**: Defends caste system and VARNA VYAVASTHA but doesn't follow it himself
- **Occupational Deviation**: Born BANIYA (traditional calling: trade and commerce) but in politics (KSHATRIYA type) and claims to be MAHATMA
- **Inconsistency**: If birth-based social order is good, then practice it yourself

#### Language-Based Contradictions

- **Audience Tailoring**: GANDHI tailors arguments based on audience
- **English Writings**: More critical of caste system when writing in English papers
- **Gujarati Writings**: Defends caste system when writing in Gujarati for Gujarati audience

### AMBEDKAR vs. GANDHI on VARNA VYAVASTHA

#### GANDHI's VARNA Defense

- **VARNA Characteristics** (according to GANDHI):
  - VARNA is worth-based, not birth-based
  - VARNA are horizontal, not vertical (not hierarchical system)
  - No high and low in VARNA - all four are of divine origin
  - Nothing stops a BRAHMIN from serving his SHUDRA brother
  - No work is high or low

#### AMBEDKAR's Counter-Argument

- **Reality Check**: Forget what scriptures say or how MAHATMA interprets VARNA VYAVASTHA
- **People's Perception**: In people's minds, VARNA are vertical and birth-based
- **Terminology Impact**: BRAHMIN, KSHATRIYA, VAISHYA, SHUDRA - for people these are birth-based categories with BRAHMINS as superiors
- **Complete Rejection**: Not only caste system must be destroyed, VARNA VYAVASTHA must also go
- **Inseparability**: You cannot separate the two

### Social Background Influence on Views

- **AMBEDKAR's Background**: Came from MAHAR caste (untouchable caste in Maharashtra), personally experienced ignominy of untouchability
- **GANDHI's Background**: Came from BANIYA caste, very privileged upbringing, father was DEWAN (Prime Minister) of PORBANDAR state - born with silver spoon
- **Experience Difference**: AMBEDKAR had personally experienced untouchability while GANDHI never had that experience

### Scholarly Critiques of Gandhi

#### BHIKU PAREKH's Analysis

- **Leadership Control**: GANDHI's efforts against untouchability were attempt by high caste HINDUS to retain leadership of DALIT movement
- **Dependency Strategy**: Congress and GANDHI didn't want untouchables to take charge of their own emancipation; wanted them to remain passive and dependent
- **Leadership Positions**: Untouchables did not occupy leadership positions not only in Congress party but also in HARIJAN SEVAK SANGH - leadership was firmly in hands of upper castes

#### ELEANOR ZELIOT's Observation

- **Mentorship Pattern**: GANDHI nurtured large number of leaders (PATEL, NEHRU, AZAD) but never nurtured leadership among untouchables

### KANSHLRAM's Critique - The Chamcha Age

#### Background of KANSHLRAM

- **Professional Background**: Middle-class educated DALIT working in DRDO (government job)
- **Political Awakening**: Triggered by issue of holidays on birth anniversaries of DALIT icons being canceled while SHIVAJI birthday was declared holiday
- **Organization Formation**: First established DS4 (DALIT SHOSHIT SAMAJ SANGHARSH SAMITI), later transformed into BAHUJAN SAMAJ PARTY

#### The POONA PACT Critique

- **Book Title**: "CHAMCHA AGE" 
- **CHAMCHA Definition**: Someone who does yes-man behavior, buttering, sycophantic behavior
- **Target**: DALIT leaders are CHAMCHAS of upper castes
- **Historical Critique**: Criticizes GANDHI and Congress for forcing DALIT leadership led by AMBEDKAR to accept POONA PACT

#### POONA PACT Consequences

- **Original Award**: British had awarded separate electorates (only DALIT candidates and only DALIT voters in those constituencies)
- **GANDHI's Protest**: Went on fast unto death in protest
- **Forced Settlement**: DALIT leadership yielded - instead of separate electorates, settled for reserved constituencies (DALIT candidates but all persons voting)
- **Result**: Since POONA PACT, entire DALIT leadership that has emerged are CHAMCHAS - they are lackeys, yes-men of upper castes

#### The CHAMCHA System

- **Political Reality**: Main political parties' leadership is in upper caste hands
- **Electoral Dependency**: DALIT seeking election ticket must suck up to upper caste bosses in political party
- **Voter Mathematics**: In typical constituency, DALITs are 15% (numerical minority), 85% are touchable castes
- **Double Dependency**: Must cater to both upper caste party bosses and upper caste voters
- **Result**: DALITs themselves but cannot articulate DALIT interests

## DALIT MOVEMENT AFTER INDEPENDENCE (132:30)

### Constitutional and Legal Provisions

- **Constitutional Articles**: Articles 14 (equality), 15, 16, 164/154 (rights in public employment)
- **Protective Measures**: Various protective measures to secure SC/ST interests
- **Article 17**: Specific provision against untouchability
- **Articles 23-24**: Deal with BEGAR and child labor (indirectly benefiting SCs as worst sufferers)

### Institutional Framework

- **National Commission for Scheduled Castes**
- **National Commission for manual scavengers**
- **National SC Federation**: To promote finance among SC entrepreneurs
- **Scholarships and Freeships**
- **Reservation System**: In employment, education, and legislature at all three levels (Panchayat, State, National)

### Educational Emphasis

- **AMBEDKAR's Slogan**: "EDUCATE, ORGANIZE AND AGITATE"
- **Type of Education**: Modern education emphasized as emancipatory
- **Psychological Impact**: If even few untouchable caste doctors, engineers, educated persons exist in society, it instills confidence in whole community
- **Success**: Emergence of educated middle-class strata among DALITs providing leadership to DALIT movement

### DALIT LITERATURE MOVEMENT (1960s)

- **Historical Context**: Flight of DALITs highlighted since colonial period by writers like MUNSHI PREMCHAND
- **New Development**: 1960s saw development of DALIT literature by educated DALIT youth themselves
- **Characteristics**:
  - Semi-autobiographical
  - Written in regional languages (Marathi, Tamil, Telugu)
  - DALIT story in DALIT's own voice, not upper caste perspective

### Terminology Shift: HARIJAN to DALIT

- **DALIT Meaning**: Literally means broken, oppressed, crushed, completely scattered
- **Conscious Rejection**: Community consciously rejected GANDHI's term HARIJAN and preferred DALIT for self-identification
- **Reality Representation**: DALIT adequately captures their historical and contemporary social reality - society never treated them as children of God
- **Significance**: Signifies how untouchable castes have suffered from political, economic, and social subjugation

### Notable DALIT Writers

- **LAXMAN GAIKWAD**, **BABURAO BAGUL**, **NAMDEO DHASAL** - among leading writers

## POLITICAL EMPOWERMENT STRATEGIES (148:00)

### Main Political Agenda

- **Long-term Vision**: Abolition of caste system
- **Primary Goal**: Capture state power in DALIT hands
- **Reality Check**: DALIT presidents (K.R. NARAYANAN, RAMNATH KOVIND) achieved, but president is rubber stamp
- **Need**: Real power in policy-making, decision-making
- **Progress**: MAYAWATI as Chief Minister was step in that direction; next step is Prime Minister

### AMBEDKAR's Political Efforts

- **Multiple Attempts**: AMBEDKAR floated many political outfits
- **Personal Failure**: Despite being undisputed ideological leader of DALIT movement, politically he was a failure
- **Electoral Record**: Couldn't even win elections himself

### Limited Success: DALIT PANTHERS PARTY

- **Founder**: NAMDEO DHASAL
- **Achievement**: Met with some limited success in some parts of country
- **Outcome**: Eventually faded away, not long-term impactful engagement

### Most Successful Attempt: BAHUJAN SAMAJ PARTY (BSP)

- **Founder**: MANYAWAR KANSHIRAM
- **Strategy**: Social coalition approach rather than DALIT-only party

#### Coalition Mathematics

| Community   | Percentage                 | Strategy                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **SC**      | 15%                        | Core base                           |
| **ST**      | 8.2% (currently)           | Allied community                    |
| **Muslims** | ~14%                       | Strategic partner                   |
| **OBC**     | ~52% (according to MANDAL) | Largest component                   |
| **Total**   | ~85%                       | Majority against 15% forward castes |

#### KANSHIRAM's Vision

- **AMBEDKAR's Role**: Charted vision for DALIT movement including political aspect
- **KANSHIRAM's Contribution**: Created political roadmap for attainment of that vision
- **MAYAWATI's Achievement**: Realized that vision by becoming Chief Minister of most populous and caste-ridden state (Uttar Pradesh)
- **Historical Significance**: PM NARASIMHA RAO termed MAYAWATI becoming UP CM as "miracle of Indian democracy"

### BSP's Electoral Strategy Evolution

#### Initial Phase: Anti-Upper Caste Approach

- **Target Vote Base**: DALIT SHOSHIT SAMAJ
- **Slogan**: "Tilak Tarazu aur Talwar, inko maro joote char"
  - TILAK representing BRAHMIN
  - TARAZU representing BANIYA  
  - TALWAR representing RAJPUT
  - "Beat them with shoes"
- **Connecting Slogans**: "Kunwari hun, Chamari hun, tumhari hun"
  - "I am unmarried (dedicated to cause), I am CHAMAR (leather community), I am yours (one among you)"

## SYMBOLIC POLITICS AND REPRESENTATION (164:00)

### MAYAWATI's Symbolic Actions

- **Statue Building**: Went on statue-building spree, constructing life-size statues of DALIT ideologues like AMBEDKAR, KANSHIRAM, and MAYAWATI
- **Park Construction**: Built fancy, large-size parks with elephant statues (BSP symbol)
- **Lavish Celebrations**: Conducted lavish birthday parties wearing garlands of currency notes

### Critique vs. Defense of Symbolism

- **Critics' Argument**: Same money used for statues better spent on welfare through schools, hospitals
- **Counter-Argument**: Symbolism is important in public and social life

#### Importance of Symbols for DALIT Community

- **Need for Icons**: Every people, every community needs icons and heroes
- **Historical Absence**: DALITs previously didn't have any symbols, aspirational monuments in public life
- **Erased History**: As if they didn't have a glorious history

#### Symbolic Contrast in Statues

- **GANDHI Statues**: Show simplicity and poverty (dhoti-clad, thin stick, bare upper body)
- **AMBEDKAR Statues**: Show aspiration (suited-booted, three-piece suit, book in hand, Anglicized)
- **Aspirational Message**: AMBEDKAR came from untouchable community but represented educational success and empowerment

#### MAYAWATI's Symbolic Representation

- **Purse Symbol**: Statues show her with purse - symbol of economic empowerment
- **Ostentatious Display**: Expensive garlands, large birthday cakes to indicate "you have arrived," "you can also be moneyed"

### Scholarly Analysis of AMBEDKAR's Image

#### ELEANOR ZELIOT's Analysis

- **Empowering Image**: AMBEDKAR's image is empowering
- **Suit Symbolism**: Dressed in suit represents education, success, empowerment through relationship with government
- **Constitution Symbol**: Carrying constitution in one hand
- **Raised Hand**: Other hand is raised
- **Overall Message**: Each element is agent for the dalits

#### CHANDRABHAN PRASAD's Analysis

- **Historical Portrayal**: High castes have always portrayed DALITs as unclean and unhygienic
- **AMBEDKAR's Negation**: AMBEDKAR's image is negation of that stereotype

## RELIGIOUS CONVERSION STRATEGY (172:05)

### AMBEDKAR's Declaration (1930s)

- **Historic Statement**: "I was born a HINDU but I will not die a HINDU"
- **Public Intent**: Made public his intent to convert to another religion

### Courtship by Various Religions

- **Muslim Approach**: "Come to us, there's equality, QURAN is good"
- **Sikh Outreach**: Also courted AMBEDKAR
- **Christian Appeals**: Made their pitch
- **Stakes**: With AMBEDKAR, lakhs of his followers would convert; in democracy, numbers matter

### AMBEDKAR's Conversion Process

- **Timeline**: Took 20 years to decide
- **Final Decision**: Just before his death in 1956, converted to BUDDHISM
- **Mass Conversion**: 14th October 1956 in NAGPUR with 3 lakh followers, then 16th October in CHANDRAPUR with another 3 lakh followers
- **New Buddhism**: NEO-BUDDHISM or NAVYANA BUDDHISM (not Hinayana or Mahayana, but new vehicle)

### Critiques of Conversion Strategy

#### First Critique: All Religions Are Equal

- **Argument**: All religions have broadly same teachings - brotherhood, love, goodness, truth
- **Conclusion**: One should not abandon one religion in favor of another

#### Second Critique: Material Life Unchanged

- **Argument**: Even if person converts, it won't affect material life
- **Example**: If cleaning toilets as HINDU DALIT, will continue cleaning toilets after conversion - won't become king or trader
- **Conclusion**: Will bring about no change, no improvement in life of convert

### AMBEDKAR's Response to Critiques

#### Response to "All Religions Equal"

- **Dismissive Stance**: Very dismissive of this criticism
- **Key Argument**: All religions are NOT equal because they don't teach same things
- **Specific Critique**: Having thoroughly analyzed HINDUISM, reached decisive conclusion that HINDUISM is a bad religion
- **Evaluation Principle**: Each religion should be evaluated on merits of its teachings
- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - A religion teaches morality; HINDUISM teaches immorality
  - A religion unites; HINDUISM divides its own members and followers

#### Response to "Material Conditions Unchanged"

- **Acknowledgment**: Granted that economic position of convert will not improve
- **But Not Futile**: Conversion is not futile because it will have immense psychological impact
- **Psychological Benefits**: Will have immense psychological benefit
- **Inferiority Complex Removal**: Will remove the inferiority complex that untouchables suffer from in HINDUISM
- **Community Membership**: They will become members of a community (currently excluded from society)
- **Psychological Well-being**: Essential for psychological well-being

### The Conversion Event and Its Significance

- **Sacred Text**: AMBEDKAR outlined reasons for choosing BUDDHISM in book "BUDDHA AND HIS DHAMMA"
- **Religious Status**: One of most sacred books for NEO-BUDDHISTS
- **Worship Pattern**: In NEO-BUDDHIST homes, two figures are worshipped - GAUTAM BUDDHA and B.R. AMBEDKAR
- **Irony**: AMBEDKAR was against hero worship and devotee culture in Indian politics but ironically became one of the gods in NEO-BUDDHIST movement
- **Annual Ritual**: Every year, many people repeat conversion at DEEKSHA BHOOMI

|                                | Endogamy-Exogamy System   | • Caste endogamy (marry within caste) • Gotra exogamy (marry outside gotra)                                        |
|                                | Core Principle            | • "Caste means endogamy; endogamy means caste" • Imposition of endogamy on exogamy                                 |
|                                | Numerical Parity Problem  | • Equal men-women needed in each caste • Disrupted by death creating surplus                                       |
|                                | Solutions to Surplus      | • Surplus women: SATI, enforced widowhood • Surplus men: marry young girls to older men                            |

|                                |                           | • Division of laborers, not labor • Prevents nation-building • Creates weakness through division                   |

|                                | Methods Analysis          | • Interdining: ineffective • Intermarriage: potentially effective but unpopular                                    |
|                                | Root Solution             | • Attack religious scriptures • "Put dynamite to VEDAS and DHARM SHASTRAS" • Challenge sanctity of religious texts |

|                                | GANDHI's Caste Position   | • Defended caste system until 1920 • Later defended VARNA VYAVASTHA • Inconsistent practice vs preaching           |
|                                | GANDHI's VARNA Defense    | • Worth-based not birth-based • Horizontal not hierarchical • All divine origin                                    |
|                                | AMBEDKAR's Counter        | • VARNA are birth-based in people's minds • VARNA system must also go • Cannot separate from caste                 |
