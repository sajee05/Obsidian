## Current State of Indian Agriculture and Indian Farmers (30:27)

### Positive Aspects - India as Agricultural Powerhouse

- **Food Security Achievement**: No famines in recent decades, transition from food shortage to surplus
- **Global Production Rankings**:
  - **Largest producer**: Milk, silk, jute, pulses
  - **Second largest producer**: Rice, wheat, cashew nuts, groundnuts, fruits & vegetables, sugarcane, tea, cotton, eggs, tobacco

### Agricultural Revolutions in India

- **Green Revolution**: Cereals production
- **White Revolution**: Milk production  
- **Blue Revolution**: Fish production
- **Pink Revolution**: Meat/onion production
- **Yellow Revolution**: Oilseeds production
- **Grey Revolution**: Fertilizer production

### Government Support Systems

- **Subsidized Inputs**: Power, water, fertilizers provided free or subsidized
- **Cheap Credit**: Available through institutional sources
- **Assured Market**: Minimum Support Price (MSP) system
- **Tax-free Income**: Agricultural income exempt from taxation

### Agricultural Statistics

- **Employment**: 55% of India's workforce employed in agriculture and allied sectors
- **Research Infrastructure**: One of the world's largest agricultural research systems (ICAR and State Agricultural Universities)

## Agrarian Unrest and Crisis (69:27)

### Manifestations of Agricultural Crisis

- **Farmer Suicides**: Widespread occurrence across different states
- **Agitations**: Against government policies like farm bills
- **Protests**: Demanding loan waivers and better support prices
- **Migration**: From rural to urban areas

### Reasons for Agricultural Stagnation

1. **Low Growth Rate**: Agricultural growth rate around 2.5% per annum (compared to overall GDP growth of 7.5%)

2. **Declining GDP Share**: Agriculture's share in GDP declined from 50% at independence to 15-20% today, while still supporting 55% of population

3. **Monsoon Dependence**: 55% of net cultivated area still rain-fed

4. **Excessive State Dependence**: Heavy reliance on government for technology, irrigation, credit, MSP

5. **State Withdrawal**: With globalization, state support has become hesitant due to pressure to reduce farm subsidies

### Low Income Levels

- **Average Monthly Household Income**: ₹10,218 for agricultural households
- **Per Capita Income**: ₹2,000 per month (with average household size of 5)
- **Income from Cultivation**: Only 37% of total household income
- **Other Income Sources**: 40% from wages and salaries, rest from livestock and non-farm activities

### Indebtedness Problem

- **Percentage Indebted**: 50% of all agricultural households
- **Average Outstanding Loan**: ₹74,121 per household
- **Informal Sources**: 20% of loans still from money lenders
- **Loan Purpose**: Only 55% for agricultural purposes, rest for consumption (marriage, health expenses)

### Land Fragmentation

- **Unviable Holdings**: 85% farmers have small and marginal holdings (less than 2 hectares)
- **Fragmentation Process**: Land gets divided with each generation, making holdings economically unviable
- **Impact**: Reduced productivity and increased per-unit cultivation costs

### Rising Aspirations vs Stagnant Income

- **Material Aspirations**: Increased due to globalization and advertising
- **Income Stagnation**: Farm incomes not rising proportionally
- **Consumption Loans**: Leading to debt for non-productive purposes

## Agricultural Distress Factors According to P. SAINATH (95:11)

1. **Lack of Access to Institutional Credit**
2. **Incomplete Land Reforms** 
3. **Non-availability of Irrigation Facilities**
4. **Subordination of Farmers to Market Forces**
5. **Lack of Adequate Non-agricultural Sources of Income**
6. **Intermediary Exploitation**: Middle-men taking large margins from farmers' produce

## Feminization of Agriculture (98:10)

### Causes of Feminization

- **Male Migration**: Men shifting to urban areas for better opportunities
- **Economic Necessity**: Village economy becoming less attractive for men
- **Gender Division**: Women filling vacuum created by male out-migration

### Positive Aspects

- **Economic Contribution**: Women's economic participation increases from nil to significant levels
- **Resource Optimization**: Frees men for more productive jobs in industry/urban areas
- **Family Income**: Contributes to overall family financial health

### Negative Aspects

- **Double Burden**: Women continue traditional roles plus farm work
- **Child Labor**: Increase in child labor as children accompany working mothers
- **Land Ownership**: Women not in ownership capacity, continue patriarchal constraints
- **Invisibilization**: Women's work less recognized and valued than men's
- **Technology Gap**: Agricultural tools not women-friendly

## Policy Recommendations - DALWAI COMMITTEE (104:24)

### Paradigm Shift

- **From Production Focus to Income Focus**: Shifting emphasis from agricultural production to enhancing farmers' income

### Income Formula

**Income = (Price of Output × Quantity of Output) - (Price of Input × Quantity of Input)**

- Need to work on all four variables, not just output quantity

### Key Recommendations

1. **Tailored Approach**: No one-size-fits-all approach for different categories of farmers
2. **Crop Diversification**: Greater focus on horticultural products and livestock, particularly **MILLETS**
3. **Technology Infusion**: Enhanced use of HYV seeds and resource conservation technologies like drip irrigation
4. **Investment Enhancement**: Both public and private sector investment through incentivizing private participation
5. **Market Access**: Improved farmer access to markets

### Government Schemes

- **PM FASAL BIMA YOJANA**: Crop insurance scheme
- **PM KRISHI SINCHAYEE YOJANA**: Irrigation development
- **SOIL HEALTH CARD SCHEME**: Soil testing and nutrient management
- **e-NAM**: Electronic National Agriculture Market
- **PM KISAN VIKAS YOJANA**: Farmer development scheme

## Peasant and Farmer Movements (120:43)

### Distinction Between Peasants and Farmers

**A.R. DESAI's Definition:**

- **Peasants**: Small landholders engaged in subsistence agriculture (pre-capitalist mode)
- **Farmers**: Large landholders engaged in commercial/capitalist agriculture for profit

### Academic Evolution

- **1950s-60s**: Peasant movements received little academic attention due to:
  
  - Dominance of Gandhian view of villages as seats of harmony
  - Structural-functional approach emphasizing cooperation

- **1970s onwards**: Shift to AMBEDKAR's view of villages as seats of exploitation and oppression

- **NAXALBARI UPRISING**: Forced researchers to take notice of peasant unrest

### Colonial Period Peasant Movements

**Economic Factors (DHANAGARE's Analysis):**

- Exploitative land tenure systems
- High taxes imposed on peasantry
- Breakdown of Jajmani system
- Summary eviction of tenants without notice
- Excess pressure on land due to population increase
- Landlords not interested in land improvement
- Low agricultural productivity
- Frequent famines and price rises
- Landlessness and pauperization of Indian peasantry

**Major Movements:**

- PABNA AGRARIAN LEAGUE
- EKA MOVEMENT  
- KISAN SABHA MOVEMENT
- BARDOLI SATYAGRAHA
- KHEDA SATYAGRAHA

## Analysis of Farm Bill Protests (161:02)

### Punjab's Agricultural Context

**Green Revolution Success:**

- Punjab with only **1.5% of geographical area** and **2.2% of population**
- Contributed **30-50% of total rice production** and **50-75% of wheat production** between 1980-2010

### Changing Agricultural Dynamics

- **By 1990**: Agriculture's GDP share began declining rapidly
- **Political Relevance**: Farmers' political influence also started declining  
- **21st Century**: Agriculture no longer viewed as favorable occupation in Punjab

### Farmer Perspective on Laws (SURINDER JODHKA's Analysis)

- **Priority Concern**: Laws represented state prioritizing corporate interests over farmers
- **Identity Attack**: Not just livelihood assault but attack on Punjabi farmer identity and culture
- **Cultural Significance**: Kisan identity very dear to Punjabis as hardworking, industrious people
- **Status Reduction**: Laws would reduce them from enterprising farmers to wage laborers

### Leadership and Sustainability

- **Dominant Participation**: Led mainly by **JAT SIKH** community
- **Resource Availability**: Prosperous farmers had necessary resources to sustain long-term movement
- **Economic Capacity**: Could maintain protest for extended periods due to financial strength

### Academic Perspectives

**PARMJIT SINGH JUDGE:**

- Laws faced opposition due to lack of consultation with main stakeholders (farmers)
- Fear of MSP regime dismantling

**NIVEDHITA MENON:**

- Despite patriarchal society, women farmers led from the front

**NIRA CHANDHOKE:**

- Government tried to delegitimize legitimate movement by branding protesters as:
  - Khalistanis
  - Pakistanis  
  - Anti-nationals
  - Andolanjivis (professional protesters)

**ASHIS NANDY:**

- Protests showcase that Indians are not passive citizens
- In Indian democracy, people's will eventually prevails regardless of charismatic leadership
