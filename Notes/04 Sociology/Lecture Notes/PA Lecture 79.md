# Working Class in India

## INDUSTRIAL CLASS STRUCTURE AND CAPITALIST CLASS (00:01)

- The Indian capitalist class had a very narrow base during the colonial period
- **Narrow Base**: Confined to traditional trading castes and communities such as BANIYAS
- Even during the NEHRU planned economy period, it remained narrow due to the license permit quota raj
- According to **HARISH DAMODARAN** in "India's New Capitalists": The capitalist class has diversified and broadened its social base in contemporary India

### Composition of Working Class

- **SHARIT BHAUMIK** in "Industry, Labor and Society" points out that the composition of the working class in India represents or captures the diversity present in Indian society
- Its members are drawn from:
  - Various castes and communities
  - Both men and women  
  - Child labor, adults and the elderly
  - Different religious communities
  - Various linguistic groups
  - Different regions and ethnic profiles
  - Different sectors of the economy (heavy industry, mining, construction sites)
  - Various categories or scales of enterprise spread across small and micro enterprises, medium enterprises, large scale corporates
  - Both rural and urban areas
  - Both formal and informal sectors

## MIDDLE CLASS: OLD VS NEW (03:00)

### Traditional Middle Class Characteristics

- **Educated**: Connected to modern education systems
- **Mobile**: Geographically mobile due to employment opportunities
- **Heterogeneous**: Diverse in composition
- **Traditional and Modern**: In transition between traditional and modern values
- **Rural and Urban**: Present in both areas
- **Substantially Rural**: According to some scholars, Indian middle class is also substantially rural

### New Middle Class (Post-1991)

- **1991 Reforms**: Old middle class was transformed to a new middle class
- **White Collar Occupations**: Emergence of doctors, engineers during colonial period, but expansion during globalization
- **LEELA FERNANDES**: Has written extensively about this new middle class using the specific phrase "new middle class"
- **Consumerist Nature**: Unlike the older middle class, the new middle class is very consumerist - in stark contrast to the older middle class

### Political and Administrative Role

- **During Freedom Struggle**: Middle class was at the forefront of the national freedom struggle
- **After Independence**: Middle class kind of moved away from politics and administration due to new leadership
- **Generational Shift**: When generational shift took place in the second half of the 1960s, middle class moved away from nation building
- **Post-1990s**: Started playing a more decisive role in Indian politics, particularly 2014 and 2019 general elections
- **Civil Society Movements**: Also by participating in large numbers in civil society movements

## NATURE OF INDIAN WORKING CLASS (12:00)

### Basic Characteristics

- **Day-to-day Survival**: Have to worry about day-to-day survival and day-to-day earnings
- **No Cushion**: Don't have a cushion or anything to fall back on
- **Next Meal Dependency**: Their next meal is determined/dependent on what they do today
- **Manual Labor**: They sell their manual labor in the market and rely upon their manual labor
- **Vicious Cycle of Poverty**: Even since the RTE ACT (Right to Education Act), there is vast illiteracy
- **Child Labor Issues**: Lot of working class children may be compelled to leave their jobs midway to sell their manual labor in the market

### Personal Experiences and Examples

- **Fishing Workers**: Some students mentioned their uncles are in fishing
- **Factory Workers**: Example of a worker in a village working in a factory in LUDHIANA who was compelled to sell his land due to illness to make money available for medical treatment
- **Debt Trap**: Workers trapped in debt cycle, paying interest at 40% per annum, where interest payments increase the principal amount
- **COVID Migration**: During COVID, witnessed workers migrating back to villages, traveling on foot from BOMBAY to UTTAR PRADESH villages

### Caste and Working Class Relations

- **Cross-Caste Composition**: Working class in India are drawn from across castes including traditional high castes
- **Substantial OBC Representation**: Numerically significant chunk will be OBCs, SCs also, STs also
- **Network Recruitment**: According to **N.R. SHETH**, caste and kinship networks are used for hiring workers
- **Accountability Mechanism**: This helps in ensuring greater productivity and commitment of new workers - if new worker doesn't perform, it reflects poorly on the previous worker who helped recruit

## FORMAL VS INFORMAL WORKERS IN INDIAN ECONOMY (28:00)

### Definitions

- **Informal Sector/Unorganized Sector**: Small scale enterprises defined as those which have less than 10 workers
- **Informal Workers**: Those workers who do not have job security and social security
- **Formal Workers**: Those who have job security and social security

### National Commission for Enterprises in Unorganized Sector

- **Headed by**: ARJUN SEN GUPTA
- **Definition**: The unorganized sector comprises of various unincorporated enterprises whether owned by individuals, partnerships and households which employ less than 10 persons

### Four Types of Workers

1. **Formal workers in the organized sector**
2. **Informal workers in the organized sector** 
3. **Formal workers in the unorganized sector**
4. **Informal workers in the unorganized sector** (most numerous)

### Statistical Overview (Economic Survey 2020)

| Type of Employment | Organized Sector | Unorganized Sector | Total |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| Formal Workers     | 5.09             | 0.80               | 5.89  |
| Informal Workers   | 4.46             | 43.19              | 47.64 |
| Total              | 9.55             | 43.99              | 53.53 |

**Key Observations:**

- Total Indian work force: approximately 55 crores
- Almost the entire work force in the unorganized sector is of informal workers (43.1 out of 43.9)
- About 80% of total employment is in the unorganized sector
- Overwhelming dominance of informal workers in the unorganized sector

### Policy Implications

- **ARJUN SEN GUPTA Committee**: Suggested that too much policy attention is paid to the organized sector
- **Policy Shift Needed**: Should shift policy focus away from obsessing with the formal sector and onto the unorganized sector where bulk of employment is getting generated

### Informalization in Organized Sector

- According to **NCEUS** (National Commission for Enterprises in Unorganized Sector): During this period of globalization, the informalization of the work force in the organized sector is on the rise
- **Contracting Out**: Big corporates hire labor contractors who then supply bonded labor, circumventing legal obligations
- **Rising Trend**: This kind of contractual labor being hired by formal sector corporates is on the rise

## SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF LARGE INFORMAL WORK FORCE (43:00)

### Job Security Issues

- **Lack of Job Security**: Continuation in employment is not as per any written enforceable contract but dependent on personal equation with employer
- **Dismissal Based on Mood**: Informal workers are often dismissed based on mood swings of the boss
- **Unstable Income Source**: Very tenuous and unstable source of income

### Social Security Deficits

- **No Retirement Concept**: Large number of people (47 crore workers) are without any social security, meaning they will continue to work well into their old age
- **Continued Family Dependence**: This large work force continues to be dependent on the family as a support system
- **Traditional Structures**: Traditional social structures like family, community, village community, caste etc. come in handy as a source of social security

### Vulnerability and Exploitation

- **More Vulnerable**: This large work force is more vulnerable to exploitation by employers
- **Hardly Any Bargaining Power**: They have very limited negotiating strength
- **Low Productivity**: Large work force suffers from low levels of productivity - productivity in informal sector is largely much lesser than that in formal sector
- **Training Deficits**: Unlike formal workers who get training and skills upgradation investment from employers, informal workers don't receive such investment

### Legislative Exclusion

- **Pro-Worker Legislation**: This large work force is mostly unable to benefit from pro-worker legislation
- **Formal Worker Benefits**: Most pro-worker legislative framework benefits mainly formal workers
- **Recent Attempts**: Recently there have been attempts to extend benefits of legislation and government policy through ESHRAM PORTAL for registering informal workers

### Trade Union Neglect

- **Deprived of Collective Bargaining**: This large chunk of work force has been mostly deprived of the strength of collective bargaining
- **Trade Union Focus**: Trade unions also do not focus on and represent the informal workers - they don't raise the issues of informal workers
- **Dispersed Nature**: Informal workers are dispersed in small units, making trade union organization difficult

## CASTE AND INDUSTRIAL WORK FORCE (51:00)

### Traditional vs Modern Industry Views

**CLARK KERR's Perspective:**

- Modern industry requires **committed labor**
- **Committed Labor Definition**: Labor or working class which is committed to the industrial way of life whose lifestyle, ethos, mindset is in sync with the needs of industrialization
- **Characteristics of Committed Labor**: 
  - Mobile geographically - will go wherever needs and job opportunities arise
  - Will seek higher pay
  - Devoted to their work
  - Behaves as per the needs of an industrial economy

**Traditional Structures as Hindrance:**

- In developing societies like India, traditional social structures of caste, kinship etc. have prevented the development of a committed labor force
- Traditional social structures like caste and kinship have prevented the emergence of committed labor in India
- These traditional structures keep the work force tied to the home base
- **Examples**: Workers want long leave to go back to village during harvest, festivals, family events
- This is not the sign of a committed labor force - being caught between two different worlds: feudal traditional society and modern industrial society
- Traditional structures like caste, kinship etc. are detrimental to industrialization - they are a hindrance to industrialization

### Alternative Research Findings

**Studies by N.R. SHETH and R.D. LAMBERT:**

- Their study suggested that Indian workers are more committed than their European counterparts
- **LAMBERT's Study**: Studied workers in PUNE factories and found that the attitude of workers, thanks to traditional structures, workers treated their employers like JAJMANS
- Workers were not driven purely and solely by monetary motive
- They felt a sense of obligation to serve their employers/JAJMANS to the best of their capacity

**Benefits of Traditional Networks:**

- **SHETH's Findings**: Caste and kinship networks are used for hiring workers and come in very handy for hiring of workers
- **Recruitment Process**: Existing workers are told to bring their caste and kinsmen from villages when more workers are needed
- **Accountability**: Since new workers are recruited through this network, it helps to hold them accountable - if new worker doesn't perform well, it reflects poorly on the recruiting worker

## WORKING CLASS VS MIDDLE CLASS DISTINCTIONS (62:00)

### Traditional Clear Distinctions

**At Independence (ANDRE BETEILLE's Analysis):**

- India had a small sized middle class which was clearly distinguishable from the small working class
- **Separate Neighborhoods**: Different residential areas
- **Income Levels**: Clear income differences  
- **Education Emphasis**: Middle class emphasized education, working class did not
- **Job Nature**: Working class engaged in manual/blue collar jobs, middle class in non-manual white collar jobs
- **Standard of Living**: Clear differences in living standards

### Contemporary Blurring of Boundaries

**Post-Independence Changes:**

- As industrialization has proceeded, both classes have expanded considerably
- The earlier clear distinction between the two doesn't hold true anymore
- The line between them is becoming increasingly hazy

**Reasons for Convergence:**

- **Income Levels**: Lower middle class and better paid working class income levels are converging
- **Education Expansion**: Massive emphasis by Indian state on spread of education - even working class are very conscious of ensuring good education for their children
- **Residential Patterns**: Many lower middle class and middle-middle class people reside in urban slums in expensive places like DELHI and MUMBAI

### Current Scenario

- Today it is becoming difficult to distinguish between them clearly
- Cannot make a very water tight compartmentalization between the two classes
- With expansion of education and opportunities for social mobility, a large chunk of workers or working class are enjoying what were earlier regarded as middle class standard of living

## IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION ON INDIAN WORK FORCE (74:00)

### Pre-Reform Context (Before 1991)

- **Socialist Orientation**: The pre-reforms independent Indian state had a clear socialist orientation
- **Stated Objectives**: 
  - Prevent concentration of wealth
  - Develop a socialistic pattern of society  
  - Secure the rights of workers
- **Pro-Worker Legislation**: Developed a very robust framework of pro-worker legislation covering various aspects:
  - Minimum wage legislation
  - Regulation of hours of work
  - Maternity benefits
  - Safety and security in industrial workplace
  - Social security benefits

### State as Model Employer

- **Mixed Economy**: Public sector was expected to occupy the commanding heights of the economy
- **PSUs as Major Employers**: Public Sector Undertakings were not just major employers, they were expected to be model employers
- **Model Employer Characteristics**:
  - Income differential between topmost and lowermost positions not too high
  - Lowest level could afford a very decent standard of living
  - Not driven solely by profit motive but also by socialist orientation to generate employment

### Post-Liberalization Changes

**According to VISHWAJIT GHOSH**: Globalization poses serious challenges for the Indian working class - it significantly affects their interests, their composition and their mobilization

### Negative Impacts of Globalization

1. **Privatization Effects**:
   
   - PSUs were privatized
   - Change of ownership from public to private hands
   - Often followed by mass lay-offs
   - Private companies want slim and trim work force (right-sizing, not downsizing)

2. **Dispute Resolution Changes**:
   
   - **Earlier Tripartite System**: Involved three parties - trade union representatives, management representatives, and state representatives
   - **Current Bipartite System**: State's role has been eliminated - workers directly confronted with stronger adversary
   - State used to bend towards workers in negotiations

3. **Informalization of Organized Sector**:
   
   - Increasing trend of hiring contractual labor by formal sector corporates
   - Almost half of work force in organized sector is informal workers without job security and social security
   - **NCEUS Finding**: Informalization of workers in formal/organized sector is on the rise

4. **Jobless Growth**:
   
   - Economy is growing at fast rate but job creation is not keeping pace
   - As many jobs are not being created despite higher growth trajectory

5. **Labor Law Relaxation**:
   
   - Increasing emphasis on relaxing labor laws
   - MODI government brought four labor codes
   - Steps being taken to dismantle pro-worker legislative framework established by socialist Indian state

6. **Skill Upgradation Requirements**:
   
   - Indian workers need to continuously upgrade their skill sets due to introduction of newer technologies

7. **Global Competition**:
   
   - Indian workers today are competing with workers globally
   - Companies will look at profile of workforce when deciding to invest in India

8. **Feminization of Work Force**:
   
   - **GHOSH Points Out**: In several industries there is feminization of the work force
   - Mass replacement of permanent male workers by casual female workers
   - Women workers are seen as being paid lesser, more compliant, more docile, more easily subject to exploitation

9. **International Migration Increase**:
   
   - Increase in pace of international migration of Indian work force
   - Large number of Indian workers working in Gulf (began in 1970s)
   - In some Gulf city states, Indian population is more than native population
   - Workers send back substantial chunk of incomes as remittances, adding to forex kitty

### Positive Impacts of Globalization

1. **Greater Employment Opportunities**: Some argue that lot of jobs have been created

2. **State Capacity Enhancement**: State now has more money to spend on workers due to economic growth

3. **Child Rights Focus**: Increased focus on rights of child due to international attention
   
   - **Child Labor Reduction**: Incidence of child labor has reduced
   - **International Framework**: International labor rights regime as outlined by ILO conventions
   - **Right to Education**: Made a fundamental right in this era
   - **KAILASH SATYARTHI**: Won Nobel Peace Prize highlighting defense of the issue
   - **RTE Act**: Right to Education Act passed

4. **International Labor Standards**: International focus on labor rights in ILO conventions and WTO negotiations compelling industrialists to have more worker-friendly working environment

5. **Pressure for Better Conditions**: Compelling to remove sweat shops and provide better work conditions

### Political Consensus Challenge

- **Broad Political Consensus**: There is very broad consensus on political consensus on direction of economic reforms
- **Cross-Party Support**: Whether left wing, right wing, center, Congress, BJP - liberalization of economy is being carried further ahead
- **Trade Union Impact**: Since major trade unions are politically aligned and all parties support globalization, it becomes difficult for trade unions to oppose any anti-worker measures
- **Muted Criticism**: Political alignment between trade unions and parent political party mutes their criticism

## FOUR LABOR CODES (110:00)

### Background and Rationale

- **MODI Government Initiative**: Four labor codes brought out by MODI government
- **Simplification Goal**: Replace excessive legislation with four modern updated codes
- **Previous Complexity**: Earlier had large number of labor laws at central level and various state government levels
- **Multiple Definitions**: Term 'wage' was defined differently in different labor laws - codes provide single definition

### The Four Codes

1. **Labor Code on Industrial Relations**
2. **Labor Code on Wages** 
3. **Labor Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Work Conditions**
4. **Labor Code on Social Security**

### Key Features and Updates

- **Minimum Wage**: Can be defined as per occupational category and as per place of employment (different for MUMBAI vs non-descript town)
- **Women Workers**: Can now work beyond traditionally restricted hours (after 7:00 PM and before 6:00 AM)
- **Unorganized Workers**: Extended social security benefits to unorganized workers and gig workers
- **Modern Relevance**: Take into account contemporary reality and cover various aspects

### Government's Claims

- **Simplified Framework**: Simplify the cobweb of labor legislation
- **Boost Productivity**: Will boost industrial productivity  
- **Investment Attraction**: Will make India more attractive as an investment destination
- **Ease of Doing Business**: Will improve the ease of doing business
- **New Worker Categories**: Will benefit new categories of workers not covered earlier - informal workers, agricultural workers, gig workers
- **Path Breaking**: Government considers these as path breaking reforms

### Criticism by K.R. SHYAM SUNDAR

**"Labor Codes are a Disaster":**

- On pretext of improving ease of doing business, government is pushing back industrial relations into dark days
- **Unilateralism**: Reminiscent of colonial era unilateral employer control
- **Long-term Business Impact**: In long run, labor codes will not even benefit business
- **Labor Unrest Risk**: If there is threat to rights and security of workers, it will lead to labor unrest

### Specific Concerns

1. **Right to Strike Compromised**: Workers' very basic right to strike is significantly compromised
   
   - Workers have to give advance notice of 14 days to management
   - 150 days in a year workers will not be able to strike

2. **Hire and Fire**: Labor codes make it easy for employers to hire and fire workers, adversely affecting job security

3. **Contractual Labor Increase**: Contractual labor which was already very high will now increase phenomenally due to new framework facilitating contract work

### Implementation Status

- Due to stiff opposition, implementation has been stalled
- Quite unlikely that these will be implemented before 2024 general elections  
- Many state governments have not passed the rules required to implement the laws

## BONDED LABOR (122:00)

### Definition and Characteristics

- **RAVI SRIVASTAVA** in "Bonded Labor in India: Its Incidence and Pattern" provides comprehensive analysis
- **Definition**: Bonded labor refers to a long term relationship between an employee and an employer which denies the employee various freedoms such as:
  - Freedom to choose one's employer
  - Freedom to renegotiate terms of employment
- **Characterized by**: Compulsion or coercion
- **Credit-Debtor Relationship**: Often involves a creditor-debtor relationship between employer and employee
- **Adverse Contractual Stipulation**: Involves adverse contractual stipulation which are not justified by law and prevailing labor market conditions

### Legal Framework

- **Article 23**: Of Indian Constitution prohibits trafficking in human beings and forced labor
- **Bonded Labor System Abolition Act 1976**: Parliament passed this act
- **Rehabilitation Scheme**: Scheme for rehabilitation of bonded labor was started in 2016

### Social Conditions Contributing to Bonded Labor

**According to D. KUMAR**: There is a link between social discrimination and bonded labor

- **Chief Victims**: Scheduled castes, tribals and women are chief victims of bonded labor
- **Examples**: 
  - Sexual exploitation of women in DEVADASI system in KARNATAKA
  - JOGINI system in ANDHRA PRADESH  
  - Debt induced prostitution by women

### Prevalence and Patterns

- **National Commission on Rural Labor**: Estimated that agricultural laborers were the primary category of bonded labor
- **BARDHAN and RUDRA**: Highlighted that with capitalist development of agriculture, the problem of bonded labor has worsened
- **Geographic Pattern**: Underdeveloped regions like eastern UP, BIHAR - people in intergenerational debt are transported to PUNJAB, HARYANA because these guys want cheap labor
- **Brick Kilns**: Bonded labor have been rescued from brick kilns by civil society organizations like BANDHUA MUKTI MORCHA and BACHPAN BACHAO ANDOLAN

### Elimination Strategies

**According to RAVI SRIVASTAVA**: Major problems in elimination of bonded labor

1. **Identification Challenge**: First major problem is identifying it - civil society organizations can play important role

2. **State Action Necessity**: 
   
   - Properly enforce penal provisions - punishment must occur for keeping bonded labor
   - Effectively implement rehabilitation schemes

3. **Rehabilitation Requirements**:
   
   - Those rescued from bonded labor have to be made employable
   - Skills have to be enhanced so that credit needs can be met without promising unwanted labor in return

4. **Long-term Solutions**:
   
   - Requires elimination of poverty
   - Developing extensive social security system  
   - Formal credit mechanisms have to be encouraged
   - Strengthen rural credit institutions network

## CHILD LABOR (142:00)

### Arguments For and Against Child Labor

**Arguments Often Made in Favor:**

- Increases family income for poor families
- Child is earning and acquiring skills (training/apprenticeship)
- Financial independence and contribution to family income
- Skill sets develop, contributing to national growth

**Arguments Against (NEERA BURRA - "Born to Work: Child Labor in India"):**

- **Not Beneficial Long-term**: Family income does not improve because in long run family will be worse off
- **Not Training**: It is not a form of training and apprenticeship - no skill development happening
- **Fewer Skills**: At end of day, person will have fewer skills and lesser knowledge
- **Educational Compromise**: Leads to educational deprivation, keeping people in same social status

### NEERA BURRA's Analysis

- **Worst Form of Exploitation**: Child labor is the worst form of exploitation
- **Problems with Child Labor**:
  - Sometimes includes bonded labor
  - Sometimes accompanied with sexual abuse
  - Children frequently work in hazardous work environment
  - Given very low level of income - not compensated adequately
  - Leads to educational deprivation
  - Deprived of workers' rights - not considered as proper workers

### International Perspective

**According to ILO (International Labor Organization):**

- Child labor perpetuates poverty across generations
- It retards economic growth and slows down social development

### Statistical Overview

- **2011 Census**: 10.1 million working children in India in age group of 5 to 14 years

### Major Reasons for Child Labor (ILO)

- **Poverty**: Self-explanatory - to ensure survival, poor families compelled to supplement family income through child labor
- **Intergenerational Debt**: Debt passed down through generations
- **Informal Nature of Economy**: Lack of regulation enables child labor

### GURURAJ SANGHERA's Globalization Perspective

- **Conventional Understanding**: Focuses on historical and socio-cultural factors like caste, gender, illiteracy, poverty etc.
- **Globalization Link**: Need to understand child labor in context of globalization also
- **Dual Impact**: 
  - On one hand: Global emphasis on rights of child internationally
  - On other hand: Money has dried up for NGOs focusing on child rights
- **Cost Competition**: Globalization requires cut-throat competition, entailing cutting down costs including labor costs
- **Cheaper Labor**: Child labor is far cheaper and more easily subject to capitalist exploitation

**SANGHERA Suggests**: For fuller understanding of child labor, its linkages with globalization have to be understood

- **Civil Society Silenced**: Civil society organizations working for child rights have been silenced in global capitalist economy
- **Firms Seek Cheap Labor**: In global capitalist economy, firms seek cheap labor as cost advantage

### Way Forward

**Multi-pronged Approach Required:**

- **Sustained Economic Growth**
- **Respect for Labor Standards** 
- **Universalizing Education**
- **Social Security Measures**
- **Recognizing Rights of Children**

**Implementation Focus:**

- Don't need new laws - already have laws to deal with child labor
- **Require**: Effective implementation of laws to prevent child labor
- **Also**: Successful implementation of Right to Education Act will have direct bearing on incidence of child labor
- **Effective Rehabilitation**: Child labor also needs to be effectively rehabilitated
