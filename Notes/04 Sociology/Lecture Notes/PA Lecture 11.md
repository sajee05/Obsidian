# DURKHEIM'S THEORY OF RELIGION AND DIVISION OF LABOR IN SOCIETY

## RECAP: DURKHEIM'S THEORY OF RELIGION (14:16)

### Definition of Religion

- **DURKHEIM defines religion as**: A unified system of beliefs and practices that are related to sacred things that are things that are set apart and foreigners which united member into a single community for the church
- Religion is a system of unified beliefs and practices that guide that unites people and classify them into sacred things that are set apart and forward 
- It brings a community into a moral community, giving all the members of the society a more coherent structure

### Key Concepts

#### Sacred vs Profane Relationship

- **Sacred and Profane are not dichotomous**: In reality, sacred and profane are not purely separate categories
- In terms of power and dignity, sacred is infinitely superior to profane
- It is not the utility of a thing which makes it sacred
- Through rituals a thing can make a passage from one category to the other
- **Examples of mixed sacred-profane elements**:
  - In Hindu culture, books (not just scriptures, even textbooks) are treated with a degree of sacredness
  - Everyday meals have a certain degree of sacredness associated with them despite being profane activities

#### Book Reference

- **DURKHEIM'S book on religion**: The Elementary Forms of Religious Life

### Functions of Religion According to DURKHEIM

1. **Source of strength during hardships**: Religion provides strength particularly during death and difficult times
2. **Shared sense of morality**: Religion gives society a shared moral framework
3. **Relationship between God and society**: Relation between God and man is same as relationship between society and man - society is not dependent on the individual
4. **Collective effervescence**: Religious rituals produce collective effervescence, strengthening bonds between individual and community
5. **Social control mechanism**: Religion helps maintain social solidarity and social cohesion
6. **Unifying force**: Religion serves as a mechanism that unites people on various bases

### Criticisms of DURKHEIM'S Theory of Religion

#### Major Criticisms Identified

1. **Ignores violence and social evils**: DURKHEIM'S theory ignores the various social evils which have been spawned by religion like Sati etc.
2. **Limited applicability**: May not be applicable to more complex belief systems or world religions like Hinduism, Christianity (these are complex religions, not modern religions)
3. **Armchair sociology**: He was an armchair sociologist who lacked extensive field work
4. **Source of oppression**: Religion is patriarchal and serves as a source of oppression, justifying and legitimizing women's oppression - something which DURKHEIM doesn't take up in his writings
5. **Divisive in modern societies**: In modern multi-religious societies, religion acts as a divisive force rather than a cohesive force
6. **Unified only at tribal level**: Religion was unified at the level of the tribe, not at broader levels
7. **Replacement by nationalism**: The old sacred things like the bible are being replaced by new sacred symbols - the national flag, the national anthem serve the same purpose in our society, uniting us on the national basis

## DOUBT CLEARING SESSION (24:04)

### Question on Religion in Modern Multi-Religious Societies

- **Student doubt**: If DURKHEIM'S notion of religion in modern times is of civic religion or nation worship rather than conventional religion, and nation worship acts as a unifying force, how is divisiveness a criticism?
- **Response**: Religion as conventionally understood and those religions which are considered as religions in DURKHEIM'S theory are a source of divisions and conflicts in the modern world. Religious identities and religious affiliations need to be downplayed in modern society to bind people together

### Concept of Agency

- **Agency of the individual**: The individual has volition or free will to make a choice, to decide for himself what he wants to do

### DURKHEIM and the Concept of God

- **Why DURKHEIM didn't include God in his definition of religion**: He was of the view that there can be godless religions, particularly giving the example of Buddhism wherein there is no belief in a supernatural being or entity called God
- DURKHEIM believed that a notion of God or a supernatural entity or superpower is not necessary for a religion, but the notion of the sacred is integral to religion
- Even Buddhism has certain things or principles which are regarded as sacred
- **DURKHEIM'S background**: He was born in a Jewish family but was very secular in his orientation

### Can Society Exist Without Religion?

#### Different Perspectives Discussed

- **Functionalist view**: A lot of functional theorists contend that religion is a must because it plays such an integral role in promoting social cohesion
- **Need for moral consensus**: We need a moral consensus for society to exist, for division of labor to exist, for us to depend on each other
- **Definitional dependency**: It depends on the definition of religion - if you understand religion as any source of shared morality, then possibly all societies would have religion in some form or the other
- **Historical examples**: Examples like China under CCP (Communist Party of China) and socialist countries during cold war years when USSR was at peak strength, where religion was actively prohibited
- **Alternative sources of morality**: Theoretically there can be other sources of shared morality - communist ideology may serve as a source of shared morality

## DIVISION OF LABOR IN SOCIETY (35:09)

### Introduction and Context

- **Previous coverage**: Division of labor had been defined, ADAM SMITH'S contributions analyzed - how it contributed immensely to productivity and production increase in modern industrial society
- **DURKHEIM'S broader perspective**: Division of labor has much larger domain than just production. It benefits the whole of the society and meets the very needs of the society with broader scope

### Central Question Driving DURKHEIM'S Research

- **Core puzzle**: With increased individualism, what is keeping the modern society intact? Why isn't it literally falling apart?
- If each person is seeking his own or her own benefit, then what is keeping the modern society together?
- This quest led DURKHEIM to undertake research and writing on division of labor

### Three Factors Leading to Societal Change (Pre-modern to Modern)

When a society changes from pre-modern pre-industrial society to a modern industrial society, three factors lead to this transformation:

#### 1. Volume

- **Definition**: Volume is simply another word for the size of the population
- **Change pattern**: Size of population or volume is low in pre-industrial society and increases as society becomes industrialized and modern
- Increase in volume is one of the contributory factors leading to modernization

#### 2. Material Density

- **Definition**: Material density simply refers to the population density
- **Change pattern**: Population density is higher in modern society and lower in pre-modern society
- Increase in density of population contributes to society's transformation from pre-modern to modern

#### 3. Moral Density

- **Definition**: Moral density refers to the frequency of social interactions
- **Change pattern**: Frequency of social interactions is higher in modern society than in pre-modern society

### Explanation of Higher Social Interactions in Modern Society

#### Reasons for Increased Moral Density

1. **More people to interact with**: In modern societies there are simply more people available for interaction
2. **Population density**: More people are compactly packed per unit area, contributing to more frequent interactions  
3. **Technology improvements**: With improvements in communication and transportation technologies, the frequency of interaction increases

#### Historical Progression of Communication

- **Communication evolution**: 300 years back messages were sent by pigeon, then came post, then telephone, then mobile phone, then WhatsApp
- **Result**: People are now in contact with a larger number of people more frequently
- **Modern vs traditional patterns**: 
  - Traditional: Get up, go to fields, visit village chopal/square, return home, sleep
  - Modern: Continuously interacting with other human beings, starting from opening WhatsApp in the morning

| Material Density         | Lower population density        | Higher population density         |
| Moral Density            | Lower frequency of interactions | Higher frequency of interactions  |
| Communication Methods    | Limited (pigeon, face-to-face)  | Advanced (WhatsApp, mobile, etc.) |
| Social Structure         | Village-based, limited contacts | Urban-based, extensive networks   |
| Division of Labor        | Simple                          | Complex and specialized           |
