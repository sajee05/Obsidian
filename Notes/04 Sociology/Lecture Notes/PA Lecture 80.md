# Perspectives to Study Indian Society

## INTRODUCTION (05:10)

- The session covers **three perspectives to study Indian society**: Indological, Structural-Functional, and Marxist approaches
- Today's agenda focuses on two of these approaches: **Indological and Structural-Functional**
- These approaches represent different methodological frameworks for understanding Indian social reality

## INDOLOGICAL APPROACH (17:40)

### Definition and Core Principles

- **Indology**: The term literally means "Indo + logy" where logy means study, referring to the systematic study of Indian society and culture
- **Core Premise**: Indian society and culture is very unique, clearly different from Western society and culture - it is one of its own kind
- **Fundamental Argument**: Western theories and models are inadequate to fully understand Indian society

### Key Characteristics

- **Focus on Uniqueness**: This approach considers that Indian society and culture is unique
- **Indigenous Framework**: Western theories and models are therefore inadequate to fully understand Indian society
- **Value-Based Understanding**: To develop a full understanding of the social reality of India, sociologists need to understand Indian values, Indian philosophy and Indian religions
- **Textual Foundation**: Indologists recommend a detailed study of ancient Indian literature such as Sanskrit texts and also Pali and Dravidian literature

### Methodological Approach

The Indological approach emphasizes on the study of:

1. **Sanskrit texts and literature**
2. **Pali and Dravidian literature** 
3. **Study of various Dharmashastra, Puranic literature, Vedas, Upanishads, the Epics**
4. **Deciphering ancient languages**
5. **Translating ancient texts**
6. **Study of inscriptions and manuscripts**
7. **Accounts of Indian society by various travelers**
8. **Ancient literary texts and archaeological evidences**

### Conceptual Framework

- **Cultural Concepts**: The approach highlights how Indians use Indic concepts in everyday thought
- **Language Limitations**: Western languages are not fully capable of capturing the meaning of Indic terms

#### Examples of Untranslatable Concepts

**Dharma**:

- Multiple dimensions: duty at various levels (occupational duty, family duty, caste-based duty)
- Also means religion (Hindu dharma, Christian dharma, Sikh dharma)
- Refers to justice (opposite of adharma)
- Represents cosmic order and balance in society and universe
- In Buddhist thought, used in different dimension (dharma chakra)
- Refers to the very essence of any entity (species being)

**Karma**:

- Entails action and doing (deed)
- Built into the notion of karma is the concept of divine retribution
- Effects on future state based on actions

**Atma**:

- Commonly mistranslated as "soul" but conceptually very different
- The Indic concept of atma differs significantly from the Western notion of soul

### Historical Development

#### Pioneer Scholar

- **G.S. GHURYE**: Pioneered this approach in Indian sociology, referred to as "Father of Indian Sociology"
- Established the first Department of Sociology in Bombay University around 1919-1920
- Had great fluency in Sanskrit and familiarity with Indian scriptures and ancient scriptures

#### Pre-Ghurye Foundations

The approach existed before Ghurye's application to sociology:

**18th Century Origins**:

- **Asiatic Society of Bengal**: Established by SIR WILLIAM JONES in late 18th century
- **Royal Asiatic Society**: Established in England in 1824
- **American Oriental Society**: Established in 1822  
- **German Oriental Society**: Established in 1845

#### Colonial Period Contributors

**European Scholars**:

- **HENRY MAINE**: Wrote "The Ancient Law"
- **CHARLES WILKINS**: Translated the Bhagavad Gita
- **MAX MÜLLER**: Wrote "The Sacred Books of the East"

**Indian Scholars**:

- **JADUNATH SARKAR**
- **P.V. KANE**
- **R.G. BHANDARKAR**

**Organizations Supporting Indological Studies**:

- **Theosophical Society**: Established by COLONEL OLCOTT and MADAM BLAVATSKY
- **Oriental Research Institutes**
- **Bhandarkar Institute, Pune**
- **Banaras Hindu University**: Established by PANDIT MADAN MOHAN MALAVIYA

### Contemporary Relevance

**Present Day Status**:

- Indology does not enjoy the same popularity as it once did
- Some contemporary scholars continue to use this approach

**Contemporary Scholars**:

- **WENDY DONIGER**
- **SHELDON POLLOCK** 
- **RAJIV MALHOTRA**
- **KOENRAAD ELST**
- **KAPIL KAPOOR**
- **AUDREY TRUSCHKE**

**Current Centers**:

- **World Sanskrit Conference**: Held regularly since 1972
- **Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies**
- **American Institute for Indian Studies**

### Factors Contributing to Development (54:30)

#### Ghurye's Background

- His fluency in Sanskrit and great familiarity with Indian scriptures and ancient scriptures played a role

#### Socio-Political Climate

- **Colonial Justification**: Europeans relied upon scriptural interpretation to justify colonial rule (White Man's Burden)
- **Indian Response**: Various Indian philosophers, reformers, national leaders relied upon scriptural study to defend Indian culture and civilization and to make a case for the greatness of Indian society and culture

#### Existing Knowledge Base

- Before Ghurye incorporated this approach, there was already a rich body of Indological literature developed by various organizations, colonizers, and scholars

### Evaluation of Indological Approach (59:40)

#### Contributions

1. **Highlighted Uniqueness**: This approach highlighted the uniqueness of Indian society and culture
2. **Indigenous Development**: Helped to develop an indigenous approach instead of blindly imitating Western theoretical frameworks  
3. **Indian Perspective**: Helped us to understand Indian society from an Indian perspective
4. **Cultural Distinctiveness**: Acknowledges and builds upon the distinctiveness of Indian culture

#### Criticisms (73:20)

1. **Book View vs Field View**: 
   
   - **M.N. SRINIVAS** criticizes the Indological approach as "book view" and prefers the "field view"
   - Texts may be far removed from social reality

2. **Prescriptive vs Descriptive**:
   
   - Texts possibly outline how society should be instead of how society is
   - The texts possibly were prescriptive not descriptive

3. **Ahistorical Nature**:
   
   - This approach is criticized as being ahistorical, meaning it ignores the changes that have taken place in Indian society and culture

4. **Conservative and Status Quoist**:
   
   - Study of Indian society based on Indological approach tends to justify social hierarchy
   - Scriptures typically tend to justify male dominance over women and higher status to higher castes

5. **Equation Issues**:
   
   - The Indological approach errs when it equates Indian society with Hindu society and Indian culture with Hindu culture
   - Further erroneously equates Hindu culture with Brahmanical culture
   - **KANCHA ILAIAH SHEPHERD** points out that the culture of OBCs and Dalits is vastly different from Brahmanical Hinduism

6. **Lack of Objectivity**:
   
   - The same scripture, the same texts are interpreted in vastly different ways by different people
   - Same text interpreted by colonizers vs reformers vs national leaders yields different conclusions

## STRUCTURAL-FUNCTIONAL APPROACH (82:24)

### Definition and Core Concepts

- **Structure**: The way the society is made up and various social groups, social institutions are arranged in a particular order
- **Function**: What it does good for the society, how it contributes to the maintenance and stability of the society

### Theoretical Framework

- **Society as Organism**: The structural functional approach compares society to an organism
- **Interconnected Parts**: Just like in an organism, different parts are interconnected with definitive structure, and each part performs its respective functions
- **Social Institutions**: Various social institutions like family and kinship, religion, political system, stratification system, economy are interconnected and interdependent

#### Key Principles

1. **Holistic View**: Society is viewed as a whole - its parts cannot be understood in isolation
2. **Interlinkage**: The various social institutions are interlinked and interdependent  
3. **Functional Contribution**: The different parts of society perform various functions that contribute to the maintenance and well-being of the society as a whole

### Pioneer and Development

#### M.N. SRINIVAS

- **Background**: Student of GHURYE in Bombay, later went to England
- **Influences**: Greatly influenced by British anthropologists **A.R. RADCLIFFE-BROWN** and **EVANS-PRITCHARD**
- **Method**: Developed field study methodology influenced by these British anthropologists studying African society and Oceanic tribes
- **Application**: Applied participant observation and field study method to study India's villages

#### Dominance Period

- Structural functional approach became the dominant approach during **1950s and 1960s**
- Following SRINIVAS, numerous other scholars applied this approach in Indian sociology and anthropology

### Major Village Studies

#### André Béteille's Sripuram Study (102:00)

**Village Profile**:

- **Location**: Sripuram village in Tamil Nadu, about 8 miles from Thanjavur
- **Population**: 349 houses, approximately 1400 persons
- **Caste Composition**: Three broad caste groups

| Caste Group          | Population Percentage | Characteristics                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brahmins             | 24%                   | Ritually pure, superior and dominant, land owning, powerful               |
| Non-Brahmin Peasants | 49%                   | Regarded as ritually inferior, lesser power and land compared to Brahmins |
| Adi Dravidas         | 26%                   | Considered ritually polluting, powerless landless agricultural laborers   |

**Spatial Organization**:

- **Agraharam**: Where Brahmins lived
- **Kudiyaana**: Where non-Brahmin peasants lived  
- **Cheri**: Where Adi Dravidas lived
- Clear residential segregation existed

**Traditional System**:

- Clear and undisputed caste hierarchy
- Caste hierarchy clearly overlapped with class and power hierarchy
- Brahmins considered cheri to be filthy and avoided entering it at all costs

**Modern Transformations**:

- Sripuram is undergoing significant social transformation due to various factors:
  - Democratic politics
  - Anti-Brahmin movement
  - Influence of nearby urban centers
  - Modern education

**Changes Observed**:

- Brahmins have sold a lot of land to non-Brahmin peasants
- Absentee landlordism has become common
- Brahmin landlords are feeling increasingly insecure
- Relations with non-Brahmin and Adi Dravida laborers have deteriorated
- Sripuram is now characterized by triangular bitterness

**Key Insight**:

- **BÉTEILLE** suggests that the caste system no more provides an adequate framework to analyze village society in India today
- The three dimensions (caste, class and power) need to be analyzed separately
- New political and economic arrangements have emerged in Sripuram which are not dependent on caste

#### S.C. Dube's Shamirpet Study (120:00)

**Publication**: 

- **1955**: "Indian Village" - holistic study of Shamirpet village
- **Later**: "India's Changing Villages" - highlighting changes in Shamirpet

**Location**: Shamirpet village in Telangana near Hyderabad

**Approach**: Very holistic study covering various dimensions - caste, land ownership, religion, rituals, family patterns

**Key Finding**: Despite numerous castes, the village society was characterized by integration

**Changes**: Due to contacts with the city of Hyderabad, numerous changes taking place in Shamirpet

#### Other Major Studies (1955 Landmark Year)

**M.N. SRINIVAS - "India's Villages"**:

- Edited volume containing 17 village studies conducted by various Indian, British and American anthropologists and sociologists
- Included SRINIVAS's own study of Rampura village
- Outlined the concept of **DOMINANT CASTE**
- Challenged the colonial notion of Indian villages as self-sufficient and isolated ("little republics")

**MCKIM MARRIOTT - "Village India"**:

- Developed concepts of **UNIVERSALIZATION** and **PAROCHIALIZATION**
- Linked them to concepts of **GREAT TRADITION** and **LITTLE TRADITION**

**D.N. MAJUMDAR - "Rural Profiles"**:

- Re-examined some contributions by SRINIVAS like Sanskritization and dominant caste
- Suggested **DESANSKRITIZATION** was occurring

### Srinivas's Detailed Studies

#### Study of Coorg (129:00)

**Publication**: "Religion and Society Among the Coorgs of South India"

**Geographic Profile**:

- **Location**: Mountainous region near Kaveri river in Karnataka
- **Language**: Kodagu (independent language connected to Kannada)
- **Accessibility**: Inaccessible and isolated due to geography, dense forests, frequently flooded
- **Economy**: Primarily agricultural and agrarian, revolves around rice cultivation
- **Crops**: Rice cultivation and coffee plantations (introduced by British)

**Colonial Impact**:

- Coorg was invaded and annexed by British in 19th century
- Led to many changes including abolition of slavery and introduction of coffee

**Social Organization**:

- Over 40 different castes and tribes in Coorg
- **Coorgs Community**: Economically and politically powerful
- Strong resemblance between Coorgs and Kshatriyas
- Coorgs are good soldiers and good in hunting, competitive games, dancing and warfare

**Cultural Practices**:

- Coorgs do not perform Vedic rituals and chant mantras
- They consume pork and alcohol but not beef
- Attracted to army jobs and see themselves as militaristic/martial type

**Family System**:

- **Okka**: Patrilineal and patrilocal joint household among Coorgs
- Only male members have rights in ancestral property
- Sex-based segregation in the okka
- Ancestral home very large, can accommodate up to 250 members
- Verandah occupied by men who also receive guests
- Women entertain female guests in kitchen and inner rooms
- During celebrations like harvest festival, men sing and dance while women watch from distance
- Honor for men to die in battlefield and for women to die in child bed
- A woman with 10 living sons is celebrated in Coorg society

#### Rampura Study (145:00)

**Publication**: "A Remembered Village"

**Background**:

- SRINIVAS spent 11 months in Rampura in 1948
- Continued to visit for many years
- Field notes got destroyed in office fire
- Reconstructed the village from memory, recollections and fragments of burnt notes

**Methodology**:

- Put into practice the method of **participant observation**
- Located only 6 km away from SRINIVAS's ancestral home
- Collected genealogical data and conducted surveys
- Tried to form relationships with members of all castes but was not very successful
- Got absorbed in the village high caste community
- High caste people treated him like an educated urban Brahmin

**Content**: SRINIVAS writes detailed sections on economy, politics, religion and kinship in the village

### Evaluation of Structural-Functional Approach (151:50)

#### Contributions

1. **Dominant Position**: Became the dominant approach in Indian sociology and anthropology during 1950s and 1960s
2. **Corrective to Book View**: Provided a corrective to the book view and Indological approach
3. **Empirical Foundation**: Provides an empirical foundation to Indian sociology and study of Indian society
4. **Dynamic Nature**: Highlighted the dynamic nature of Indian society and captured the fluidity present in Indian society
5. **Policy Inputs**: Provided crucial inputs for policy making and helped capture transformation taking place due to progressive legislation, constitutional provisions, government schemes and forces of modernization
6. **Concept Development**: Helped in development of important concepts like universalization, parochialization, dominant caste, Sanskritization, vote bank

#### Criticisms (155:50)

1. **Over-emphasis on Integration**: Over-emphasizes upon cooperation and integration and down-plays conflict, exploitation and oppression

2. **Lack of Diversity Appreciation**: Fails to appreciate the diversity across India's villages - develops concepts in one village and assumes applicability across India

3. **Heavy British Influence**: Heavily influenced by British anthropology, fails to take into account the uniqueness of Indian culture and Indian situation

4. **Rural Focus**: Focused primarily on rural areas, consequently ignoring the urban social landscape

5. **Caste-Centric View**: Studies Indian society or villages through the prism of caste - caste has been an overwhelming concern in village studies
