# Tribal Development Approaches in India

## Definition and Characteristics of Tribes (18:00)

### Classic Definition of Tribes

- **Isolated politically autonomous**
- **Geographically secluded**
- **Culturally distinct**
- **Primitive traits and shyness of contact with others**
- **Primitive mode of production or pre-agricultural level of technology**
- **Subsistence economy**

### Indian Context Understanding

- **Non-Hindu, non-Muslim social groups**
- **Understood in contrast to caste people**

### Problems with Traditional Understanding

- **Continuum concept**: SURAJIT SINHA gives the concept of tribe-caste continuum
- **SURAJIT SINHA** also talks about Rajput-tribe continuum
- **GHURYE** suggests that tribals are backward Hindus, not a separate category - they are very much a part of Hindu samaj

## Tribal Revolts During Colonial Period (22:00)

### Causes of Tribal Revolts

- **Colonial state restricted their movement in the forest**
- **Access to forest produce was regulated**
- **Outsiders called DIKUS** entered tribal areas
- **Land alienation and loss of traditional rights**

### Notable Tribal Revolts

- Various uprisings occurred during 1818 and other periods
- **British didn't go to many tribal areas initially**

## Post-Independence Approaches to Tribal Development (26:00)

### Three Broad Approaches Considered

#### 1. Isolation Approach (28:00)

**Main Proponent: VERRIER ELWIN**

- **VERRIER ELWIN** was a British individual who came to India as a missionary
- **Took up Indian citizenship** after independence and stayed back in India
- **Spent decades amongst tribal people**, initially came to Pune but shifted to central India
- **Produced several rich monographs** about tribal lives and their ways of life
- **Even married a tribal woman** (though divorced later)
- **Became adviser to NEFA administration** (Northeast Frontier Administration) for tribal policy
- **Very close to NEHRU**; GANDHI said "I consider you as a son"

**Core Principle:**

- **The state or mainstream society should not interfere in the affairs of the tribals**
- **Hands-off approach** - let them be
- **ELWIN was against state intervention**
- **Also opposed Christian missionaries and Hindu reformers entering tribal areas**
- **Non-tribals should not impose their lifestyle on the tribals**

**ELWIN's Major Work:**

- **"The Aboriginals"** - one of his significant works on tribals

**Heavy Criticism of Isolation Approach:**

- **THAKKAR BAPA** and other reformers criticized this approach
- **Accused anthropologists like ELWIN of romanticizing the tribal way of life**
- **Criticized as "National Park Approach"** - preserving tribals as if in a museum for amusement of anthropologists
- **Would deny tribals the fruits of development**
- **GHURYE** was one of the fiercest critics of ELWIN
- **Would keep tribals backward forever in perpetuity**

**Where This Approach Has Been Followed:**

- **Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)** like those in Andaman and Nicobar Islands
- **Fifth and Sixth Schedules** of Indian Constitution reflect this isolation policy
- **Restrictions on non-tribals buying land from tribals**
- **Inner Line Permit** required in border areas like Arunachal Pradesh

#### 2. Assimilation Approach (41:00)

**Main Proponent: G.S. GHURYE**

- **For GHURYE, tribals are backward Hindus**
- **Very much part of the Hindu fold but not fully Hinduized**
- **Tribes suffer from certain cultural defects because of imperfect Hinduization**
- **These cultural defects prevent development of tribals**

**Cultural Defects According to GHURYE:**

- **High incidence of alcohol consumption**
- **Use of drugs and intoxicants**
- **Loose sexual morals**
- **Sensuous dancing**
- **Inefficient agricultural practices**

**Statistical Evidence (NFHS-5 Data):**

- **General Indian population**: 19% men consume alcohol
- **Scheduled Tribe population**: 33% men consume alcohol
- **General women population**: 1% consume alcohol  
- **Scheduled Tribe women**: 6% consume alcohol

**Solution According to GHURYE:**

- **Tribals should be assimilated into the Hindu fold**
- **Make them fully Hindu to rectify cultural defects**
- **Complete Hinduization would remove impediments to development**

**Criticism of Assimilation Approach:**

- **Imposes culture of mainstream society onto tribals**
- **Suffers from ethnocentric bias viewing Brahminical culture as superior**
- **Would result in loss of cultural diversity**
- **Militates against basic template of Indian civilization which respects cultural diversity**

**Implementation Status:**

- **Not implemented as stated public policy**
- **Happening naturally at society level through social interaction**
- **Examples**: ORAONS of Chhotanagpur Plateau worship Hindu gods and engage Brahmin priests
- **THARU and KHAS tribes** in central Himalayas are completely Hinduized

**GHURYE's Response Work:**

- **"The Aboriginals So-Called and Their Future"** - written in response to ELWIN's "The Aboriginals"

#### 3. Integration Approach (52:00)

**Core Principle:**

- **Benefits of modernization should reach the tribals**
- **But non-tribals must not impose their culture on the tribals**
- **Tribals should be given option to modernize**
- **Access to electricity, modern education, schools, roads, healthcare**
- **But their cultural core should be preserved**

**What Should Be Preserved:**

- **Dressing patterns, customs, rituals, language, art forms, dance**

**Evolution of Scholars:**

- **Both ELWIN and GHURYE later moved from their respective positions**
- **Both eventually supported the integration approach**
- **This integration approach was finally adopted by the Indian state**
- **Has the best of both worlds**

## Tribal Panchsheel by NEHRU (55:00)

**Overall Framework:**

- **Laid down by JAWAHARLAL NEHRU**
- **Five principles guiding tribal development**
- **Similar to Panchsheel principles guiding Sino-Indian relations**

### The Five Principles:

#### 1. Non-Imposition

- **Nothing should be imposed on the tribals**
- **They must be allowed to develop along the lines of their own genius**
- **Should encourage their own traditional arts and culture**
- **Mainstream should not impose their way of life on tribal populations**

#### 2. Respect for Tribal Rights

- **Tribal rights in land and forests should be respected**
- **Mindful of colonial period when ownership, control, access to lands and forests was systematically curtailed**
- **Respect rights that tribals have over their lands and forest resources**

#### 3. Team Building

- **Attempt must be made to train and build up a team of their own people for administration and development**
- **Technical expertise from outside will help in beginning**
- **But too many outsiders must not be sent in tribal territory**
- **Need to develop leadership potential within tribal groups**
- **Eventually tribals should not be dependent on others for development**

#### 4. Avoid Over-Administration

- **Should not over-administer tribal areas**
- **Should not inundate them with too many schemes and programs**
- **Arrangements that state puts in place should not work at cross purposes with existing arrangements**
- **Try to work in tandem with traditional ways**
- **Utilize their traditional arrangements to extent possible**

#### 5. Quality Over Quantity

- **Results must be judged by quality of human character evolved**
- **Not by statistics or amount of money spent**
- **Focus on producing good human beings rather than quantitative measures**

## Constitutional Provisions and Policy Measures (65:00)

### Constitutional Articles

- **Article 15(4)**: Empowers state to make special provisions for advancement of socially and educationally backward classes or SCs and STs
- **Article 19(5)**: Safeguarding tribal interests - special restrictions for protection of scheduled tribes
- **Article 23**: Human trafficking (particularly affects tribals)
- **Article 29**: Minority rights - cultural and educational rights
- **Article 164**: Provides for minister in charge of tribal welfare in MP, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, etc.

### Policy Framework

- **National Commission for Scheduled Tribes**
- **Scholarships, free ships, reservations**
- **Reservations in legislature, administration, education**
- **Fifth and Sixth Schedules** of constitution
- **Special role and powers of Governor** vis-Ã -vis tribal affairs

### Tribal Sub-Plan Approach (68:00)

- **DHEBAR COMMITTEE** pointed out insufficient allocation of funds for tribal development
- **Following this, Tribal Sub-Plan Approach was adopted**
- **Whatever is total planned expenditure, amount has to be earmarked for tribals in proportion to their share in population**

**Example**: If annual plan has expenditure of 100 crores for education and tribals constitute 7.5% of population, then 7.5 crores should be spent on tribal education

## Impact of Tribal Development Policy (80:00)

### Positive Developments

#### Infrastructure and Connectivity

- **Huge sums of money spent** on tribal development by successive governments
- **Earlier geographical seclusion has ended** due to improved road connectivity and railways
- **Lot of developmental infrastructure created** - schools, healthcare centers, electricity

#### Educational Progress

- **Literacy rate risen substantially** from 3.5% in 1951 to 59% in 2011
- **Educated middle class has emerged** amongst tribals
- **Increasing participation in positions of power** - legislatures, administration
- **Thanks to reservation policy** - tribal bureaucrats, MLAs, MPs in third tier

#### Political Consciousness

- **Rise in political consciousness** of tribals
- **Educated leadership emergence** giving rise to political awareness
- **Many tribes asserting their identity and demands**
- **Numerous tribal movements and agitations** even after independence

### Critical Analysis and Discontent (85:00)

#### Manifestations of Tribal Discontent

- **Statehood demands**: Some fulfilled (Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh), others pending (Bodoland, Gorkhaland)
- **Secessionist movements**: Greater Nagaland movement wanting separate country
- **Protests for recognition of tribal religion** - SARNA religion separate from Hinduism
- **Agitations against land acquisition** for developmental projects
- **Demands for inclusion/exclusion in ST list**: For and against inclusion of new tribes

**Example**: GUJARS and BAKARWALS protesting against granting ST status to certain communities

#### Reasons for Tribal Discontent

##### 1. Development-Induced Displacement (90:00)

- **NEHRU's state considered big dams and modern industries as temples of modern India**
- **Focused on rapid large-scale industrialization**
- **Required resources, so Indian state kept intruding into tribal areas**
- **Large-scale developmental projects resulted in displacement of tribal populations**

**Expert Group Findings (2000):**

- **Government established Expert Group on Prevention of Alienation of Tribal Land**
- **47% of total population displaced by developmental projects were tribals**
- **Tribals are only 7.5-8% of total population**
- **Disproportionately adversely affected by developmental projects**
- **Tribals are victims of development** - bear cost while others reap fruits

##### 2. Poor Rehabilitation Policies (97:00)

**WALTER FERNANDEZ** pointed out problems:

- **Poor implementation** of rehabilitation and resettlement policies
- **Fertile land replaced with barren or distant land**
- **Inadequate cash compensation** easily spent on frivolous things
- **Job offers in industries** but tribals not equipped with required skills
- **No consultation** with affected population
- **Inadequate prior notice** often not given
- **Highly centralized decision making**

**Results:**

- **Increased landlessness** of tribals
- **Loss of livelihood**
- **Cultural alienation** - tribal culture intimately connected to surroundings

##### 3. Comparative Disadvantage (105:00)

**Statistical Evidence (2011 figures):**

| Parameter           | Total Population | Scheduled Castes | Scheduled Tribes |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Below Poverty Line  | 22%              | 29.4%            | 43%              |
| Literacy Rate       | 74%              | 66%              | 59%              |
| Access to Amenities | Better           | Moderate         | Worst            |

- **Tribals worse off than Scheduled Castes** on various parameters
- **VIRGINIA XAXA** has pointed out how tribals lag behind non-tribals

##### 4. Loss of Traditional Occupations (109:00)

**People of India Report by Anthropological Survey of India** highlights:

- **Strong anti-tribal psyche** in educational institutions

**Example Quote**: School principal said "tribal children from first standard to 8th standard mental level same" - bundling all tribal children together

##### 6. Health Problems (116:00)

**Three Types of Diseases:**

1. **Diseases of underdevelopment**: Malnutrition, stunting, higher infant mortality
2. **Diseases common in tribal population**: Sickle cell anemia, snake bites, animal bites
3. **Diseases of modernity**: Hypertension, health issues from alcohol and tobacco consumption

##### 7. Armed Conflicts (119:00)

**Three Types:**

1. **Conflicts between different tribes**

2. **Conflicts between tribals and non-tribals**  

3. **Conflicts between tribals and the state**
- **State resorts to draconian measures** like AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act)

##### 8. Uneven Distribution of Benefits (129:00)

- **More than 700 tribes** but few have benefited more from modernization
- **Some politically more assertive** than others
- **Within communities** some families immensely benefited while large segments remain deprived

**NADEEM HASNAIN** identified reasons for ethno-nationalist movements:

- **Indebtedness, land alienation, poverty, unemployment**
- **Ineffective rehabilitation, depopulation, displacement**

## Impact of Globalization on Tribals (133:00)
