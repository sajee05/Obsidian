# Sociology Lecture: DURKHEIM'S Suicide Theory Review and TALCOTT PARSONS' Social System Theory

## Quick Recap of DURKHEIM'S Theory (19:09)

### Social Facts Review

- **Social Facts**: Collective ways of acting, feeling and thinking that are external to the individual and endowed with the power of coercion by reason of which they control him
- **Types of Social Facts**: 
  - Material (technology) which can be directly observed
  - Non-material which can be indirectly observed
- **Source**: DURKHEIM describes the methodology in "The Rules of Sociological Method"
- **Research Rules**: Four types of rules including observation rules where research should be free from any biases and topics should be defined very clearly
- **First Rule**: Distinguishing between normal and pathological social facts

### DURKHEIM'S Suicide Theory

- **Definition of Suicide**: Any action or inaction done by a person knowing that the resultant will be death, integral to understanding of suicide
- **Two Key Factors**: Level of social integration and moral regulation affect suicide rates in society
- **Four Types of Suicide**:

| Type       | Characteristics                     | Examples                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Egoistic   | Low social integration              | Urban settings, celebrities, modern society                |
| Altruistic | Excessively high social integration | Jawar, Sati, soldier deaths in battlefield                 |
| Anomic     | Very low moral regulation           | Economic boom/bust, stock exchange people, farmer suicides |
| Fatalistic | Excessively high moral regulation   | Prison suicides                                            |

### Contemporary Applications

- **Farmer Suicides**: Can be explained as anomic (due to rising aspirations society cannot temper due to globalization) or fatalistic (excessive pressure from money lenders)
- **Student Suicides in KOTA**: Egoistic (away from family, low social connections) or anomic (society unable to temper expectations)
- **Celebrity Suicides**: Often anomic type

## Criticism of DURKHEIM'S Suicide Theory (49:02)

### Data Reliability Issues

- **Official Statistics Problem**: Suicide rates can be vastly under-reported due to variety of reasons
- **Police Under-reporting**: In countries where suicide is a crime, police officials may pass off actual suicides as accidents to show lower crime rates
- **Social-Cultural Distortion**: Certain religions consider suicide a grave sin, leading families to cover up suicides, distorting data

### Methodological Limitations

- **Ignored Attempted Suicides**: DURKHEIM only studied actual/committed suicides, ignoring attempted suicides
- **Gender Data Distortion**: According to DURKHEIM, men have higher suicide rates than women, but feminist researchers point out more women attempt suicides than men
- **Ecological Fallacy**: DURKHEIM compared regional data (Catholic vs Protestant regions) and inferred religious community differences without individual-level data

### Theoretical Limitations

- **Psychological Factors**: DURKHEIM'S theory significantly downplays the role of psychological factors in suicide analysis
- **Individual Psyche**: Why specific unmarried men commit suicide requires understanding individual psychology, not just social patterns

## Introduction to TALCOTT PARSONS (65:09)

### Background Information

- **Time Period**: 1902-1979, American sociologist
- **Academic Influence**: His writings dominated American sociology for two decades, particularly in 1950s
- **Position**: Head of sociology department at Harvard University
- **Ideological Stance**: Staunch defender and celebrant of modern American society, American values, culture, and capitalism

### Major Theoretical Contributions

- **Two Grand Theories**:
  1. Theory of Social System (covered in UPSC syllabus)
  2. Theory of Social Action (not in UPSC syllabus - ignore even if mentioned in sources)
- **Pattern Variables**: Only aspect of action theory covered in UPSC syllabus
- **Theoretical Approach**: Functionalist scholar focusing on contributions of various social institutions

## PARSONS' Theory of Social System (70:57)

### Understanding System Concept

- **System Definition**: According to Oxford Dictionary - "a group of parts working together with a regular relationship"
- **Alternative Definition**: A collection of interrelated parts, objects or things
- **Key Characteristic**: System indicates an orderly arrangement of various parts working in coordinated fashion
- **Examples**: Solar system, respiratory system, digestive system, computer system, database management system

### Historical Context

- **Previous Scholars**: Before PARSONS, founding fathers like SPENCER and DURKHEIM had also viewed society as collection of interrelated parts
- **PARSONS' Contribution**: Developed systems view very explicitly and clearly, making his name synonymous with systems approach

### Definition of Social System

- **DUNCAN MITCHELL Definition**: Social system consists of two or more individuals interacting directly or indirectly in a bounded situation
- **PARSONS' Definition**: "A plurality of individuals interacting with each other in a social situation which has an environment. The various actors are driven by motivation to maximize their gratification"

### Characteristics of Social System

1. **Interaction**: Involves interaction between two or more social actors
2. **Social Situation**: Takes place in a specific social context
3. **Common Values and Goals**: Characterized by common values, goals, and consensus on expectations
4. **Institutionalized Roles**: Roles are institutionalized patterns of expected behavior

### Role and Status Explanation

- **Status**: Position occupied in society (teacher, father, son, employer)
- **Role**: What one does as occupant of that status (role expectations based on shared norms and values)
- **Role Expectations**: Common understanding of what is expected from each role in society
- **Institutionalization**: Roles become well-established, patterned behaviors in social system

## Functional Prerequisites - AGIL Framework (94:24)

### Concept of Functional Prerequisites

- **Definition**: Certain tasks that must be accomplished for the continued maintenance and well-being of the social system
- **Purpose**: If society/social system is to continue to exist, certain needs must be met
- **Analogy**: Similar to organism needing food for survival

### Four Functional Prerequisites (AGIL Framework)

| Function                | Meaning                                        | Subsystem                 | Purpose                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A - Adaptation**      | Society must continuously adapt to environment | Economic Subsystem        | Generate/acquire resources from outside, provide food and shelter |
| **G - Goal Attainment** | Determine collective goals and prioritize them | Political Subsystem       | Allocate resources, mobilize members to pursue goals              |
| **I - Integration**     | Maintain coordination and coherence            | Legal/Judicial Subsystem  | Minimize conflicts, resolve disputes                              |
| **L - Latency**         | Pattern maintenance and tension management     | Family/Religion/Education | Pass values to next generation, manage individual stress          |

### Detailed Explanation of Functions

#### Adaptation Function

- Society needs at least some control over external environment
- Economic subsystem performs this through technological innovations
- At minimum, food and shelter must be provided for society members
- Example: Adapting to declining earth fertility or depleting petroleum reserves

#### Goal Attainment Function

- Determining collective goals of society and prioritizing amongst them
- Allocating resources for their attainment and motivating/mobilizing members
- Political subsystem/government decides collective goals
- Example: Modi government's Swachh Bharat campaign as collective goal

#### Integration Function

- Maintaining coordination and coherence in social system
- Minimizing chances of conflict and providing mechanism to resolve conflicts if they arise
- Legal and judicial subsystems perform this function
- Ensures harmony through clearly laid down laws and judicial dispute resolution

#### Latency Function

- **Pattern Maintenance**: Pattern of values prevalent in society must be passed down from one generation to next
- **Tension Management**: Various stresses and strains produced on individuals need to be resolved or addressed
- Various agencies of socialization (family, religion, education system) perform this function

## Social Change Through Systems Theory (115:16)

### System Boundaries and Environment

- **Boundary**: Social system has clear boundary distinguishing what is internal vs external to system
- **Environment**: Significant and clear difference exists between social system and its environment
- **Maintenance**: This boundary is maintained between system and environment

### Dynamic Equilibrium Process

- **State of Equilibrium**: Social system exists in state of cooperation and harmony between constituent subsystems
- **Continuous Exchange**: Social system is in continuous exchange with environment
- **Change Process**:
  1. Inputs from environment disturb state of equilibrium
  2. As part of social system gets affected, various other linked subsystems adjust
  3. Social system maintains itself in state of dynamic/moving equilibrium
- **Nature of Change**: Change is largely viewed as harmonious, incremental, progressive (not disruptive or violent)

### Cybernetic Hierarchy of Control (133:03)

- **Four Action Systems**: Organismic system (body level), Personality system (mind level), Social system (interaction level), Cultural system (shared norms/values)
- **Needs Flow**: Bottom to top (from organismic to cultural system)
- **Control Flow**: Top to bottom (cultural system provides guidelines for need satisfaction)
- **Example**: Body feels hunger → mind processes → social institutions (family) provide food → prepared according to cultural norms

## Criticism of PARSONS' Social System Theory (149:25)

### Limitations in Explaining Change

- Views social change as very orderly, peaceful, harmonious, and evolutionary
- Does not adequately explain revolutionary, radical, violent, and disruptive changes
- Focus on incremental change misses major social transformations

### Ideological Bias

- **American Glorification**: PARSONS literally glorifies American society and culture in his writings
- **Lack of Objectivity**: Not scientific or dispassionate analysis; reflects committed patriotic American perspective
- **Example**: Claims high divorce rates in America indicate high value attached to marriage (while low rates in India suggest people don't expect much from marriage)

### Theoretical Criticisms

- **C. WRIGHT MILLS' Critique**: 
  - "I have translated PARSONS into English" - criticism of unnecessary heavy jargon
  - Much of PARSONS' work can be condensed into few lines
  - Excessive focus on grand theorizing rather than empirical research
- **Universal Application Question**: Critics question whether theories developed in American context have universal application
- **Lack of Empirical Evidence**: PARSONS provides no empirical evidence to support his theories

## Pattern Variables Theory (158:05)

### Theoretical Background

- **Influences on PARSONS**: Classical functionalism (macro approach) + WEBER's emphasis on social action (micro approach)
- **PARSONS' Contribution**: First to translate WEBER's works from German to English, introducing WEBER to English-speaking world
- **Synthesis**: PARSONS tried to blend macro approach of functionalism with WEBER's micro approach focusing on social action

### Concept of Pattern Variables

- **Definition**: Pattern variables refer to dilemmas that social actor must resolve before he can act in an action situation
- **Function**: Actor must choose from sets of dichotomous choices in order to perform his role
- **Purpose**: Define nature of social interaction and role expectations in social system
- **Overall Direction**: Provide direction in which members of social system choose to perform their roles

### Five Pattern Variables

| Pattern Variable                        | Dilemma                        | Traditional Society         | Modern Society                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Ascription vs Achievement**           | How to identify counter actors | Ascription (birth-based)    | Achievement (performance-based) |
| **Diffuse vs Specific**                 | Range of obligations           | Diffuse (broad obligations) | Specific (narrow obligations)   |
| **Particularism vs Universalism**       | Basis of interaction           | Particular relationships    | Universal criteria              |
| **Affectivity vs Affective Neutrality** | Emotional involvement          | Emotional relationships     | Emotionally neutral             |
| **Collectivity vs Self**                | Whose interests to prioritize  | Collective interest         | Self-interest                   |

### Detailed Explanation of Pattern Variables

#### 1. Ascription vs Achievement (Quality vs Performance)

- **Dilemma**: How counter actors are to be identified - based on ascriptive criteria or achievement
- **Example**: Should teacher focus on students based on caste (ascription) or classroom performance (achievement)

#### 2. Diffuse vs Specific

- **Dilemma**: Range of obligations of actor towards counter actors
- **Diffuse**: Broad, spread out obligations (teacher as mentor for entire UPSC preparation)
- **Specific**: Narrow, confined obligations (teacher only for sociology syllabus completion)

#### 3. Particularism vs Universalism

- **Dilemma**: Whether to act based on particular relationship with different counter actors or universal principles
- **Example**: Should teacher treat own daughter in class same as other students (universalism) or give special attention (particularism)

#### 4. Affectivity vs Affective Neutrality (Immediate vs Deferred Gratification)

- **Dilemma**: Whether relationship should be emotional or without emotion
- **Examples**: 
  - Mother-child relationship characterized by affectivity but needs neutrality for discipline
  - Doctor-patient relationship should be affectively neutral for professional effectiveness

#### 5. Collectivity vs Self

- **Dilemma**: Whose interests should be prioritized - social group/wider society or one's own interest
- **Example**: Teacher prioritizing student community benefit vs maximizing personal returns

### Social Change Through Pattern Variables

- Traditional societies exhibit one set of orientations (Type A)
- Modern societies exhibit opposite orientations (Type B)  
- Social change understood as shift from traditional to modern orientations
- Process of modernization indicated by opting for modern-type orientations

## Criticism of Pattern Variables Theory (191:02)

### False Dichotomy Problem

- **Issue**: PARSONS presents pattern variables as polar opposites requiring either/or choice
- **Reality**: In real social world, people often opt for something in the middle
- **Example**: Teacher-student or doctor-patient relationships need not be either totally emotion-laden or completely devoid of emotion

### Incomplete Framework

- **Non-exhaustive List**: Critics argue this list of dilemmas is not exhaustive
- **Missing Dilemmas**: Social actors may face other dilemmas in different action situations apart from these five
- **Cultural Limitation**: Framework may not capture all possible dilemmas across different societies

### Cultural Specificity

- **Universal Application Claims**: PARSONS claims universal application for pattern variables
- **Culture-Specific Reality**: Framework is drawn from/based on American culture and context
- **Limited Applicability**: Different cultures may have other dilemmas or not have these specific dilemmas
- **Diversity Issue**: Set of dilemmas may not be applicable to other societies and cultures
