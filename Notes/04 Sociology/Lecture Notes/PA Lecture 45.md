# Social Change: Theories and Agents

## INTRODUCTION AND RECAP (17:44)

- The lecture begins with a recap of previously discussed social change theories
- **Social Change Definition**: Any change in human relationships is social change
- Students are asked to recall key evolutionary and cyclical theories of social change

## EVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF SOCIAL CHANGE (19:33)

- **Social Darwinism**: Society as an organism evolves from single small to large and complex
- Society also evolves from a smaller size to a larger and from simple to complex
- This evolution is accompanied by **differentiation and integration**

### Critique of Evolutionary Theory

## CYCLICAL THEORIES OF SOCIAL CHANGE (20:49)

### Sorokin's Theory

- **Book**: "Social and Cultural Dynamics"
- Society passes through different kinds of cultural mentalities:
  1. **Ideational**: Spiritual focus
  2. **Sensate**: Material focus
  3. **Idealistic**: Balance between spiritual and material
- Functions like a **pendulum** - society moves from one stage to another via the idealistic

### Spengler's Theory

- **Book**: "Decline of the West"
- Theory suggests inevitable civilizational decline
- **Contested by Arnold Toynbee** who argued:
  - Civilizational decline is not inevitable
  - Western civilization is not facing imminent decline

## MODERNIZATION THEORY (23:17)

- **Core Premise**: Developed nations have responsibility to support developing countries
- Provides technological and financial aid to Third World countries

## DEPENDENCY THEORY (27:23)

### Key Theorists

- **Raul Prebisch**
- **Celso Furtado** 
- **Andre Gunder Frank**

### Core Arguments

- **Critique of Modernization Theory**: Modernization benefits First World countries

### Development of Underdevelopment (30:10)

- **Concept by A.G. Frank**
- First World countries became developed at the cost of and by causing underdevelopment
- **Extraction of wealth and resources** from Third World countries
- Dependency relationship has continued even after colonial period through various mechanisms

## MECHANISMS OF DEPENDENCY PERPETUATION (31:03)

### Role of First World Governments

- Maintain **hegemonic control** through combination of **hard power and soft power**

#### Hard Power

- US remains engine of global capitalist system
- Far ahead in nuclear stockpiles and conventional warfare machinery

#### Soft Power (34:01)

- **Culture of the West** is very seductive

### Technology Transfer (39:13)

- First World countries **dump obsolete technology** in Third World
- **Prevents development of indigenous technology**
- Creates dependency on First World as source of technology
- Newer technological developments and innovations take place in First World

### Role of Local Elites (42:21)

- Leaders are typically **educated and trained in the West**
- Adopt mindset that Western approach will benefit their countries also

### Internal Colonialism (45:50)

- **Rural areas, villages, tribal areas** serve as satellites or periphery
- Resources from hinterland extracted for development of major urban centers

### Dealing with Non-Compliant Leadership (48:06)

- If Third World leadership doesn't promote First World interests:
  1. **Replaced by fomenting popular unrest**
  2. **Subjected to sanctions**
  3. **Assassination of leadership** (CIA as regime change department)
- Ensures **compliant regime** that secures First World economic interests

## CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE OF DEPENDENCY THEORY (55:54)

### Outdated Perspective

- Theory framed during **Cold War period (1960s-70s)**
- Uses Cold War language (First World, Third World)
- **After end of Cold War** and demise of communism, dependency view gone out of fashion

- **Capitalism is the only economic model** in the world

### Benefits of Integration

- Many **East Asian countries** have benefited from greater integration

### Regional Integration

- Regional integration bodies like **ASEAN, MERCOSUR, SAARC**
- Third World countries rely more on each other through these mechanisms
- Somewhat insulated from First World dependency

## CONTINUED RELEVANCE ARGUMENTS (63:02)

### Scholarly Support

- **Barbara Stallings** analyzed China's relationship with Latin American countries from dependency perspective
- China establishing dependency relationship with Latin American countries

### 2008 Financial Crisis Evidence (64:37)

- **Housing bubble in US** had ripple effect on Third World economies
- **Petras and Weltmeyer** argue disturbances in core countries still negatively impact Third World economies

### Regional Integration Limitations (66:28)

- **Regional integration more successful in First World** than Third World
- **Kapohl and Fink** point out regional integration in South less successful than North
