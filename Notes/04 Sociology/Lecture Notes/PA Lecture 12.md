# Durkheim's Theory of Division of Labor in Society

## INTRODUCTION TO DIVISION OF LABOR (00:00)

- The lecture begins with discussion about recording the division of labor
- Some people are there to help us but earlier this was not the case
- The importance of skill efficiency has increased
- **Division of Labor**: A fundamental concept in understanding social transformation

## FACTORS LEADING TO SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION (00:22)

- **Key Change**: There is a change in technology as society transforms
- **Technology in Premodern Society**: Very basic or rudimentary simple
- **Technology in Modern Industrial Society**: Far more advanced and complex

### The Three Factors of Dynamic Density

According to **DURKHEIM**, society transforms from premodern to modern society with changes in three factors:

1. **Volume**: Size of population increases
2. **Material Density**: Density of population increases  
3. **Moral Density**: Frequency of social interaction increases
- These three factors are combinedly referred to as **dynamic density**
- As these three factors increase, society transforms from a small-sized simple premodern traditional society to a modern large scale complex society

## CHANGES IN DIVISION OF LABOR CHARACTERISTICS (02:04)

As society changes from traditional to modern, there are changes in various aspects of work or division of labor:

### 1. Technology Advancement

- **Traditional Society**: Basic, rudimentary technology
- **Modern Society**: Far more advanced and complex technology

### 2. Number of Occupations

- **Traditional Society**: Limited job categories (10-20-30 occupations)
  - Most people engaged in agriculture
  - Others in allied activities like livestock rearing
  - Traditional occupations: sonar, kumhar, lohar
- **Modern Society**: Tens of thousands of occupations literally

### 3. Degree of Specialization

- **Increased Specialization**: Each job is now far more specialized than earlier
- **Examples of Specialization**:
  - Not just an engineer → textile engineer, computer engineer, mechanical engineer
  - Not just computer engineer → software engineer or hardware engineer  
  - Not just software engineer → C++ programmer, Oracle programmer
  - Medical field: ENT specialist, heart specialist, even retina specialist

| Aspect                | Traditional Society   | Modern Society                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Technology            | Basic, rudimentary    | Advanced, complex                 |
| Number of Occupations | 10-30 occupations     | Tens of thousands                 |
| Specialization Level  | General, broad roles  | Highly specialized, niche areas   |
| Examples              | Farmer, kumhar, lohar | C++ programmer, retina specialist |

## BASIS OF DIVISION OF LABOR (05:45)

### Premodern Society Basis

- **Ascriptive Criteria**: Based on caste
- **Family Occupation**: Following traditional family professions
- **Gender**: Gender-based task allocation
- **Age**: Young people doing certain tasks, children assigned different tasks

### Modern Society Basis

- **Skill and Talent**: Based on individual capabilities
- **Qualifications**: Educational achievements
- **Experience**: Professional background
- **Interest**: Personal inclination and motivation
- **Ability and Education**: Individual merit
- *Note*: Gender and other traditional factors still play a role in modern society

## WHY COMPLEX DIVISION OF LABOR IS NECESSARY (08:35)

- **Primary Reason**: Very necessary for the very survival of the society
- **Core Function**: To manage competition between people at reasonable levels

### Population and Competition Analysis

- **Village Population**: About 1000 people with 30 occupations = ~30 people per occupation
- **Modern City (Delhi)**: 2 crores population with only 30 occupations = massive competition
- **Solution**: More occupations mean manageable competition levels

### Practical Example

- A **C++ programmer** competes only with other C++ programmers, not with all engineers
- The lecturer's example: Not just a teacher → sociology teacher → sociology optional teacher for UPSC exam → competing with only 4-5 others

**Result**: This specialization enables society to peacefully manage competition keeping it within manageable limits for a very large-sized population.

## POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS IN SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION (16:11)

### Homogeneity vs Heterogeneity

| Characteristic    | Premodern Society                                                  | Modern Society                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Population Nature | Homogeneous                                                        | Heterogeneous                         |
| Description       | People quite similar to each other                                 | People very different from each other |
| Metaphor          | "As if produced from the same mold" or "photocopies of each other" | Diverse in all aspects                |

### Specific Characteristics

**Premodern Society Similarities**:

- Same religion (beliefs, practices, rituals, festivals)
- Same kind of clothing and food habits
- Same racial stock
- Similar occupations with limited differentiation
- Lives intimately connected to nature
- Simple lifestyle
- Similar daily routines, thinking patterns, values, norms

**Modern Society Differences**:

- Different religious beliefs and practices
- Different creed and color (racial diversity)
- Different physical features
- Different occupations with clear class distinctions
- Different mindsets, thinking, daily routines
- Urban lifestyle variations

## CONSCIENCE COLLECTIVE (20:51)

- **Definition**: Refers to the totality of beliefs and sentiments that are common to the members of the society
- **Simple Understanding**: What the average person on the street will approve of or not
- **Metaphor**: Like individual conscience (antaratma), but for the entire society

### Strength Comparison

| Society Type | Conscience Collective Strength | Individual Control                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Premodern    | Strong                         | High - matters what society thinks  |
| Modern       | Weakened                       | Low - individual autonomy increased |

### Modern Example of Weakened Conscience Collective

- **Question**: Should we eat cow meat?
- **Modern Response**: Differing views based on religion, caste, upbringing, education, political orientation
- **Traditional Response**: Clear societal prohibition (especially in Hindu society)

**Impact**: Collective conscience represents the hold of society over the individual, and with modernization it is weakened.

## INDIVIDUALISM IN SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION (25:24)

### Comparison of Individualism

| Society Type      | Individualism Status    | Characteristics                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Premodern         | Suppressed, discouraged | Strong collective control          |
| Modern Industrial | Flourishes, strong      | Legitimate, encouraged, acceptable |

### Durkheim's Concern

- **Traditional Society**: Understandable how society remains intact due to strong collective conscience and checked individualism
- **Modern Society**: Individualism knows no bounds
- **Central Question**: How will society hold together when individualism is uncontrolled?

## NATURE OF LAW (26:53)

### Legal System Comparison

| Aspect              | Premodern Society     | Modern Society            |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Law Type            | Repressive            | Restitutive               |
| Punishment Severity | Very harsh            | Proportionate             |
| Crime Perception    | Against whole society | Against individual victim |
| Purpose             | Punishment/deterrence | Restore previous state    |

### Examples of Legal Systems

**Premodern Repressive Law**:

- If you steal → hands will be cut
- If you look at woman inappropriately → eyes will be gorged out
- Any crime seen as breaking societal norms

**Modern Restitutive Law**:

- If you cheat someone of 1 lakh rupees → return money with nominal interest
- Focus on restoring victim rather than punishing society's moral order

### Modern Exceptions

- **Death Sentence**: Still exists in India and US but used in "rarest of rare cases"
- **Examples**: Parliament attack, Nirbhaya gang rape incident
- **Reasoning**: Crimes that shock collective conscience of whole society still treated as crimes against society

## NATURE OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS (31:22)

### Relationship Characteristics Comparison

| Aspect              | Premodern Society                      | Modern Society                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Formality           | Informal                               | Formal                                     |
| Personal Connection | Personal                               | Impersonal                                 |
| Emotional Content   | Emotional                              | Unemotional                                |
| Duration            | Durable, lasting lifetime/generations  | Short lived, transient                     |
| Basis               | Multi-dimensional, family-like         | Rules based, purpose driven, transactional |
| Care Level          | High belongingness, concern for others | Low care, focused on specific functions    |

### Practical Examples

**Village (Premodern) Scenario**:

- If student doesn't come to class → teacher cycles to their hut and asks about 10 other things
- People called each other "chacha" or "biya" even if not relatives
- Whole village like one big family

**City (Modern) Scenario**:

- If student doesn't come to class → teacher doesn't care
- People address others formally ("excuse me")
- Focus only on specific function (teaching sociology)

**Student-Teacher Relationship Example**:

- Modern: Students don't ask about teacher's personal life (daughter, wife, parents)
- Traditional: More holistic, caring relationships
- **Mutual Nature**: "The feeling is mutual, or the absence of feeling is mutual"

## INTERDEPENDENCE IN SOCIETY (39:28)

### Degree of Interdependence Comparison

- **Traditional Society**: Less interdependence
- **Modern Society**: Far more interdependence

### Why More Interdependence in Modern Society

**Individual Specialization**:

- Each person confined to very narrow occupational role
- People's needs have multiplied due to advanced technology
- One person knows only one specialized thing but needs many things

**Daily Life Example**:

- **Simple act of brushing teeth**: Dependent on toothbrush manufacturer, toothpaste manufacturer, water utility supplier
- **Coming by car**: Dependent on car manufacturer, supply chain, retailer, petrol pump attendants, electricity providers, driver, cleaners, administration
- **Teaching profession**: Dependent on geography teacher, history teacher, polity teacher, economics teacher for student success

### Traditional Society Self-Sufficiency

- **Simple lifestyle**: Get up, daily ablutions in fields, grow food using cow dung as manure
- **Direct consumption**: Whatever family grows, they consume
- **Limited needs**: No cars, petrol, internet dependencies
- **Technology factor**: Rudimentary technology meant fewer dependencies

## TYPES OF SOLIDARITY (46:02)

### Mechanical Solidarity (Premodern Society)

- **Source**: Sameness/homogeneity of people
- **Mechanism**: People united because they are similar to each other
- **Basis**: Shared beliefs, values, practices, similar lifestyles
- **Control**: Strong collective conscience maintains unity

### Organic Solidarity (Modern Society)

- **Source**: High degree of interdependence
- **Mechanism**: Despite individualism and differences, people bound together by mutual dependence
- **Example**: "I'm not killing you because I'm greatly dependent on you"
- **Basis**: Complementarity and specialization

### Durkheim's Answer to Social Cohesion

- **Question**: How does modern society hold together despite individualism?
- **Answer**: Through heightened interdependence (organic solidarity)
- **Practical Result**: Increased specialization leads to increased complementarity

## ANOMIE - THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD (68:28)

### Definition and Basic Understanding

- **Anomie**: Literally means normlessness
- **Context**: Intervening period during transformation from premodern to modern society
- **Problem**: Absence of norms is troubling because shared norms are necessary for smooth functioning of collective lives

### Characteristics of Anomie Period

- **Normative Confusion**: Either absence of norms or prevalence of multiple conflicting norms
- **Social Guidance**: Society unable to provide clear guidelines
- **Individual Impact**: People are mighty confused, no agreement between people
- **Personal Conflict**: Even individuals confused in their own minds

### Contemporary Indian Examples

**Digital Space Conduct**:

- Is it acceptable to send friend request to unknown girl on social media?
- Where do you draw the line?
- No clear societal guidelines

**Gender Roles**:

- Should women manage household as primary responsibility?
- Conflicting feminist ideology vs traditional expectations
- Confusion about appropriate roles

**Professional Ethics**:

- Civil servants facing conflict between family norms (help relatives) and constitutional norms (no favoritism)
- Brother applying for government contract - should you favor him?

**Social Issues**:

- Is homosexuality acceptable? Legal but socially conflicting views
- Clothing choices for women - acceptable but situational confusion
- Career vs marriage priorities

### India as Society in Transition

- **Status**: India is in transition stage that **DURKHEIM** would term anomie
- **Characteristics**: Still undergoing economic, technological, political modernization
- **Traditional Elements**: Caste, joint family, religious salience still present
- **Modern Elements**: Western ideas, democratic institutions, industrial economy
- **Result**: Neither wholly traditional nor wholly modern

### Formal Definition and Description

**Anomie literally means normlessness. According to Durkheim, when a society changes from a traditional to a modern type, there is an intervening stage of anomie.**

**During this stage, the society is unable to offer clear guidelines to its members. In many areas of social life, there may be an absence of any governing norms or guidelines. In some other areas of social life, there may be conflicting norms. This creates a general atmosphere of confusion in society.**

**Anomie occurs during periods of drastic and rapid changes in the political, economic and social structures prevalent in the society.**

**During the period of anomie, traditional norms may have been destroyed. But new modern norms have not yet emerged to replace them. The old scale has been upset, but a new scale has not yet been devised.**

**The period of anomie is unstable, chaotic and rife with conflict. It is a period of social derangement. Social norms that provide stability and certainty have been weakened or are missing.**

**Individual members are consumed by insatiable desires. Many people consider that their work is meaningless and not valued by the society. The situation gives rise to social tensions and disorder. There is a general atmosphere of hopelessness and widely prevalent unhappiness.**

### Transitional Nature of Anomie

**According to Durkheim, the phase of anomie is transitional. The new modern norms will eventually completely replace the traditional ones. Confusion and unhappiness will be a thing of the past. The society will once again offer clear guidelines to its members as it transforms into a fully modern society.**

## ABNORMAL FORMS OF DIVISION OF LABOR (95:11)

**DURKHEIM** in his theory of division of labor talks about three abnormal forms of division of labor as follows:

### 1. Anomic Division of Labor (97:16)

- **Definition**: Lack of guidelines to regulate the economic behavior of man or behavior at the workplace
- **Core Problem**: Lack of norms/regulations to govern behavior in economy

**Historical Context**:

- When **DURKHEIM** was writing, industrial climate was very unhealthy
- Frequent industrial conflict between labor and management
- Factory workers and management would often clash

**Causes of Conflict**:

- **Management Goal**: Suppress wages to maximize profits
- **Worker Goal**: Higher wages and shorter working hours
- **DURKHEIM's Interpretation**: Lack of norms from society to regulate people's behavior at work
- **Result**: Everyone driven by incessant greed causing frequent clashes

### 2. Forced Division of Labor (100:24)

- **Definition**: When an individual is compelled into a particular occupation which is not according to his inclination, liking, abilities

**Detailed Explanation**: **An individual is compelled into an occupational role which does not match his temperament, inclination, interest and ability.**

**Causes of Forced Division**:

- **Poverty**: Intelligent person wants to do PhD but compelled to pull rickshaw due to financial constraints
- **Caste**: Traditional occupational restrictions
- **Parental Preferences**: Family pressure for specific careers
- **Other Social Factors**: Gender restrictions, social expectations

### 3. Inadequate Organization (103:03)

- **Definition**: People in work setup don't have clarity of what is expected of them
- **Characteristics**: Lot of ambiguity surrounding job profile
- **Modern Solutions**: Organizations now use KRAs (Key Responsibility Areas) or KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for clarity

**Problems Created**:

- People hanging around not doing anything specific
- No particular responsibility assigned
- Some people literally dying on roads in broad daylight while others pass by
- **Example**: Public sector banks where many employees belong to this category

**Why It's Abnormal**:

- **Expected Outcome**: Division of labor should increase efficiency
- **Actual Outcome**: Results in reduction of efficiency
- **Resource Waste**: People consuming resources (salary, organizational resources) but not contributing to productivity

**Formal Definition**: **Inadequate organization of work implies that the work is not properly distributed and coordinated amongst the different persons in an organization. This results in a decline in organizational efficiency instead of an increase.**

| Abnormal Form           | Core Problem                | Example                                | Impact                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Anomic                  | Lack of workplace norms     | Labor-management conflicts             | Excessive greed, frequent clashes        |
| Forced                  | Occupation-ability mismatch | PhD-capable person pulling rickshaw    | Individual dissatisfaction, inefficiency |
| Inadequate Organization | Unclear job roles           | Bank employees with no specific duties | Resource waste, decreased efficiency     |

## SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS ABNORMAL FORMS (107:49)

### 1. Professional Associations

**Concept**: Should have professional associations in all sectors of the economy

**Existing Examples**:

- **Medical Council of India**: For doctors/medical professionals
- **Bar Council of India**: For lawyers/legal profession  
- **Press Council of India**: For media professionals

**Characteristics**:

- Self-regulating voluntary associations of trade/profession members
- Not an arm of state/government
- Provide code of conduct for members

**Functions**:

- **Temper Greed**: Control excessive financial motivations
- **Inculcate Duty**: Develop sense of service to wider society
- **Professional Ethics**: Establish ethical standards for practice
- **Example**: Medical Council reminds doctors of Hippocratic oath - not to be driven solely by financial interests, give first consideration to patient's life and health

**Proposed Extension**: Should extend to other fields like teachers, civil servants, miners, bankers with self-regulating associations providing charters/codes of conduct.

### 2. Contracts (111:54)

**Definition**: Legal agreement between two parties which specifies the roles and responsibilities of both parties

**Application**: Should have written formal contracts governing various aspects of economic life

**Benefits**:

- **Clarity**: Both parties know what to expect from each other
- **Regulation**: Clear specifications prevent excessive demands
- **Example**: Factory contract specifying 9 hours work, 1 hour break, X rupees salary, specific incentives

**Result**: 

- Worker drawing 10,000 won't expect 50,000 because it's clearly spelled out
- Management duty bound to provide compensation mentioned in contract
- **DURKHEIM** drew a lot of hope from the birth of the contract

### 3. Role of State (113:48)

**Capacity**: The state or government can play a very effective role in addressing the problem of abnormal division of labor

**Policy Interventions**:

- **Reservation**: For disadvantaged groups
- **Scholarships**: Educational support to overcome economic barriers
- **Anti-Discrimination Laws**: Prohibiting discrimination in employment based on caste, gender, etc.

**Target**: Particularly effective for addressing **forced division of labor** caused by caste or poverty through positive state intervention.

| Solution                  | Target Problem  | Mechanism                         | Example                                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Professional Associations | Anomic Division | Self-regulation, ethics codes     | Medical Council's Hippocratic oath                  |
| Contracts                 | All forms       | Legal clarity, mutual obligations | Factory worker-management agreements                |
| State Intervention        | Forced Division | Policy interventions              | Reservation, scholarships, anti-discrimination laws |
