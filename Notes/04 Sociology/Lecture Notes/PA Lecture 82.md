- Response to modernization leads to proliferation of sects
- Differences of opinion and allegiances (like Shia-Sunni divide)

- Due to perceived corruption (as in the case of Protestant Reformation)

### Sect Lifecycles

### Major Hindu Gods According to Ghurye

- **Pentad**: Five principal gods - Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha, Devi (in whatever form), Surya

## Weber's Analysis of Hinduism (61:12)

### Weber's "The Religion of India"

- **Defining Features**: Two main characteristics Weber identifies:
  1. **Reverence for the Vedas**
  2. **Belief in the sacredness of the cow**

### Nature of Hindu Theism

- **Ghurye's Classification**: Hinduism characterized by "Monolatrous Pantheism"
- **Pantheism Definition**: "All is God" - everything around us is an aspect of divinity (Kan-kan mein Shankar)
- **Monolatrous Definition**: Worship of one god without denying the existence of other gods
  - Example: One may be devoted to Hanuman ji but doesn't deny divinity of Devi Maa, Vishnu ji, or Bhagwan Shri Ram

### Unity in Diversity Principle (72:07)

- **Core Concept**: The principle of unity is diversity - Unity in Diversity holds Hindu society together
- **Tolerance**: Respect and tolerance for diversity within Hinduism
- **Mutual Respect**: Even Hindu gods show respect to each other (Ram ji worships Shiva ji, Shiva ji and Parvati ji worship each other)
- **Brahmanical Role**: Brahmans helped formulate the idea of the Pentad and development of various gods through the notion of Pentadic unity

## Indian Sadhus: Ghurye's Analysis (76:32)

### Definition and Role

- **Who is a Sadhu**: One who seeks the truth, has given up on material attachments
- **Social Relationship**: Sadhus serve as guides who show the path, moral preceptors deserving immense respect due to their closer relationship with divinity
- **Renunciation Concept**: Sadhus are considered as if dead for society, including parents and siblings

### The Paradox of Renunciation

- **Contradiction**: On one hand, sadhus are considered socially dead and outside the pale of society
- **Social Reality**: On the other hand, sadhus have played a very central role in social life throughout Indian history
- **Exemptions**: They are not expected to follow caste-based regulations or jati dharma

### Why This Paradox Exists

- **Lack of Centralized Authority**: Hindu society does not have any centralized church-type organization
- **Leadership Role**: It has fallen upon the shoulders of sadhus to guide the society
- **Community Living**: Sadhus don't become hermits wandering alone in jungles but live in proper sampradayas (monastic orders)
- **Continued Influence**: Even modern examples show sadhus leading business conglomerates and states

### Historical Contributions

- **Multiple Roles**: Sadhus have acted as public teachers, encouraged learning of scriptures, and defended religion against external attacks
- **Cultural Unity**: Saints like Shankaracharya, Agastya, and Skanda ensured Hindu ideas are promoted in South India, ensuring cultural unity in the whole of India
- **Scholarly Functions**: They have contributed to intellectual, spiritual, moral, and social uplift of people and are therefore respected and revered

## Ambedkar's Critique of Hinduism (92:19)

### Fundamental Rejection

- **Core Position**: For Ambedkar, Hinduism is not worth being termed as a religion
- **Religion vs Hinduism**: A religion teaches morality to its followers, but Hinduism teaches immorality; a religion unites its adherents, but Hinduism divides its members

### Characteristics of Hinduism per Ambedkar

- **Lacks Consciousness**: Hinduism lacks reasoning and is against independent thinking
- **No Individual Development**: There is no scope for the development of the individual in Hinduism
- **Worthless Scriptures**: The Vedas, the sacred books of Hindus, are worthless

### "Riddles in Hinduism"

- **Book Analysis**: Ambedkar identified five riddles in Hinduism questioning:
  - Why ordinary human beings are made into gods
  - Why many Hindu gods are of questionable character
  - Why Brahmans made Hindu gods fight with each other
  - Why Hindu gods have lot of frailties (jealousy, vindictiveness)
  - Why there is no reason to consider Hindu scriptures as either infallible or sacred

### Critique of Major Hindu Figures

#### On Lord Ram

- **Birth Questions**: Ram's birth is miraculous but possibly allegorical to cover the truth that he was begotten upon Kaushalya by sage Shrung
- **Marriage Issues**: According to Buddhist Ramayana, Sita was Ram's sister, both children of Dasharatha
- **Murder of Vali**: Greatest blot on Ram's character - thoroughly unprovoked, cowardly, and premeditated murder
- **Treatment of Sita**: After killing Ravana, Ram subjects Sita to humiliation, suspecting her conduct and calling her sight revolting
- **Administrative Failure**: As king, Ram was nominal; Bharat administered the kingdom while Ram spent time with court jesters and in janana

#### On Lord Krishna

- **Youthful Conduct**: Krishna's career was full of illicit intimacy with young women of Vrindavan (called Raslila)
- **Moral Issues**: Krishna abandons his lawfully wedded wife Rukmini and seduces Radha, living with her in sin without remorse
- **Political Actions**: Every act as warrior and politician was immoral, whether assassination of maternal uncle Kansa or killing of Jarasanth

### Ambedkar's 22 Vows

When embracing Navyana Buddhism, Ambedkar administered 22 vows to his followers:

1. I shall have no faith in Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, nor shall I worship them
2. I shall have no faith in Ram and Krishna, nor shall I worship them
3. I have no faith in Gauri, Ganpati and other gods and goddesses of Hindus, nor will I worship them
4. I do not believe in incarnation of God
5. I do not believe that Lord Buddha was incarnation of Vishnu - I believe this to be sheer madness and false propaganda
6. I shall not perform Shraddh nor will I give Pindadan
7. I renounce Hinduism which is harmful for humanity and impedes advancement and development of humanity because it is based on inequality and adopt Buddhism as my religion

## Gandhi's Defense of Hinduism (110:33)

### Gandhi's Position

- **Identity Declaration**: "Let there be no doubt, I Gandhi, I am a Sanatani Hindu"
- **Belief System**: "I believe in the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas"

### Who is a Hindu According to Gandhi

Gandhi defines a Hindu as one who:

- **Believes in God**
- **Believes in immortality of the soul**
- **Practices transmigration** (soul moves from one body to another - punarjanma)
- **Follows the law of karma and moksha**
- **Practices truth and ahimsa in daily life**
- **Practices cow protection in its widest sense**
- **Acts according to the law of varnashrama**

### Gandhi's Response to Ambedkar

- **Textual Authenticity**: Many texts that Ambedkar quotes from the Smritis cannot be accepted as authentic
- **Caste vs Religion**: Caste has nothing to do with religion; it's a custom whose origins Gandhi doesn't know
- **Varna vs Caste**: Varna and ashram are institutions which have nothing to do with caste
- **Religious Merit**: A religion has to be judged not by its worst specimens but by the best it might have produced (referencing saints like Chaitanya, Gyandev, Tukaram, Tiruvalluvar, Ramkrishna Paramhans, Raja Rammohan Roy, etc.)

## Shashi Tharoor's Perspective (115:28)

### "Why I Am a Hindu"

- **Religious Nature**: Hinduism is a pantheistic faith meaning its followers believe in many gods
- **Individual Freedom**: Each person practicing Hindu faith is free to choose which specific gods they want to worship, which sacred texts to read, where and when they want to pray
- **Core Characteristics**: Hinduism by definition is inclusive, tolerant, and diverse belief system
- **Common Goal**: All Hindus are striving for common goal of achieving self-realization and oneness with Brahman
- **Personal Journey**: Every believer's journey is deeply personal and unique to him
- **Respect for All**: Respect for all sources of wisdom and faith extends to every part of Hindu culture

### Hinduism vs Hindutva Distinction

- **Hindutva as Political Ideology**: Hindutva is a dangerous political ideology clearly distinct from Hinduism
- **Appropriation Concern**: Hindutva is trying to appropriate Hinduism
- **Saving Hinduism**: Need to save Hinduism from being gobbled up by this politically pernicious and divisive political ideology
- **Fundamental Opposition**: 
  - Hinduism based on inclusivity and tolerance
  - Hindutva based on intolerance and exclusivity
  - Hinduism respects all faiths, beliefs, scriptures
  - Hindutva demonizes Muslims and Christians, questions their religions' connection to this land
