# Constitution, Law and Social Changes in Indian Society

## INTRODUCTION AND RECAP (29:33)

- **Previous lecture recap**: Discussion on Constitution, Law and Changes in Indian Society
- **Key scholars mentioned**:
  - **B.R. AMBEDKAR**: Highlighted the potential that Constitution and Law can bring changes to society
  - **T.K. OOMMEN**: Book titled "SOCIOLOGY OF LAW" - discussed the deepening of democracy through land reforms, education reforms
  - **MARK GALANTER**: Book "LAW AND SOCIETY IN MODERN INDIA"

### MARK GALANTER's Observations

- There are laws which affect social changes like intercaste marriages
- There are laws which promote intercaste marriages
- Yet endogamy prevails, showing clear conflict between people's thinking, their values and the laws
- Despite this clash, our legal system has flourished

### C.N. VENUGOPAL's Views

- Various things have not changed
- Several things have not changed
- Implementation is not effective even if the laws are there
- If implementation is not in effective hands, then progress will be hindered

## PROBLEMS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF LAWS (34:08)

### Major Issues Identified

#### Judicial Backlog

- **Problem**: We suffer from judicial backlog
- **Impact**: As the old proverb goes "Justice delayed is justice denied"
- **Consequence**: There is a travesty of justice because of long delays

#### Legal Illiteracy

- **Issue**: Holding back the further progress and proper implementation of laws
- **Effect**: People are not aware of their legal rights and procedures

#### Mindsets and Attitudes

- **Major roadblock**: People's mindsets
- **Scope**: Includes those entrusted with implementation of laws (members of executive) and interpretation of laws (judges)

### KALPANA KANNABIRAN's Analysis

- **Book**: "WOMEN AND LAW"
- **Key Point**: Patriarchal ideology prevents effective implementation of pro-women laws
- **Example**: Many court judgments prioritize societal norms over constitutional principles
- **Family Courts**: Often advise women to preserve their marriage even at the cost of dignity and autonomy because in Indian culture there is sanctity associated with marriage where women are culturally conditioned to adjust

## CRITICISM OF INDIAN CONSTITUTION AND LEGAL SYSTEM (38:05)

### General Criticisms

#### Constitutional Framework Not Progressive

- **Argument**: Indian Constitution is not as progressive as it is meant to be or made out to be
- **Instead**: It reflects the prevailing prejudices, viewpoints and concerns of the dominant sections of the society

#### Specific Scholarly Critiques

| Scholar            | Main Argument                 | Details                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A.R. DESAI**     | Bourgeois Constitution        | From Marxist perspective, argues it's a bourgeois constitution  |
| **FLAVIA AGNES**   | Male bias in legal provisions | Particularly with laws, property, personal laws                 |
| **AIVAR JENNINGS** | Lawyer's Paradise             | Constitution is too full of legalese, unnecessarily complicated |

#### Lawyers' Paradise Critique

- **Term coined by**: IVAR JENNINGS ⭐ (The transcript shows conflicting spellings - "Lakshmikanta" and "Ivar Jennings" - this needs verification)
- **Meaning**: It's a lawyer's paradise and a common man's nightmare
- **Issues**:
  - Too full of legalities/jargon
  - Unnecessarily complicated
  - Lengthiest written constitution in the world
  - Normal person cannot fight their own case
  - Even highly educated persons cannot do it without special training in law
  - Law is intimidating for the best among us
  - Makes justice expensive

#### Outdated Laws Problem

- **Current status**: Constitution has been criticized for having many obsolete/outdated rules, laws or provisions
- **Government action**: Modi government since 2014 has scrapped more than 2000 outdated laws and rules
- **Remaining issue**: There is still a lot more which remains to be done

### Examples of Problematic Laws

- **Kite flying**: Under certain laws it was illegal to fly kites in Delhi because they would come under aircraft category requiring permits
- **Reason for such laws**: They were made in a very different social, technological context

### Proposed Solutions

- **Sunset Clause**: Laws should contain a provision that the law will lapse by X date (30-40 years) unless revisited and ratified by the legislature
- **Benefit**: Prevents the accumulation of laws that become a "cobweb of laws"

#### VIVEK DEBROY's Controversial Suggestion

- **Recent article**: Suggested perhaps we should go back to drawing board, start afresh and give ourselves a new Constitution
- **Argument**: Constitution of India is a colonial legacy, been around for too long
- **Supporting evidence**: University of Chicago Law Department study showing average lifespan of written constitution is only 17 years
- **Our Constitution**: More than 70 years since enactment, perhaps time to revisit

### Outdated Elements in Current Constitution

- **"Socialist" in Preamble**: Does it make sense to affirm we are a socialist country in today's age of globalization when we have enmeshed our economy with global capitalism?
- **Directive Principles**: Many are no longer relevant

## CONSTITUTION AS UN-INDIAN (82:19)

### Core Criticism

- **Irony**: The Indian Constitution is un-Indian
- **Meaning**: It is disconnected from our roots, from our culture
- **Process**: We have simply replicated whatever the British left us with
- **Founding Fathers**: Were lazy in the sense they did not bother to create an indigenous constitutional framework

### Copy-Paste Nature

- **Reality**: It is largely a cut, copy, paste with few edits of the Government of India Act of 1935
- **Sources**: Borrowed heavily left, right and center unabashedly
- **AMBEDKAR's Response**: When accused of copying, he said it's very difficult and highly unlikely to come up with something new at such a late stage when so many constitutions have been drafted

### Missing Indian Elements

- **Traditional concept**: DHARMA, which finds no mention in the Constitution
- **Character**: Based on Western liberal political principles
- **HANUMAT THAYYA's Quote**: "We hope to hear the music of the veena and the sitar but what we hear is the English band" - referring to the Constitution having nothing authentic and indigenous about what we have created

### Modern Criticism

- **J.S. DEEPAK**: Developed critique on similar lines that constitutional framework reeks of civilizational disconnect, reflects a colonial holdover our minds, consequently our legal framework

## GANDHI'S VIEWS ON LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE (87:00)

### Skeptical Approach

- **GANDHI's Position**: Skeptical about the power of law to bring about change in society
- **Core Belief**: Law alone cannot bring about changes in society or reforms
- **Requirement**: It has to be accompanied by a change of heart

### Cow Protection Example

- **Gandhi's Support**: Very strong believer in cow protection due to his Hindu identity and Sanatani beliefs
- **Opposition to Legislation**: Equally strongly opposed to legislation banning cow slaughter
- **Alternative Approach**: If Hindus want Muslims not to slaughter the cow, they should effect a change of heart among Muslims, win over the Muslims, convince the Muslims but not through the power of law

### Law vs Justice

- **Key Principle**: Law and justice are not synonymous
- **Reality**: There can be unjust laws
- **Nature of Law**: Law can be a tool of justice, it can equally be a tool of injustice
- **Unjust Laws**: Are a species of violence

### Civil Disobedience Philosophy

- **Highest Court**: There is a court higher than the highest court of justice - the court of one's own conscience
- **Citizens' Duty**: 
  - Have a duty to obey just laws
  - Have an equal duty to disobey unjust laws
- **Moral Obligation**: Citizens have a moral duty to obey just laws and disobey unjust laws

## NEHRU'S VIEWS ON CONSTITUTION (95:17)

### Sacred vs Dead Institutions

- **NEHRU's Quote**: "In India, if you want to kill something, you make it sacred"
- **Implication**: If you want to kill the Constitution, you make it sacred
- **Sacred meaning**: Blind devotion beyond the pale of criticism, something which cannot be touched as if the word of God

### Importance of Adaptability

- **Risk of sacredness**: Why will it die if it becomes sacred?
- **Answer**: Because then it will not be adapted to the changing situations
- **Consequence**: Eventually it will become outdated, redundant and gradually become irrelevant

### Indian Constitution's Flexibility

- **Assessment**: There is a fair degree of flexibility
- **Federal provisions**: Have been given a sense of rigidity requiring states' approval
- **Most provisions**: Can be amended
- **Evidence**: Has already been amended more than 100 times since enactment
- **Status**: One of the lengthiest and most frequently amended constitutions in the world

### Living Document Concept

- **Nature**: Indian Constitution is a living document
- **Growth**: Over the past 70 years has grown and thrived
- **Adaptation**: Like a person grows from child to adult to old, our Constitution is also growing and aging

## AMBEDKAR'S VIEWS ON CONSTITUTION (101:09)

### Robust Framework

- **AMBEDKAR's Assessment**: The Indian Constitution provides a very robust framework to organize the socio-political life of people in India
- **Pride**: "I feel that the Constitution is workable"

### Responsibility for Failure

- **AMBEDKAR's Quote**: "If things go wrong under the new Constitution, the reason will not be that we had a bad Constitution. We will have to say that man was vile"
- **Meaning**: If the Constitution doesn't work, the fault lies with those who implement it, not with the Constitution itself

### Commitment to Reform

- **AMBEDKAR's Declaration**: "If I find that the Constitution is being misused, I will be the first to burn it"
- **Context**: Just like he burnt MANUSMRITI, he would burn his own Constitution if misused
- **Indicates**: Constitutional and legal frameworks can be potentially subverted and misused

### Example of Misuse

- **Emergency Provisions**: Were well-meaning but were misused during INDIRA GANDHI's time
- **Pattern**: Emergency provisions have been misused numerous times by various political parties

## UNIFORM CIVIL CODE (UCC) - DETAILED ANALYSIS (114:01)

### Background and Definition

- **Current Status**: Topical issue, in the air
- **Reason for Discussion**: Part of the core ideological agenda of BJP
- **Three Core Items**: 
  1. Ram Mandir construction ✓
  2. Abrogation of Article 370 ✓  
  3. UCC (pending)

#### What is UCC?

- **Current System**: Different personal laws for different religious communities
- **Personal Laws cover**: Marriage, divorce, property inheritance, child custody, adoption
- **UCC Definition**: Will create a common set and uniform set of personal laws for all religious communities

### Historical Development

#### Early Demands (1937)

- **First Demand**: Made at All India Women's Conference in 1937
- **Constituent Assembly**: Several women's voices demanding UCC
- **Leading Feminists**: 
  - RAJKUMARI AMRIT KAUR
  - HANSA MEHTA  
  - MEENU MASANI
- **Their Demand**: UCC should be made a Fundamental Right

#### AMBEDKAR's Strong Support

- **Position**: One of the strongest proponents of UCC
- **Opposition**: Strongly opposed giving any space to religion in personal matters
- **Belief**: Religious norms, customs should not dictate inheritance, marriage, divorce, maintenance
- **Rationale**: Our social structure is full of grave inequalities, and religions/customs typically deny women freedom and equality

#### Constitutional Outcome

- **Result**: Incorporated as Directive Principle of State Policy (Article 44), not as Fundamental Right
- **Status**: Non-justiciable directive principle
- **Implementation**: Has been largely a dead letter for all practical purposes till now

### Hindu Code Bill (1950)

- **Nature**: A step in the direction of UCC
- **Content**: Reformed various Hindu personal laws
- **Parliamentary Debate**: Very acrimonious debates
- **Supporters**: AMBEDKAR, NEHRU (threatened to resign if not passed)
- **Opposition**: 
  - Hindu Mahasabha
  - Orthodox Hindus  
  - Conservative sections within Congress
  - DR. RAJENDRA PRASAD (said it would divide all families)

#### Outcome

- **Final Result**: Bill was passed but with amendments - major provisions opposed by traditionalists were dropped
- **AMBEDKAR's Response**: Resigned because bill was passed in much diluted form

### Contemporary UCC Debate

#### Arguments in Favor of UCC

| Argument                   | Details                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gender Justice**         | Core argument - personal laws (particularly Muslim) are discriminatory towards women with practices like polygamy, nikah halala |
| **National Integration**   | Separate personal laws breed separateness; should have common laws like for criminal matters                                    |
| **Secularism**             | UCC necessary for secularism - state should not discriminate between citizens on basis of religion                              |
| **Constitutional Mandate** | Article 44 makes it a directive principle; state should implement like other DPSPs                                              |
| **Modernization**          | Will help modernization of society, especially Muslims who remain stuck in past due to religion-inspired personal laws          |

#### State Reform Record

- **Hindu Laws**: Indian state has sufficiently used its power to reform Hindu personal laws
- **Other Communities**: Should also benefit from state intervention and reform as equal citizens

#### Arguments Against UCC

| Opposition Source                       | Main Arguments                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **All India Muslim Personal Law Board** | Will deny Muslims constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion under Article 25; violates spirit of Indian secularism |
| **Religious Minorities**                | Will lead to imposition of majority community's lifestyle and culture over minorities; threat to cultural diversity      |
| **Some Feminists**                      | Focus has shifted from Hindu personal laws (earlier) to targeting Muslim personal laws (now)                             |

#### Feminist Divide on UCC

##### Historical Position

- **1937 to mid-1980s**: Indian feminists were strongly in favor of UCC
- **Mid-1980s onwards**: Became divided on the issue

##### Reasons for Change

- **Shah Bano Case**: Key turning point
- **Rise of Hindutva**: Political rise of Hindutva made many feminists disassociate from UCC demand
- **Fear**: UCC will be used to target Muslims

##### Current Feminist Positions

**Pro-UCC Feminists (e.g., SAHELI)**:

- Should not give up UCC issue simply because it coincides with right-wing agenda
- Should be steadfast in support because it benefits women

**Anti-UCC Feminists (e.g., NIVEDITA MENON)**:

- Muslim personal law is already quite progressive in many ways
- Marriage is contractual in nature where women are party to contract
- Women have right to grant divorce, right to maintenance (meher)
- Polygamy more prevalent among Hindus than Muslims
- UCC is only a tool in hands of Hindutva forces to demonize Muslims

**FLAVIA AGNES's Position**:

- UCC will be problematic not just for Muslims but for other communities as well
- Different communities' personal laws have different progressive provisions
- When looked at from gender justice angle, all personal laws have some progressive elements and some regressive elements

### Alternative Solutions Proposed

#### Option 1: Implement UCC

- **Supporters**: Organizations like SAHELI, PUDR
- **Approach**: Should be implemented without thinking about political outcomes

#### Option 2: Optional Gender Just Code

- **Mechanism**: 
  - Under normal circumstances, respective personal laws will prevail
  - In case women face discrimination, they will have option to seek grievance redressal under gender just code
- **Example**: If Muslim daughter feels cheated in inheritance, she can file appeal under gender just code

#### Option 3: Reform Personal Laws

- **FLAVIA AGNES's Suggestion**: Instead of imposing one uniform law, reform personal laws of various communities to make them gender just
- **Objective**: Uniformity of rights rather than uniform law
- **Benefit**: Any reform from within community will not be perceived as encroachment

#### Option 4: Reform from Within

- **Issue**: If state does it, seen as infringement on religious freedom
- **Problem**: Left to Muslims for seven decades with zero progress
- **Reality**: Muslim orthodoxy not interested in reforms; Muslim women under patriarchal clutches

### Survey Evidence

- **Source**: Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan
- **Finding**: More than 90% Indian Muslim women favored prohibition on triple talaq and polygamy within Muslim personal law

### Current Status

- **Law Commission**: Has started discussions on UCC implementation
- **BJP-ruled States**: Several have declared intent to implement UCC
  - Uttarakhand (implementing by January)
  - Haryana, Gujarat, MP, Himachal Pradesh, Assam
- **Opposition**: Three state assemblies passed resolutions against UCC (Nagaland, Kerala, Mizoram)

## PREETAM SINGH'S CRITIQUE: HINDU BIAS IN INDIAN CONSTITUTION (53:33)

### Book Reference

- **Title**: "HINDU BIAS IN INDIAN CONSTITUTION"
- **Author**: PREETAM SINGH

### Evidence of Hindu Bias

#### Symbolic Elements

| Element                  | Hindu Bias Indicator                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Article 1**            | "India that is Bharat" - reference to pre-Muslim, pre-British ancient period of Hindu rule                |
| **Word "Union"**         | Used instead of "Federation" to strengthen center and weaken states, favoring Hindu majority              |
| **Constitution Imagery** | Full of Hindu imagery by artist NANDLAL BOSE - Ram, Sita, Lakshman, Krishna giving Gita to Arjuna, Natraj |
| **National Motto**       | "Satyamev Jayate" from Upanishads                                                                         |

#### First State Action

- **Somnath Temple Reconstruction**: One of first acts after independence was reconstruction of Somnath Temple (plundered by Muslims multiple times)

#### Article 25 Analysis

- **Clause 2(b)**: State can make laws for social welfare and reform and throwing open of Hindu religious institutions to all classes and sections of Hindus
- **Issue**: Why should secular state be concerned about reform of only one particular religion?
- **Explanation**: Includes Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists under Hindu definition - indicates Hindu assimilative agenda

#### Directive Principles

- **Article 48**: Champions cow protection, clearly derives from Hindu reverence for cow as sacred animal
- **Note**: Cow is not revered by Muslims, Dalits, Christians

#### Language Provisions

- **Article 343**: Important status to Hindi in Devanagari script as official language
- **Article 351**: Promotion of Hindi, preference for Sanskrit sources over other languages
- **Devanagari preference**: Over Kaithi script (which was more popular) because Devanagari was closer to Brahmanical Hinduism

#### Sanskrit Special Status

- **Eighth Schedule**: Sanskrit listed despite having only about 25,000 speakers
- **Exclusions**: Many tribal languages with more speakers (Bhili - 1.25 million, Mundari - 1.1 million, Khasi - 1 million) not included
- **Significance**: Sanskrit is the language of Hindu scriptures

### Implications

- **PREETAM SINGH's Conclusion**: Constitution has clear pro-Hindu bias
- **Broader Impact**: Acknowledging this bias reveals that Hindutva is widespread and deeply rooted, not confined to Sangh Parivar
- **Institutional Effect**: Indicates institutionalized communalism in India springing from Constitution and manifesting in various state and societal institutions
