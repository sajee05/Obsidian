# Demography, Census, and India's Population - Lecture Notes

## INTRODUCTION AND FEDERALISM RECAP (18:19)

- **Previous lecture discussion**: Federalism and Philosophies
- **Federalism definition**: When power is divided between the center as well as constituent units
- **Nature of Indian Federalism**: Both unitary and federal characteristics

### Unitary Features of Indian Constitution

- Power of the center to impose President's rule in the states
- Single citizenship
- Parliament law prevails over state law whenever there is a conflict between central and state law
- Governor's office represents central power in the states

### Federal Features of Indian Constitution

- Rajya Sabha represents a federal feature
- State legislatures can empower the center
- Separation of powers between legislature, executive and judiciary (division of powers between center and states)
- State list and central list - clear demarcation
- Independent judiciary is a federal feature

### Political Philosophies Discussed

- **Nehru's Fabian Socialism**: Emphasis on reducing inequalities through gradual reforms rather than complete state control (different from Marxist socialism)
- **Gandhi's Philosophy**: Emphasis on non-violence (ahimsa), people-centric governance, decentralization, ideal social situation termed as "Ramrajya"
- **Humanism by M.N. Roy**: Radical humanism influenced Nehru's secularism with emphasis on rationality and scientific thinking

## DEMOGRAPHY - DEFINITION AND IMPORTANCE (27:19)

- **Demography definition**: Demos (people) + graphy (study) = Study of the people
- **Alternative term**: Population studies
- **Scope**: Study and analysis of various characteristics of a population

### Most Important Source of Information

- **The Census**: Far more than a mere head count of the population
- **Comprehensive survey**: Collects very rich and extensive data about various aspects of people's life
- **Coverage**: Various aspects of a society

## CENSUS - COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING (29:55)

### Why Government Should Spend on Census

- **Policy making assistance**: Helps in formulating targeted policies
- **Resource allocation**: Can allocate resources according to needs and population strength of different segments
- **Policy analysis**: To analyze policies and impact of policies
- **Example - Mid Day Meal**: Can analyze how many children are dropping out, benefit rates, targeting effectiveness

### Historical Background of Census in India

| Period         | Details                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ancient Period | Data collection practices mentioned in Kautilya's Arthashastra |
| Medieval Era   | Practices during Akbar's reign                                 |
| British Period | Modern census exercise began                                   |
| 1865-72        | First census conducted (non-synchronous)                       |
| 1881           | First synchronous census, conducted every 10 years since then  |

- **Non-synchronous vs Synchronous**: 
  - Non-synchronous: Data collection not done at same time everywhere (spread across 7 years)
  - Synchronous: Data collected across length and breadth of country almost at same time (during February month)

### Global Cost Comparison

- **Global average cost**: $4.6 per person for gathering census data
- **Indian cost**: $0.5 per person (very cost effective)
- **Upcoming 2021 Census**: Will be the first digitalized census

### Comprehensive Data Collection Areas

- Personal details (name, relationship to head, sex, date of birth, age)
- Marital status and age at marriage
- Religion, SC/ST status, disability status
- Mother tongue, other languages, literacy status
- Educational attendance and highest education level
- Occupation and work-related information
- Migration details (place of birth, last residence, duration of stay)
- Fertility characteristics (surviving children, children ever born)
- Housing conditions (roof type, water source, amenities, latrine facilities)

## POPULATION GROWTH PATTERNS IN INDIA (58:31)

### Historical Population Data

| Census Year | Total Population (Crores) | Population Change | Growth Rate | Annual Growth Rate  |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| 1901        | 24                        | -                 | -           | -                   |
| 1911        | 25.2                      | +1.37 crores      | 5.7%        | 0.5%                |

| 1951        | 36                        | -                 | -           | Max 1.33% till 1951 |
| 2001        | 102                       | -                 | -           | -                   |
| 2011        | 121                       | -                 | 1.64%       | 1.64%               |

### Key Observations from Population Data

- **1911-1921**: Only decade with negative growth due to Spanish Flu pandemic
- **1901-1951**: Population increased 1.5 times (slow pace in first 50 years)
- **1951-2011**: Population increased 2.5+ times (bulk of population increase after independence)
- **1951-1981**: Period of population explosion (growth rates: 1.9%, 2.2%, 2.2%)
- **Since 1981**: Gradual decline in population growth rate

### Population Explosion Period Analysis

- **1951 to 1981**: Period of population explosion
- **Three crucial decades**: Added huge chunk to population
- **Since 1981**: Gradual decline in population growth rate
  - 1981-91: 2.14%
  - 1991-2001: 1.95%  
  - 2001-2011: 1.62%

## THEORETICAL MODELS FOR POPULATION GROWTH (70:02)

## MALTHUSIAN THEORY (70:02)

### Thomas Malthus Background

- **Period**: 18th-19th centuries
- **India connection**: Used to teach civil servants at a college in London for training
- **Core argument**: Human population increases at faster pace than food supply

### Basic Malthusian Proposition

- **Population growth**: Geometric progression (2, 4, 8, 16...)
- **Food supply growth**: Arithmetic progression (2, 4, 6, 8...)
- **Inevitable result**: Food shortage due to imbalance

### Population Control Mechanisms

| Type                  | Definition                     | Examples                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preventive Checks** | Lead to decline in birth rate  | Contraceptive use, celibacy, late marriage, abortion |
| **Positive Checks**   | Lead to increase in death rate | Wars, pandemics, plagues, famines                    |

### Malthus's Prediction

- **Core statement**: "The power of population is so superior to the power of earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death in some form or other must visit the human race"
- **Implication**: Humanity is doomed to frequent large-scale elimination

### Criticism of Malthusian Theory

- **Technological advancement**: Green Revolution and food production technology advancement
- **Earth's capacity**: Has kept pace with increasing human population
- **Contemporary context**: Famines and plagues are now things of the past
- **Moral criticism**: Shelley criticized Malthus as "a priest, a eunuch and a tyrant"
- **Class bias**: Karl Marx called him "principal enemy of the people" and "paid advocate of the bourgeois"

## DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION THEORY (88:16)

### Theorists and Background

- **Developed by**: Frank Notestein and Warren Thompson
- **Key insight**: Economic growth and population growth affect each other
- **Relationship**: Economic condition greatly affects fertility behavior

### Four Stages of Demographic Transition

| Stage                                | Economic Level                        | Birth Rate | Death Rate    | Population Growth                | Population Size            |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Stage 1: Pre-Industrial**          | Basic technology, low economic output | High       | High          | Low/Static                       | Small & Stable             |
| **Stage 2: Early Industrialization** | Improving conditions                  | High       | Sharp decline | Very High (Population Explosion) | Growing rapidly            |
| **Stage 3: Later Industrialization** | Higher development                    | Declining  | Low           | Slowing down                     | Large but growing slowly   |
| **Stage 4: Advanced Development**    | High standard of living               | Low        | Low           | Low/Negative                     | Large but stable/declining |

### Reasons for Changes in Each Stage

**Stage 1 to Stage 2 Transition:**

- **Death rate declines** due to: Better food availability, improved health infrastructure, modern medicine availability
- **Birth rate remains high** because: Reproductive behavior is much slower to change

**Stage 2 to Stage 3 Transition:**

- **Birth rate declines** due to: Greater contraceptive adoption, economic burden awareness, shift from agriculture to industry, government awareness programs, reduction in infant mortality rate, girl child education, increase in age of marriage

**India's Current Position:**

- **Overall**: India is in Stage 3 as a country
- **Regional variations**: Some regions may be in Stage 2, wide regional variations exist

## BIMARU STATES CONCEPT (102:41)

### Origin and Definition

- **Coined by**: Ashish Bose in 1986
- **Acronym stands for**: Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh
- **Later addition**: Odisha (making it BIMARU)
- **Literal meaning**: "Bimar" (sick in Hindi) - referring to sick states of India

### BIMARU States Characteristics

- **Population share**: Together account for about 40% of India's total population
- **Development lag**: Lagging behind on various demographic and developmental parameters
- **Comparison**: Significantly lagging behind southern states

### Parameters Where BIMARU States Lag

- Low age of marriage
- High Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)
- High Maternal Mortality Rate
- High Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
- Low life expectancy
- Low economic growth
- Less adoption of family planning methods

### Current Relevance of BIMARU Tag

**Arguments for Continued Relevance (Vineeta Sharma's Study):**

- Recent study indicates BIMARU tag still holds good
- On half of 13 parameters used by Bose, BIMARU states have not converged with national average
- On some parameters, BIMARU states have diverged from national average
- None of the states have been able to come out of BIMARU grouping

**Improvements Noted:**

- Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have shown greater improvement than Bihar
- Development has occurred in some BIMARU states but they continue to lag significantly behind southern states

## EAG STATES (126:22)

### Background and Definition

- **Full form**: Empowered Action Group states
- **Reason for creation**: BIMARU nomenclature was found offensive by people of these states
- **Refashioned as**: EAG - sounds more respectable

### EAG States List

- **Original BIMARU**: Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh
- **Additional states**: Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Odisha
- **Total**: 8 EAG states
- **Non-EAG states**: Basically referring to southern states

### Population Growth Contribution Patterns

| Period         | EAG States                                                 | Non-EAG States              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **1951-1971**  | Population growth in both                                  | Population growth in both   |
| **After 1971** | Maintained high fertility                                  | Steady decline in fertility |
| **1971-1991**  | High decadal growth rate (about 25%)                       | Continued decline           |
| **2001-2011**  | First significant decline in growth rate (from 25% to 21%) | Continued decline           |

- **Combined effect**: Resulted in significant decline in population growth of country as a whole

## DAVIS AND BLAKE THEORY OF REPRODUCTION (142:17)

### Core Proposition

- **Key insight**: Biological process of reproduction is affected by socio-cultural factors at each and every stage
- **Scope**: Not exclusively human - happens across species, but human reproduction is culturally influenced

### Three Stages of Biological Reproduction

| Stage                       | Definition                               | Socio-Cultural Factors Affecting                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intercourse**             | Sexual act between male and female       | Age of marriage, societal attitudes toward separation/divorce, culturally approved periods of abstinence    |
| **Conception**              | Whether intercourse leads to child birth | Societal attitudes toward contraceptive use                                                                 |
| **Gestation & Parturition** | Nine-month period and birth process      | Societal attitudes toward abortion, female feticide, infanticide, availability of childbirth infrastructure |

### Examples of Socio-Cultural Influence

- **Voluntary abstinence**: Due to rituals and customs (e.g., "japa" period after childbirth)
- **Involuntary abstinence**: Due to illness or separation
- **Marriage patterns**: Age of entry into sexual union affects fertility
- **Contraceptive acceptance**: Varies across societies

### Overall Impact

- **Developed societies**: Various socio-cultural factors operate to result in low fertility rate
- **Developing societies**: Factors operate to result in higher fertility rate
- **Balance**: In any society, some factors increase fertility while others reduce it

## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO POPULATION GROWTH IN INDIA (156:49)

### Major Contributing Factors

- **Low contraceptive usage**
- **Poverty**: Economic conditions affect reproductive behavior
- **Male child preference**: Cultural preference leading to continued reproduction
- **Low literacy rates**: Particularly female literacy is crucial
- **High infant mortality rate**: People produce more children as insurance
- **Low age of marriage**: Earlier marriage leads to longer reproductive window
- **Overall socio-economic development level**: Less developed regions have higher fertility
- **Migration patterns**: Separation affects fertility behavior

### Female Literacy Impact

- **Key factor**: Female literacy particularly important in determining fertility behavior
- **Mechanism**: Education changes mindset and increases time investment in education
- **Result**: Educated women tend to have fewer children
