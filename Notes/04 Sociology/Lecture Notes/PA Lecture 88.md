# Political System, Decentralization and Federalism

## Review of Previous Lecture (02:42)

### Evolution of Indian Political Life

- In the last lecture, we had covered and begun with discussing the **evolution of Indian political life**
- We had spoken about and evaluated the **success and otherwise of Indian democracy**

### Nature of Indian Political Elites

- Earlier, the political elites were more about the **upper caste sections dominating** the nationalist movement and political parties
- The upper caste dominated Indian polity until about the **second phase**

**First Phase Characteristics:**

- Political elites were those who **led our freedom struggle**
- They were **modern educated and western** in outlook
- They had **liberal modern education** and were **upper caste**
- They were typically **city based**

**Second Phase Changes:**

- **Rural elites came up** who were **not westernized or liberal**
- They also spoke frequently in the **language of caste and religion**
- Due to regional political rise, **middle class** which are emerging in second phase started to have a say in the political scenario
- **Marginal sections** like those who get benefit of reservations emerged

### Assessment of Indian Democracy

According to **YOGENDRA YADAV**, Indian democracy has moved in phases with three main objectives:

**Three Objectives of Democracy:**

1. **Reducing inequalities**
2. **National integration** 
3. **Welfare of the masses** (well being of the masses)

**Performance Analysis:**

- In **reducing inequalities**: Indian state has successfully reduced inequalities like **caste inequalities** - caste inequality has been shaken up, but **gender inequality still prevails**
- In **national integration**: Indian state has successfully integrated all the states, though in some cases like **Sikh accords** there were challenges
- In **ensuring material well being**: According to YADAV, **Indian state has failed**

### Present State Analysis (Yogendra Yadav)

According to YOGENDRA YADAV's analysis of present Indian democracy:

- There is **majority rule**
- **Muslim exclusion** - exclusion of Muslims
- **Christians and Muslims** have been reduced to **second class citizen status**

## Democratic Decentralization and Federalism (09:47)

### Understanding Decentralization

- **Decentralization** means that the powers and responsibilities of government are **not vested only with the central government**, but are **transferred to elected authorities at the sub-national level**
- These authorities at sub-national level (both state and local government) **enjoy a certain degree of autonomy**

### Understanding Federalism

- **Federalism** is a mode of political organization in which there is **division of powers between the central authority and constituent units**
- According to **ROBERT INMAN AND DANIEL RUBINFELD**: **Democratic federalism** is a political system which **promotes individual liberties, economic efficiency, and encourages citizens participation**

### Nature of Indian Political System

**Constitutional Features - Federal Characteristics:**

- We have clearly **two levels of government** - the center and the states (now also third level)
- Both have their own **respective areas of authority**
- State governments are **not at the mercy of the center** and subordinated to the center
- They derive their **existence and powers from the constitution itself**
- We have an **independent judiciary** to adjudicate any disputes between the center and states
- We have **constitutionalism** meaning **supremacy of the constitution**
- We have the **first and second list** - the central and the state list clearly outlining distinctive areas of authority
- States also have **independent financial powers** meaning **power of taxation**

**Unitary Tendencies:**

- **Single citizenship**
- The constitution mentions **union instead of federation** - meaning no state has the right to secede
- **Single constitution**
- The **emergency powers**, particularly **Article 356**, which gives the union the powers to dismiss state governments
- The fact that the **executive head of the state is appointed by the union** which is the **governor**
- The **governor's office** and the **All India Services**
- The center can **divide India into North India and South India** without any reference to the states
- The center can **unilaterally without any reference change the area boundaries and name of the states**
- The fact that the **judiciary is integrated** - the High Court is clearly officially subordinated to the Supreme Court
- **Residuary powers lie with the center**
- If there is any clash between a law made by the parliament and the state's state legislature, the **parliament one prevails**
- The states are **practically dependent on the center for finances** - the **financial muscle of the center is far stronger** than that of the states

**Supreme Court Declaration:**

- The Supreme Court has stated that **federalism is a part of the basic structure** of the Indian constitution
- The **federal character of Indian polity** can be traced to the colonial period to the **Government of India Acts 1919** and all of that
- Clearly **pre-independence origins of Indian federalism**

### Political Context and Federalism

According to **YOGENDRA YADAV**:

- The **federal character of Indian polity** is determined **not just by the constitutional provisions** but is also **greatly affected by the political situation**
- Constitutional provisions have remained broadly the same since long, but **how truly federal** it is in character is **more dependent on the political situation**

**General Rule:**

- A **strong center** means **weak federalism**
- A **weak center** bodes well for **federalism**
- Whenever the center is strong, **federalism is compromised**
- Whenever the center is weak, **federalism is strengthened**

| Phase            | Period              | Political Character                           | Federal Strength    | Key Features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First Phase**  | Nehru Period        | Congress System - Defacto party of governance | **Weak Federalism** | • Same party ruled center and most states<br>• Central leadership towered over state level Congress leaders<br>• Overall vision of development set by central leadership<br>• State chief ministers were regarded as Nehru's lieutenants<br>• Nehru used to regularly write letters to chief ministers putting forth his vision for national progress                                                                                                                                             |
| **Second Phase** | Indira-Rajiv Period | Mixed developments                            | **Mixed Impact**    | **Good for Federalism:**<br>• Congress monopoly in states challenged by regional parties<br>• Non-Congress parties captured power in many states<br>• States would assert their autonomy and independent decision making<br><br>**Bad for Federalism:**<br>• Strong centralizing tendencies (Emergency period)<br>• Concentration of power in office and person of Prime Minister<br>• Wide frequent misuse of Article 356<br>• Indira Gandhi dismissed many opposition led governments in states |
| **Third Phase**  | 1990-2014           | Coalition Governments                         | **Golden Period**   | • Center was very weak - no single party had clear mandate<br>• Era of coalition governments<br>• Main ruling party depended on regional parties' political support to stay in power<br>• Regional parties able to extract their pound of flesh - secured important ministries in center<br>• Supreme Court laid down guidelines to prevent misuse of Article 356<br>• Misuse of 356 has significantly reduced                                                                                    |

### Current Phase Assessment

**Positive Developments under Modi:**

- Under the **14th Finance Commission**, the share of states in the **divisible pool of taxes has been increased from 32% to 42%** - substantial increase indicating greater financial autonomy
- **Planning Commission was abolished** and replaced by **NITI Ayog**
- Planning Commission indicated the financial control of the center over the states - CMs would literally stand with begging bowl outside the Planning Commission office during Nehruvian period
- **NITI Ayog** which has replaced Planning Commission is more in the nature of **think tank** - it is expected to encourage **cooperative federalism**

**Concerns regarding Federal Character:**

- **State elections** including the present ones are regularly being fought by the ruling party under the **name of the Prime Minister** rather than having CM face
- Similar kind of **political centralization** that we had in the Nehru era
- The present day political leadership towers far above the state CMs - **state chief ministers are literally handpicked by the central high command**
- The **central agencies are being misused** against political opponents in the states like **ED, CBI** etc.
- Some of the central schemes like **Swachh Bharat Abhiyan** and **Jal Jeevan Mission** impinge upon the areas of the states and municipalities
- The center is **venturing into the areas which rightfully belong to the states and municipalities**
- There is increasing talk of **one nation one election**
- They openly ask votes in name of **double engine sarkar** - that if you give at state level also it will be beneficial, otherwise there will be loss

## Panchayati Raj System (46:16)

### Historical Background

- **Village panchayats have existed since ages** - it's not a new concept
- Colonial administrators called **Indian villages as little republics** - they enjoyed a certain degree of political autonomy where the panchayat performed quasi-judicial administrative kind of functions
- **Colonial rule destroyed** the village level autonomy and the **self-sufficiency and autonomy of Indian villages**
- However, some steps were also taken to promote local self-governance by **LORD RIPON**
- **BAPU** also said that **Swaraj is Gram Swaraj** - Bapu equated Swaraj with Gram Swaraj

### Post-Independence Development

- After independence, the growth of panchayati raj was **uneven** and **depended on the will of the states** - it was left to the state governments
- In some states, panchayati raj saw better development than others
- In the constitution, the **promotion of panchayati raj was mentioned as a Directive Principle** of state policy - **non-justiciable**
- It was largely dependent on the states and therefore **uneven** - by and large the state governments were **unwilling to devolve powers** to a lower level or to the local governments

### Constitutional Amendments

- **73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts** were passed in **1992**
- These added **whole chapters for panchayati raj and urban local bodies**
- The **11th and 12th schedules** were also added listing their areas of work
- **State Election Commission** should be there to oversee free elections
- **Gram Sabha** was mentioned
- **State Finance Commission** should be constituted
- **Minimum one-third reservation for women**
- **Reservation for SCs and STs**
- **Five yearly elections**

### Assessment of Panchayati Raj Performance

**Students' Experiences from Various States:**

**Chhattisgarh Experience:**

- Local sarpanch now conducts Republic Day and Independence Day functions at schools instead of principals
- Symbolically telling that power has shifted from educationists to elected sarpanches

**Bihar Experience (Jalabpur):**

- Issues with **Mukhiya-Mukheiyani** system
- Money for toilet construction is used by **dominant families** - it doesn't reach the intended beneficiaries
- Different family names are shown but money doesn't reach them directly
- Only few people take the money and direct benefit transfer is not happening properly
- **Favoritism in favor of dominant families**

**West Bengal Experience:**

- **Panchayati raj elections** witness significant levels of bloodshed
- More violence than state and national elections - which indicates the **growing importance of panchayati raj bodies** and **corruption within it**
- In some areas, **female head** (Pradhan) actually manages everything herself
- **Deputy Pradhan** who is male **succumbs to her authority**
- She is actually undertaking **developmental work** - handpumps available in every locality, roads being completed, water filters being implemented
- **Minority community** areas receiving more development (political agenda of minority appeasement)

**Western UP Experience:**

- **Zilla Panchayat elections** involve lot of money changing hands
- To become **Zilla Panchayat Adhyaksh**, substantial amount has to be transferred for buying votes
- **2000 crore** allocation for developmental works as Zilla Panchayat Adhyaksh vs **5 crore** MP LAD fund
- In some cases, people leave **MLA tickets** to contest for Zilla Panchayat Adhyaksh because it's more lucrative
- Total electorate around **5000 people** mostly elected representatives and government teachers

**Ayodhya Experience:**

- **16 villages** in the Gram Sabha with **300 voters each**
- Substantial developmental work has been done
- **Beneficiary gets money only after doing half the work** - then gets stuck and has to grease palms to get remaining funds

**Tribal Areas:**

- Panchayats have really empowered the **tribals** and given them a say against encroachment on their lands
- This was after the **Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas Act 1996** (PESA)
- Panchayat **funds pass smoothly** because work is very micro-level
- Both legal and illegal funding is substantial and happening on substantial scale

### Positive Impacts According to Yogendra Yadav

**Deepening of Indian Democracy:**

- Panchayati raj has **further contributed to the deepening of Indian democracy** because it has **involved ordinary people in politics**
- Panchayati raj has led to the **political education of the masses**
- It has **altered the relationship between the people and the state**

**Changed State-Citizen Relationship:**

- Earlier, state representatives were seen as **very distant, powerful, and unapproachable**
- There was a lot of **Mai Baap culture** in our politics
- Representatives of government appeared **all powerful, very distant and very unapproachable**
- **Panchayati raj has brought the state next door literally**
- **Sarpanch and panchayat members are far closer, far more approachable, far less intimidating**
- The state earlier was **very intimidating**

**Enhanced Participation:**

- It has made **Indian democracy more participatory**
- It has ensured **people's greater participation** not just in politics but also in **developmental activities**
- It has **empowered people at the grass roots level**
- In Gram Sabha, you can express your views on the developmental agenda for your village

### Challenges and Issues

**According to T.K. OOMMEN:**

- In much of **South India**, PRIs have been **quite effective bodies of local governance**

**Issues in North India:**

- The functioning of panchayati raj is **greatly affected by caste conflicts**
- Village level political empowerment of lower castes is **not easily acceptable to the higher castes**
- This leads to caste conflicts

**According to GAIL OMVEDT:**

- **Reservation for Scheduled Caste in panchayat** is **considered unacceptable by the upper caste**
- Reports of **upper caste preventing dalits from casting their votes** in panchayat elections
- **Upper caste preventing a dalit sarpanch from hoisting the national flag**

**According to YOGENDRA SINGH (study of panchayati raj in Bulandshahr, UP):**

- **Elections are held regularly**
- **People enthusiastically participate in these elections**
- But the panchayati raj elections are **typically fought between members of one or two dominant castes**
- The **ability of the panchayat to carry out developmental works greatly depends on its relationship with local bureaucracy** - this becomes very crucial

**Women's Empowerment Issues:**

- Despite mandatory reservation for women in panchayat, what MODI JI termed as **"Sarpanch-pati raj"** exists
- However, there are signs of **women actively participating** and political sensitization of women is increasing

## Political Philosophies of Modern India (92:21)

### Gandhi's Political Philosophy (93:03)

**Core Principles:**

- Gandhi's political philosophy was an **extension of his social and moral philosophy**
- Gandhi was a **firm believer in Ahimsa (non-violence)**
- For him, **the state represents violence in concentrated and organized form**
- According to Gandhi, **the state is an instrument of violence**
- Since Gandhi was a firm believer in non-violence, **Gandhi was against the state**
- Gandhi is therefore **widely regarded as an anarchist**

**Ideal State Concept:**

- Gandhi believed in a **stateless society**
- Gandhi's ideal state was **Ram Rajya**
- **Ram Rajya** in Gandhian understanding was based on a **self-regulating society** where **everybody is following his and her duties**
- So there is **no need for a state** because everyone is committed to fulfilling his and her duties

**Practical Approach:**

- Gandhi was also **pragmatic** - he was a practical man and living breathing politician
- **As long as the state exists, it has to be fully democratic in character**
- As long as the state does exist, **it must be under full democratic control**
- Gandhi was **against a centralized state**
- Gandhi was in favor of and a **strong votary of decentralization of power**

**Democracy and Tolerance:**

- **Democracy must be based on tolerance**
- In public life you are bound to encounter opposition - those who hold a different view than yours
- You **win over the opponents through patience and moral persuasion**
- You convince them **by dialogue and discussion**
- You convince them **by ensuring a change of heart**
- **Democracy only thrives in an atmosphere of tolerance**

**Democratic Principles:**

- **Democracy should not mean majority rule**
- The **rights of the minorities must be respected**

**Sarvdoday Philosophy:**

- **Sarvdoaya** literally means **the uplift of all**
- In democracy, the **weakest member should have equal opportunities as the strongest member**
- **Democracy for Gandhi means Sarvdoaya** - fostering an environment where the weakest member of the society can thrive and has equal opportunities as the strongest members

**Impact on Indian Politics:**

- Gandhian emphasis on **decentralization and Gram Swaraj** is translated into the **73rd and 74th constitutional amendments**
- Many Gandhi elements in DPSPs whether cow protection or alcohol prohibition or promotion of village industries
- Gandhi made the **Congress party a mass-based political party** and movement
- Gandhi had a very on-the-ground impact
- **Gandhian methods** are widely used till this date - whether public fasting, undertaking march (Bharat Jodo Yatra)
- Various civil society organizations and farmers used Gandhian methods of **Satyagraha**
- They inform our **welfare orientation** influenced by the notion and idea of **Sarvdoaya**

### Nehru's Political Philosophy (106:03)

**Role and Context:**

- Nehru was the **chief architect of modern India**
- His political philosophy and vision has had a **far greater bearing on independent India** than even that of the **father of the nation**
- When Nehru came to power (mid-20th century), many other countries also became independent
- Many of those countries and people who came to power **clung to power** - they became **authoritarian or autocratic regimes**
- But Nehru in stark contrast was a **thorough democrat** - he was a **committed democrat**

**Democratic Framework:**

- His idea of democracy was the **western liberal democratic political framework** which he saw to implement in India
- **Western liberal democratic framework** includes:
  - **Multiplicity of political parties**
  - **Universal adult franchise** 
  - **Regular elections**
  - **Independent judiciary**
  - **Vibrant civil society**

**Constitutional Establishment:**

- The **Nehru state firmly entrenched various democratic conventions**
- It formally put in place **various democratic conventions** whether it is:
  - **Freedom of the press**
  - **Respect for opposition**
  - **Autonomous institutions**

**Economic Philosophy - Fabian Socialism:**

- Nehru believed in **Fabian Socialism**
- It is called Fabian socialism because there was a society in England called the **Fabian Society**
- **Fabian Socialist philosophy** focuses on:
  - **Reduction of inequalities**
  - **Preventing the concentration of wealth in few hands**
  - **Establishment of a welfare state**

**Role of State:**

- How do you establish a welfare state? **Through the democratic route**
- A **welfare state has to be established democratically**
- In stark contrast to Bapu, **Chacha trusted the state**
- Nehru envisaged the state playing a **central role in development**
- The state he envisaged playing a **very key role in development through centralized planning**

**Impact on India:**

- His impact was **the most decisive** - it has **determined and shaped our developmental trajectory** till at least the **economic reforms of early 1990s**
- The **developmental path of the Indian state** was clearly **dictated by the Nehru vision** till economic liberalization
- **Nehru laid down a very strong foundation for Indian democracy** - whether independent election commission, freedom of press, opposition's role, debate and discussions
- Nehru was **at the helm during the most formative years** of our life as a republic
- His developmental and political philosophy is **clearly visible in our social, political and economic life**
- It was **Nehru and secularism** which guided the **inter-community relations** (Hindu-Muslim relations) after independence

**Limitations:**

- Nehru **tried to imitate the western model of democracy** but **Indian society being very different from the western one**
- We adopted their procedures and institutions but Nehru had hoped that as **democracy gets strength in India, traditional identities like caste will die out** but **that has not happened**

### Ambedkar's Political Philosophy (116:01)

**Disagreement with Gandhi:**

- Ambedkar **strongly disagreed with Gandhi's vision of Gram Swaraj**
- He did not have this **romantic view of re-establishing the autonomy of the village and rural community**
- Ambedkar preferred the **individual as the unit in the constitutional scheme**, not the **village community**
- In the constitutional scheme, **the individual being the primary unit** instead of the village community
- Our constitution is **all about the rights of the individual** - **individual centric constitution**

**Difference from Nehru:**

- Ambedkar's vision also differed in significant ways from that of Nehru
- According to Ambedkar, **Nehru's vision was based on the western liberal framework**
- So it focused **only on political equality**
- Following western democracies, **Nehru stressed only on political equality**

**Buddhist Influence:**

- **Ambedkar's political understanding and vision of democracy** was **far more influenced not by western liberal democracy but by Buddhist Sangha** organization

**Unlike Marx:**

- **Ambedkar believed that democracy can help bring about revolutionary changes in the society**
- **Democracy can bring about revolutionary changes in the society without bloodshed**
- **Ambedkar unlike Marx never advocated the use of violence** not by dalits or any disadvantaged segment of the society

**Conditions for Democracy:**

- Ambedkar was of the view that **democracy cannot flourish everywhere**
- He said **democracy is not a plant which grows in every soil**
- You need **certain conditions for democracy to flourish**

**Constitutional Morality:**

- One condition is **constitutional morality**
- **Constitutional morality** means **following the constitution not only in letter but also in spirit**
- **Following the constitution not only in letter but also in spirit** translates into:
  - **Proper implementation** - it should not only mention in the constitution but implementation has to be done by the state and government
  - **People must believe in the constitution and its values** - not just follow it because it is the law of the land, but something which I as a person also subscribe to
  - My thinking is aligned with the **values and principles enshrined in the constitution**
  - As an individual citizen **I should believe in equality**
- It also means that **people must have respect for constitutional authorities** - people should have respect for constitutional authorities, otherwise they will not obey them
- There must be **equal treatment of citizens in everyday administration**
- It means **people must adhere to constitutional methods** to achieve their **socio-economic political objectives**

**No Hero Worship:**

- Ambedkar said there should be **no hero worship**
- Ambedkar famously said that **"Bhakti in religion is the road to salvation. But bhakti in politics is a sure road to dictatorship and degradation"**
- He said people should **never lay down their liberties at the feet of great man**
- In India there is this tendency to **elevate political leaders to exemplary kind of unattainable kind of high status**
- But he warned against **laying down your liberty at the feet of great man**
- Because **great man with their great big feet will trample upon your liberties**
- Always be willing as ordinary citizens to **question those in power no matter how charismatic**
- **Never follow anybody blindly**

**Social and Economic Democracy:**

- Third thing needed is **social and economic democracy**
- According to Ambedkar, a **democratic polity can only thrive in a democratic society**
- **Mere political equality is meaningless if not accompanied by socio-economic equality**
- That is what is wrong with the western liberal framework and the **Nehruvian philosophy - it emphasizes only on political equality**
- What we need along with that is **social and economic equality**

### M.N. Roy's Radical Humanism (129:20)

**Background:**

- M.N. Roy was the **founder of the Communist Party of India** and the **Communist Party of Mexico**
- He was personally **very close to Lenin** (the Russian leader)
- In **1940 he parted ways with communism** - he became disillusioned with communist philosophy and **chalked out a new philosophy of Radical Humanism**

**Critique of Both Systems:**

- **Roy was critical of both capitalism and communism**
- **Why critical of capitalism?** - The individual is **greatly exploited in a capitalist framework** - capitalism is clearly exploitative
- **Why critical of communism?** - In communism, the **individual is reduced to a non-entity**
- In communist countries, **an all-powerful state enslaves the individual**

**Alternative Philosophy:**

- **You need an alternative to both capitalism and communism** which will **liberate the individual**
- His emphasis throughout his philosophy is on **the individual**
- You need an alternative which **respects the freedom of the individual** and **ensures the progress of the individual**

**Individual-Centric Approach:**

- For Roy, **the amount of freedom available to the individual is the best indicator of social progress**
- For Roy, **the individual is the end** and **any social arrangement is to serve that end** and **to serve the individual**
- The individual is the end and any social arrangements (whether family, state, economy) **are to serve the individual and benefit the individual**

**Critique of Religion:**

- Roy was highly **critical of religion**
- He said **religion is a dogma** - it is a **mindless belief in the supernatural**
- It is **against the freedom of the individual**
- Particularly Roy **rejected religion as the basis of morality**
- Instead he **proposed radical humanism as an alternative rooted in a secular ideology**

**Decentralization:**

- Roy also **championed decentralization through people's committees**

**Impact on India:**

- The **Nehruvian secular secularism** model that we have adopted has in its agenda the **promotion of scientific temper and rational thinking** which has been **influenced by radical humanism**
- Aspects of **Nehru's secularism as practiced in India** show influence of radical humanist thought in **promoting scientific temper and rational thinking**, **discouraging superstition and meaningless rituals**

### Ram Manohar Lohia's Philosophy (141:40)

**Background:**

- Lohia is **considered as the last of original political thinkers that India has produced**
- He **outlined Indian Socialist thought**

**Critique of Foreign Models:**

- Lohia was **critical of both capitalism and communism**
- These philosophies - **both these models have been developed in the West** and therefore **they are not fully applicable to other parts of the world, especially India**
- **Capitalist and communist models both are foreign** and therefore **alien to us**

**On Capitalism:**

- **Capitalism is necessarily accompanied by colonialism**
- Since given the international geopolitics, **third world countries like India cannot have colonies**, they **cannot develop along capitalism or capitalist lines**
- Since **we can't have colonies, therefore we cannot have full-fledged capitalism**
- Why is capitalism necessarily accompanied by colonialism? You need **resource extraction** at a mindless kind of incessant uninhibited resource extraction from colonies

**On Communism:**

- **Communism is also not the answer**
- Lohia was of the view that **capitalism and communism are not too different from each other** in some respects - **they are quite similar**
- How? **Both are based on heavy industrialization**
- **Both are based on a centralized economic mechanism** - even in capitalism, economic power was centralized in the big corporates
- **Both are based on mass production** involving big machinery

**Indian Socialism as Solution:**

- The answer lies in **Indian Socialism**
- **Indian Socialism can help create a world without injustice**

**Seven Revolutions:**

- The problem with other philosophies is that they focus almost solely on **economic inequality**
- But **in India you have various forms of inequality** - each of which **requires a separate revolution**
- He talks about **seven revolutions**:

| Revolution Number | Target                                        | Purpose                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1                 | **Economic injustice**                        | Address economic inequality          |
| 2                 | **Caste system**                              | Eliminate caste-based discrimination |

### V.D. Savarkar's Philosophy (151:03)

**Civilizational State Concept:**

- Savarkar **envisages India as a civilizational state**
- This phrase has **come in vogue again** - being used by external affairs minister and others
- It is part of the **Hindutva view** - they see **India as a civilizational state**

**Not British Creation:**

- As per Savarkar, **India is not an outcome of British imperialism** - **it's not the British who created India**
- The **Indian nation has ancient roots in the civilizational past**

**Akhand Bharat:**

- Savarkar endorsed **M.K. MUNSHI's idea of Akhand Bharat** (United and indivisible India)

**Social Unity for Patriotism:**

- According to Savarkar, **patriotism has to be based on social unity**
- **Political unity can come later** - what is far more important is **social unity**
- **Politically we will get united only if we are united as a society**
- That is why the **RSS throughout its life has emphasized on social unity** from its perspective
- It considers **politics as relatively secondary**

**Against Caste System:**

- Savarkar personally was **against caste system and untouchability** because they **weaken the social unity**
- He was also **in favor of promoting Hindi as the national language** - the idea is again to **foster unity in the society**

**Savarkar's World View Emphasizes:**

- **Civilizational state**
- **Ethnic nationhood** 
- **Secularism** ⭐ (This seems contradictory to typical understanding of Hindutva ideology, may need verification)

**Clarification on Hindutva vs Pakistan Ideology:**

- Often opponents of Hindutva ideology argue that it is the **mirror opposite of Pakistan ideology**
- That Pakistan ideology emphasized on a **separate nation for Muslims**, likewise **Hindutva talks about a separate nation for Hindus**
- This is a **misreading and misunderstanding of Hindutva ideology**
- **Indian Muslims are very much a part of the country** - speaking from a Hindutva perspective
- But the **emphasis is on Indianness** rather than harping on **foreign origins and foreign descent**
- Hindutva and Savarkarite world view emphasize on **Akhand Bharat**
- They were **vehemently opposed to partition till the last**
- Even when Congress had reluctantly agreed (Gandhi who had said "partition over my dead body" and the whole Congress leadership had agreed to partition), the **Hindutva ideologues were vehemently opposed to it till the last**
- They **considered Muslims as part of the nation**, albeit a **mal-adjusted part of the nation**
- They wanted to **treat Muslims fitting into the Indian nation** as per their understanding
