## KARL MARX - THEORY OF ALIENATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIALISM (35:02)

### Key Questions and Concepts

- **What characterizes degradation of work in capitalist society according to Marx?** Simply elaborate his theory of alienation.
- **Critically examine the dialectics involved in each mode of production as propounded by Marx**
  - Talk about various historical epochs and how shift from one to the other involves dialectics meaning the three laws
  - How in each mode you have a struggle between the haves and the have nots
  - Unity and conflict of opposites
  - How each new mode the seeds of it are sewn in the womb of the previous mode
  - Change is gradual ultimately resulting in sudden transformation or the **law of transformation of quantitative changes into qualitative change**
  - **Law of negation of negation** meaning every stage is born out of destruction of the previous one

### Marx's Solution to Alienation

- **According to Marx, how are human beings alienated from their human potential and what does he suggest to change this?**
- Proposed solution: **establishment of a communist society** where people will no more be stuck in narrowly defined occupational roles
- You can hunt in the morning and stuff

### Historical Materialism vs Hegelian Dialectics

- **Critique analyze Marxian conception of historical materialism as critique of Hegelian dialectics**
- Marx emphasizes upon **materialism** while Hegel emphasizes upon **idealism**
- **Dialectics remains common to both**

### Marx vs Durkheim Comparison

| Aspect               | Marx (Alienation)                                                                | Durkheim (Anomie)                                                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition           | Disconnect between producer and product; product appears as stranger to producer | State of normlessness                                                                     |
| Solution Possibility | Cannot be overcome within framework of modern industrial capitalist society      | Anomie is transitional stage; will be thing of past once fully modern society established |
| Outlook              | Unhopeful about prospects in modern society                                      | Far more hopeful regarding prospects of human happiness in modern society                 |

### Similarities Between Marx and Durkheim

- Both are trying to analyze conditions of turmoil associated with modern industrial capitalist society
- Both see it as societal condition which affects the individual
- It's not so much about personal predilection or predisposition of a person

## MAX WEBER - BUREAUCRACY AND AUTHORITY (40:44)

### Weber's Iron Cage Theory

- **Do you agree with Weber's idea that bureaucracy has the potential to become an iron cage?**
- Process of **rationalization** and how bureaucrats become **specialists without spirit** in this iron cage of rationality
- This process of rationalization is essentially irrational in the end

### Bureaucracy as Iron Cage - Arguments

**Supporting Arguments:**

- Structurally rewards **compliance with rules** and not conformity in societal sense
- Penalizes any digression or not adhering to written rules
- Immense source of potential dissatisfaction

**Current Examples:**

- DM from Eastern UP penalized for providing water to village (went out of way to innovate)
- Railways compassionate appointment case - person suspended for bypassing rules

**Counter Arguments:**

- Ample number of examples of bureaucrats who have done pathbreaking work within framework
- Bureaucratic roles can be deep source of satisfaction and innate satisfaction
- Can do immense public good through bureaucratic work
- Can do innovative work within bureaucracy

### Weber's Ideal Types and Authority

- **Ideal types of Weber are mental constructs. They do not correspond to reality**
- **Which concepts did Weber use to analyze forms of legitimate domination?** The three forms of authority with examples and definition

### Features of Weberian Bureaucracy

- **Examine salient features of Weberian bureaucracy**
- Don't just list features - must **examine** means say what these features result in
- According to Weber: features result in high levels of efficiency, speed, predictability, control, lack of discretion
- Makes bureaucracy **technically superior** to any other form of organization
- Critics suggest these very features lead to alienating public etc.

### Power and Authority Relationship

- **Power and authority go together. Examine various types of authority**
- Authority is always accompanied by power or is a form of power
- **Not all power is authority**

## GEORGE HERBERT MEAD - THEORY OF SELF (49:40)

### Core Concept

- **According to Mead, the idea of self develops when individual becomes self conscious**
- At the **game stage** that one attains selfhood
- Use related terms and jargons: **symbolic interactionism, generalized other, significant other, I, me, play stage, game stage**

### Self and Society Are Twinborn

- **Both are not isolated from each other - literally like two sides of same coin**
- How self is formed is outcome of interactions with or in the society
- Various selves once formed then impact the society

**Two Aspects to Address:**

1. How self is constituted/formed by society
2. How society is formed due to interactions, exchange of symbols, conscious communication, unconscious communication

*Most answers only talked about one side - always keep in mind what question is asking*

## FAMILY, KINSHIP AND PATRIARCHY (52:14)

### Key Questions

- **Discuss various theoretical perspectives on family**
- **How do you understand relationship between patriarchy and social development?**

### Patriarchy and Social Development - Two Dimensions

**Most students explored only one dimension:**

1. How societal development level affects position of women or patriarchy
2. **Missing:** How patriarchy affects social development

*You must tailor your answer to demand of question - explore both aspects when there are two dimensions*

## RELIGION AND SOCIETY (54:08)

### Global Trends and Revivalism

- **Write note on global trends of secularization**
- **Comment on growth of religious revivalism in present day context**

### Theoretical Comparisons

#### Tyler vs Max Mueller on Religion

| Scholar     | Theory Focus   | Attribution                               |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Tyler       | Spirit worship | Different reasons, different orientations |
| Max Mueller | Nature worship | Different emergence of religion           |

**Both contributed immensely to sociological understanding of religion, albeit in different ways**

### Religion and Fundamentalism

- **Is religion playing important role in increasing fundamentalism? Give reasons for your answer**
- Though define fundamentalism first
- On face of it, does seem to be primarily religious affair
- But various non-religious factors contribute to growing fundamentalism: modernization, globalization
- **Steve Bruce:** certain religions (those with single book) are more prone to foment fundamentalist movements ⭐ (Note: This is a critical view that should be attributed to Steve Bruce, not stated as absolute fact)

**Fundamentalism viewed negatively because:**

- Tends to clash with other viewpoints or those who disagree with it
- When fundamentalism becomes problematic is when it conflicts with others

### Durkheim vs Weber on Religion

| Aspect              | Durkheim                                                    | Weber                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Focus               | Primitive form of religion (totemism of Aruna tribe)        | Major world religions                              |
| Approach            | No comparative study                                        | Comparative study of various religions             |
| Personal Connection | Dispassionate vantage point analysis (never visited Arunas) | Personally close (mother was practicing Calvinist) |
| Primary Concern     | How religion promotes social solidarity                     | How religious beliefs impact economic behavior     |
| Analysis Type       | Value relevant                                              | Value relevant                                     |

**Key Difference noted by student:**

- **Durkheim sees religion as promoting social stability**
- **Weber sees religion as major force of social change**

### Weber's Protestant Ethic - Fact and Value

**Facts:**

- Found empirical basis linking Protestantism and early capitalism
- Main center of economic activity had shifted to Protestant majority societies
- Early capitalists and highly skilled workers were overwhelmingly Protestant

**Values:**

- Values of Protestantism: predestination, calling, etc.
- Weber's choice of topic was **value relevant** (own social background affected choice)
- Once decided, tried to keep own value preferences aside

## SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY (67:17)

### Ethnicity in Contemporary World

- **Explain growing salience of ethnicity in contemporary world with illustrations**
- Must pepper answer with examples of ethnic conflicts or ethnic identity formations
- Examples: Jews/Palestinians conflict, Manipur, Sri Lanka, racial conflict in US, war on ethnicity

### Davis and Moore Theory

- **Davis and Moore made it clear that stratification is functional necessity and unconscious device**
- **Functional necessity:** Without it can't have effective role allocation and performance
- Every society attains effective role allocation and performance which is functional prerequisite
- **Unconscious device:** Societies don't do it consciously - kind of automatic sifting process

### Marx vs Weber on Stratification

| Aspect            | Marx                                                        | Weber                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Number of Classes | Two main classes                                            | Four major classes                   |
| Class Trajectory  | Petit bourgeoisie will sink into proletariat (polarization) | Expanding middle class               |
| Definition Basis  | Class defined economically                                  | Class plus status groups and parties |
| Revolution        | Inevitable                                                  | May happen, might not happen         |

**Similarities:**

- Both give adequate attention to class analysis or economic factors as major axis of differentiation
- Both contend small businesses will find it tough to compete with big businesses
- Workers are dissatisfied

## DEMOCRACY, POLITICAL PARTIES AND PRESSURE GROUPS (72:12)

### Political Parties Definition

- **Political parties are organized structures that promote candidates and contest elections with aim of capturing power**
- According to Weber: organized structure that promotes candidates and contests elections with aim of capturing power

### Pluralist Perspective on Political Parties

- **Plurality of political parties** in liberal democracy which seek to represent interests of diverse sections of society
- Multiple political parties promote interests of diverse sections of society
- **Political parties are necessarily representative in character** because if they don't represent people's wishes they will not secure vote
- Eventually all sections of society will find their concerns articulated by some political party

### Functions of Political Parties

1. **Political sensitization of masses** - make people aware of socio-political developments
2. **Political socialization** - make members aware of their role in political processes
3. **Interest articulation** - voice interests of different sections of society
4. **Interest aggregation and policy formulation** - take together numerous interests and formulate coherent policy (manifesto)
5. **Political recruitment** - identify political talent and recruit into political system
6. **Political training and socialization** - how to deliver public speech, solicit funds, balance competing interests
7. **Communication channel** - between people and government (both directions)
8. **Provide manpower for government** - ministers, legislators are members of political parties
9. **Check misuse of power** - opposition parties keep watchful eye on government

### Political Parties Over Time

- **Tend to represent wide cross-section of society** - continuously widen appeal and support base
- Example: BSP evolution from anti-upper caste ("Tilak, Tarazu, Talwar") to "Sarva Samaj" (society may all castes and communities prosper)
- Even Modi has said "Islam is religion of peace" seeking Muslim vote

### Pressure Groups Definition

- **Pressure groups are organizations that put pressure on political administrative system to protect and advance interests of its members**
- Examples: FICCI, CII, IMA (Indian Medical Association), trade unions (AITUC, INTUC), Maratha Sena, Bar Council of India, All India Muslim Personal Law Board

### Methods Used by Pressure Groups

- Petitions to government
- Violence, damaging public property
- Peaceful protests and demonstrations
- Educating public through TV debates, advertisements, opinion pieces
- **Funding** (legal and illegal mechanisms)
- **Providing expertise and information** at policy formulation stage

### Political Parties vs Pressure Groups

| Aspect         | Political Parties                                | Pressure Groups                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Power Seeking  | Contest elections, seek to capture power         | Do not contest elections, don't seek office |
| Representation | Claim to represent wide cross-section of society | Unabashedly focused on narrow social base   |
| Approach       | Try to balance competing demands                 | Explicitly work for specific section        |

### Relationship: Antagonistic Cooperation

**Antagonism:**

- Pressure groups put pressure on political parties in power
- Try to extract benefits for their members
- Political parties try to balance competing demands

**Cooperation:**

- Pressure groups help political parties in interest aggregation and policy formulation
- Opposition parties align with pressure groups against government
- Political parties seek support base through pressure groups (trade union arms, student wings)
- Political parties sensitized by pressure groups about what sections feel

**From Pluralist Perspective:**

- Both pressure groups and political parties are vital for health of liberal democracy
- Both organize people, sensitize on socio-political issues, articulate interests
- Pressure groups make democracy an everyday affair (not just at election time)

## SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND COLLECTIVE ACTION (131:17)

### Collective Action Types (Herbert Blumer)

1. **Crowd** - group swayed by same emotion (fear, panic, craze, angry outburst)
2. **Public** - group characterized by common cause, common issue  
3. **Mass** - recipients of common communication (context of mass media)
4. **Social Movement** - what we call Jan Andolan in Hindi

### Social Movement Definition

- **Social movement refers to collective effort which is somewhat sustained through formal or informal organization and is generally oriented towards bringing about some change in existing social order**

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Collective effort** (not individual action)
- **Sustained** (not momentary outburst like vandalizing bus after accident)
- **Organized** (formally like Indian National Congress in freedom struggle, or informally like #MeToo movement)
- **Change-oriented** (demand certain change OR prevent certain change)

### Examples of Social Movements

- Terry Dam protests, Chipko movement, Black Lives Matter, Me Too, RTI movement
- Movement against Citizenship Amendment Act, farm bills protests
- Anti-corruption movement (India Against Corruption)

### Significance of Social Movements

**Sociologically significant because they can bring about important changes:**

1. **Changes in laws and public policy** - RTI, Jan Lok Pal Bill, decriminalization of Section 377
2. **Changes in relationship between different sections of society** - Dalit movement transformed relationship between ex-untouchable castes and higher castes  
3. **Changes in social practices** - Sati, widow remarriage
4. **Changes in norms and values of society**

### Expression Through Protests and Agitations

**Academic Distinction:**

- **Protests** - against something (expression of disapproval, objection, opposition to something which as individual one is unable to prevent)
- **Agitation** - for something (social process involving activities by group to fulfill certain purpose - purpose-driven)

### Theoretical Frameworks

#### 1. Individuation Theory (Lebon)

- From book "The Crowd" (read by Hitler and Mussolini)
- **Crowd psychology develops** which is very different from individual psychology
- People do things as part of crowd which they wouldn't dare think of individually
- People develop **sense of invincibility** in crowd
- **Primal, destructive personality emerges**
- **Contagion effect** - certain behaviors and emotions spread very quickly in crowd
- **Leadership influence** - through speeches and actions affects crowd behavior

#### 2. Resource Mobilization Theory (Jenkins)

- **Merely sense of being deprived cannot build social movement**
- **Social movements require immense resources** - money, people, media attention, infrastructure, mass base
- **Movement leaders are like entrepreneurs** - cobble together all required resources
- **Social movement organizations are catalysts** that transform collective discontent into social movement

**Example:** India Against Corruption movement - people like Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal were entrepreneurs who channelized public discontent into movement by mobilizing funding, media attention, people
