## INTRODUCTION AND RECAP OF UNITY IN DIVERSITY (20:52)

- In the last lecture, we discussed **Unity in Diversity** in Indian society
- **Multiple diversities in India** include:
  - **Geographical diversity**: India is a huge landmass with four natural barriers
  - **Historical diversity**: Various populations have visited India during different points of time - invaders, traders, and others
  - **Large population size** contributing to social and cultural diversity

### Unity in Indian Society

- Indians are united on the basis of **religion** through:
  - Different religious communities participating in each other's festivities
  - Similar practices across communities like subordination of women, respect for joint family system
  - Common features across not just religious but also caste communities

### Salient Diversities in Indian Society

- **Racial diversity**: Five major races - Aryan, Dravidian, Mongoloids, Proto-Australoid, Negrito
- **Linguistic diversity**: According to People's Linguistic Survey of India, there are 900+ living languages, with several dead and dying languages
- **Religious diversity**: 79.8% Hindu, 14.2% Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, and others with various denominations, philosophies, deities, rituals, animism, naturism

### Unity Through Modern Aspects

- **Citizenship**
- **Common currency** 
- **Celebration of Independence Day and Republic Day**
- **National flag, national anthem, father of the nation**
- **Bollywood** also serves as a unifying force to some extent

## CASTE SYSTEM: INTRODUCTION AND BASIC CONCEPTS (30:24)

- **Caste** is regarded as one of the most unique features of Indian society, present only in India
- The word **'caste'** comes from the Portuguese word **'casta'** meaning lineage, which comes from the Latin word **'castus'** meaning pure
- Different scholars do not agree upon a single definition of caste, however some main features are as follows:

### Main Features of Caste System

#### 1. Ascribed Status

- **Ascribed status** means that you are born with it
- In caste society, every person's caste is determined by and at birth
- A member of caste society is not permitted to change his/her caste
- Every member is born in a particular caste, spends entire life as a member of that caste, and dies with the same caste identity
- Caste society strictly prohibits and provides no mechanism to acquire a new caste
- **The only way to become a member of a caste group is by being born in it**

#### 2. Occupational Specification and Rigidity

- Every caste is associated with a particular occupation
- Every member of that caste performs the same occupation
- **Sons acquire the skills required to perform one's caste occupation from their fathers**
- Examples: Sunar (goldsmith), Lohar (ironsmith), Baniya (trading), Badhai (carpentry)

#### 3. Endogamy

- **Endogamy** means to marry within a particular social group
- Every member of caste society must marry another person of the same caste
- **Endogamy is considered the heart and soul of the caste system** (according to AMBEDKAR)
- It is due to endogamy that caste has survived for thousands of years
- **Intercaste marriages** can be of two types:
  - **Anuloma** (Hypergamy): High caste man marries lower caste woman (was tolerated)  
  - **Pratiloma** (Hypogamy): Lower caste man marries higher caste woman (severely prohibited)

#### 4. Hierarchy

- In every part of the country, castes are arranged hierarchically
- No two castes are equal
- In every part of the country there is a highest caste, a lowest caste, and several castes between them
- Each caste is one above and one below another caste
- **It is a hierarchy of ritual purity** - Brahmins are above Kshatriyas in ritual terms, then Vaishyas, then Shudras

#### 5. Restrictions on Feeding and Social Intercourse

- There are clear and detailed guidelines laid down governing the exchange of food and water
- Rules for regulating social interactions between members of caste society
- In Hindi, we use terms **Roti Vyavhar** (rules governing exchange of food and water) and **Beti Vyavhar** (rules governing exchange of daughters)
- For violation of these rules and guidelines, several punishments were prescribed of varying degrees

#### 6. Civil and Religious Disabilities and Privileges of Different Sections

- **Religious disabilities**: Certain castes were prohibited from performing certain religious rituals (e.g., untouchable castes prohibited from entering temples)
- **Civil disabilities**: Limitations imposed on lower castes in non-religious matters (e.g., prohibited from using common village roads, acquiring education, drawing water from wells)
- **Religious privileges**: Only Brahmins had the privilege to make offerings to deity and chant mantras
- **Civil privileges**: Only higher castes were permitted to access and acquire education

## CASTE PANCHAYAT (88:31)

- **Caste panchayats** are different from village panchayats
- Village panchayats have constitutional status since 73rd Constitutional Amendment, but caste panchayats do not

### Composition and Functions

- Every caste in the village has its own **caste panchayat** and **caste council**
- It comprises of the **elderly members of that caste**
- The caste panchayat serves to **regulate the affairs of the caste members in the village**

### Functions of Caste Panchayat

#### 1. Dispute Settlement

- **Settles disputes between members of the same caste** such as:
  - Property disputes between brothers, cousins, neighbors
  - Marital disputes
  - Any conflicts within the caste community

#### 2. Enforcement of Caste Rules

- **Ensures that caste rules and regulations are adhered to**
- Particularly focuses on controlling youth who may violate caste norms through:
  - Cross-caste friendships
  - Intercaste affairs
  - Intercaste marriages

#### 3. Punishment Mechanisms

- Any violation of caste norms and rules is punished by measures like:
  - **Social boycott**
  - **Excommunication** from the caste
  - **Imposing fines**
  - **Hosting feasts** for all members of the community

#### 4. Occupational Monopoly Protection

- **Ensures that the monopoly of the caste over its caste occupation is maintained**
- Prevents members of other castes from encroaching upon their caste occupation
- Takes measures to stop any sort of support required for marketing, procurement when outsiders try to practice their occupation

#### 5. Political Mobilization

- During elections, caste panchayats mobilize members of that caste to vote collectively and assert their collective power
- Example from Western UP: "जाति से अलग नहीं जाते" (Don't separate from caste during elections)

## DEFINITIONS OF CASTE BY SCHOLARS (105:53)

### According to S.C. DUBE

- **"Jati is an endogamous unit with a more or less defined ritual status and some occupation traditionally linked to it"**

### According to SURJIT SINHA

- **"Caste is a hierarchy of endogamous groups organized in a characteristic hereditary division of labor"**

### According to ANDRE BETEILLE

- **"Caste is a small and named group of persons characterized by endogamy, hereditary membership and a specific style of life which sometimes includes pursuit by tradition of a particular occupation and usually associated with a distinct ritual status in a hierarchical system"**

### According to C.H. COOLEY

- **"When a class is somewhat strictly hereditary, we may call it a caste"**
- COOLEY's definition is very unsatisfactory and incomplete
- BETEILLE's definition is very comprehensive and detailed

## JAJMANI SYSTEM (122:26)

- **Jajmani system** is a system of **economic, social and ritual ties among different castes in a village**

### Key Components

#### Jajmans and Kamins

- **Jajmans**: The patron and recipient of a service (typically dominant landholding castes)
- **Kamins**: Service castes like barber, potter, washerman etc. who provide their specialized services to the jajmans and receive from them payment in kind (and less frequently in cash)

#### Operational Level

- MANDEL points out that **the jajmani relationship operated at the level of families**
- Not individual relationships but family-to-family hereditary connections spanning generations

### Nature of Jajmani System

- **Much more than only exchange of grains and money for services rendered**
- **Has an inherent ritual dimension**
- Based on sense of **duty and obligation** rather than purely economic exchange
- **Hereditary in nature** - if grandfather served your grandfather, then son will serve your son

### Ritual Obligations

- During ritual occasions such as **child birth, marriage etc., kamins render additional services to the jajmans**
- Kamins receive **gifts** (jewelry, clothes, utensils) apart from customary payments
- Strong moral, social and economic relationship between the two parties

## PERSPECTIVES ON JAJMANI SYSTEM (138:52)

### Positive View (WILLIAM WISER)

- **Jajmani system has been considered as the backbone of the rural economy and social order in traditional Indian society**
- **Involves interdependence, reciprocity and cooperation between jatis and families in the village**
- According to WILLIAM WISER, ensures **a sense of peace and security for the villagers**

### Critical View (Scholars like BEIDELMAN)

- **In the jajmani system, the land owning higher castes exploit the labor of the service castes (kamins) in name of ritual obligation**
- Higher castes extract labor without fully compensating the service providers
- System seen as exploitative by Dalit scholars and Marxist scholars

### Current Status

- **Jajmani system has to a very good extent been replaced by market-based exchange**
- The market mechanism has penetrated not just urban areas but significantly also in rural areas
- Jajmani may have survived in pockets and occasionally during major festivals, but for the most part it has been replaced by market-based exchange

| Aspect           | Jajmani System                     | Market-Based Exchange          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Nature**       | Hereditary, ritual obligation      | Momentary transaction          |
| **Payment**      | In kind (grains) + occasional cash | Cash payment                   |
| **Relationship** | Long-term family relationships     | Temporary service relationship |
| **Obligation**   | Moral and social duty              | Pure economic exchange         |
| **Scope**        | Limited to caste-based services    | Open market competition        |

## CASTE AND VARNA RELATIONSHIP (153:19)

### Basic Distinction

- **Four Varnas**: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra  
- **Thousands of castes** which can be fitted into these four varnas
- Several castes do not fit into this four-fold varna scheme and lie **outside the varna system**
- These are known as **Avarna** (without varna) - the **untouchable castes**
- They are considered as **Ati Shudra** (below Shudras) and **Avarna**

### Operational Reality

- **Caste is the lived social reality** and operational unit on the ground
- **Varna is more like a theoretical pan-India macro framework**
- When you enter a village, you encounter **castes** - people say "I am Baniya, I am Jat, I am Yadav" rather than "I am Vaishya, I am Kshatriya"
- Society operates in terms of **caste** rather than varna

### Utility of Varna System

- **Varna provides a pan-India framework** in which thousands of castes can be fitted
- According to M.A. SRINIVAS: **"Varna model has enabled ordinary people to assess the place of a caste in its framework throughout India"**
- Helps people from different parts of country to locate social position of members from distant parts
- Example: If someone from Haryana goes to Tamil Nadu and reveals they belong to Brahmin varna, the Tamil person can understand their social position

## SUB-CASTES AND GOTRA (163:49)

### Sub-castes

- According to GHURYE: **"Sub-castes are the real castes"**
- The operative units are actually **sub-castes** where all features of caste actually apply
- Example: **Teli caste** is further divided into:
  - **Ek Bail Teli** (one bull teli) 
  - **Do Bail Teli** (two bull teli)
  - **Shanivar Teli** (Saturday teli - originally Jews who became oil pressers)

### Gotra System

- **Gotra** is an **exogamous clan** whose members are considered to have descended from a common ancestor
- Unlike caste (endogamous unit), **gotra is an exogamous unit**
- You have to marry within your own caste but marry a person of different gotra than yours
- **Gotra are exogamous clans** - you cannot marry within the same gotra

### Examples in Baniya Community

- **17 and half gotras** among Baniyas
- Some gotras: **Garg, Bansal, Kansal, Mittal, Jindal, Singal, Tingal, Mangal, Goyal**
- Example: If someone belongs to Aggarwal caste and Garg gotra, their spouse must belong to Baniya caste but non-Garg gotra

### Surnames

- **Surnames may reflect caste, sub-caste, gotra, or titles**
- There is far greater flexibility with respect to surnames compared to caste and gotra
- People can change surnames (e.g., from occupational names to generic caste names like Aggarwal)
- Some use gotra names as surnames (Kashyap, Bharadwaj - Brahmin gotras)
- Some use titles like Chaudhary, Lumberdar, Kumar
