## KERALA MODEL APPLICABILITY (10:33)

- Kerala model is not applicable to other states due to different demographics
- Kerala has coastal line, foreign trade, Portuguese influences which other states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya lack

- Literally "a nation on the move" - people are born and then shift

### Migration Factors

- **Push Factors**: Drought, floods, war, civil strife, lack of income, low income levels
- **Pull Factors**: Job opportunities, educational facilities, better infrastructure

### Migration Patterns in India

- **Biggest reason for migration**: Marriage (49% of people migrate for marriage)
- Overwhelming majority of marriage migrants are women due to:
  - Social rules of village exogamy
  - Patrilocal residence patterns

### Migration by Demographics

- **Followed by**: Children  
- **Least**: Elderly

### Interstate Migration Statistics

- **Total interstate migrants**: 6 crore (AMITABH KUNDU's estimates)

## REVERSE MIGRATION (26:39)

- **Reverse Migration**: Social phenomenon where migrants leave the host region or host city after having spent a certain time over there and return to their place of origin

### Characteristics

- Not a new phenomenon, existed before pandemic
- Started happening on very large scale during pandemic
- Often temporary in character - people want to go back to host city
- In Indian context: largely from urban areas to rural areas

### Causes of Reverse Migration

1. **Economic hardship** caused by pandemic (people lost jobs)
2. **Seasonal nature** of agriculture and employment in host region
3. **Social and cultural factors** (marriages, illness, death in family)
4. **Strong emotional ties** to home base
5. **Political factors** (policy changes in host country)
6. **Civil strife** in host regions

### Scholars' Analysis

#### DEEPANKAR GUPTA's Analysis

- Migrants were not returning for financial reasons during pandemic
- Financial situation back home is worse
- They were returning because they were fearing imminent death
- Wanted to die near their loved ones and kin
- Funeral rites have to be performed across communities

#### GOPAL GURU's Analysis

- Pandemic produced two types of responses:
  - **Rational anxiety**
  - **Irrational anxiety** (which doesn't make sense)
- Workers exhibited rational anxiety because they had been abandoned in the city
- Employers, middle-class households, landlords, and the state washed their hands of responsibility

### Consequences of Reverse Migration

1. **Economic concerns**: Shortage of workforce in factories
2. **Social structure changes**: 
   - Family dynamics changed from female-headed units back to male-headed units
   - Increase in domestic violence (termed "shadow pandemic" by UN)
3. **Highlighted need** for wide social security net and national health scheme

### Scholarly Perspectives on Pandemic Impact

#### SUJATA PATEL

- Urban poor and migrants living in slums suffered various hardships even in pre-pandemic times
- Lack of basic amenities (water, sanitation facilities, proper housing)
- Lockdown thoughtlessly applied by state worsened their condition

#### ASHISH NANDY

- Pandemic highlighted the need for wide social security net and national health scheme

#### SUBHASH PALSHIKAR

- Clear social distance exists between middle class and working class in urban areas
- Middle class couldn't care less about the plight of working class
- Reverse migration exhibited the wide chasm between the two classes

## CASTE CENSUS DEBATE (52:17)

### Historical Context

- **Last caste census in India**: 1931
- Practice started by British in their census operations
- 1941: Did not collect caste information due to World War
- **After Independence**: Consciously stopped collecting caste data
- We do collect data on **Scheduled Castes** population
- **Current demand**: To enumerate OBC castes

### Recent Developments

- **2018**: Home Minister AMIT SHAH declared government intended to conduct caste census
- **Bihar**: Recently conducted caste census
- **Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011**: Listed more than 45 lakh caste, sub-caste and clan names

### Arguments in Favor of Caste Census

#### Political and Academic Support

- Demand made regularly since MANDAL COMMISSION times (1979-80)
- **Supreme Court**: Underlined need for empirical data regarding socio-economic position of different castes and communities
- **National Commission for Backward Classes**: Earlier recommended conducting caste census
- Large number of political parties in favor

#### SATISH DESHPANDE's Argument

- World's largest affirmative action program being conducted without any scientific or empirical basis
- Both main political parties (Congress and BJP) dominated by upper castes
- Both uncomfortable with intermediate castes or OBCs
- Expected that caste census will highlight and strengthen the case for OBCs

#### YOGENDRA YADAV's Arguments

- Extremely important that we know the current social reality of different castes
- Simply adding a caste column in census will generate wealth of data:
  - Which caste has latrines in homes
  - Mobile ownership by caste
  - Literacy rates by caste
- **Ultimate caste privilege is to remain casteless**
- Upper caste Hindus (about 20% of population) have cornered about 80% of all privileges

### Arguments Against Caste Census

#### Historical Criticisms

##### GOVIND GURUJI (Colonial Era)

- Critical of colonial era caste censuses
- Census data became important basis for anti-Brahman movement in Tamil Nadu
- Led to caste-based hatred against certain communities

##### VEENA DAS

- Colonial era caste censuses led to increasing demands for political representation
- Instead of issue-based politics, people began engaging in identity-based politics
- Can result in caste-based protests and agitations
- Will disturb social harmony

#### Practical Problems

1. **Spelling and pronunciation variations**: Same caste may have different spellings/pronunciations
2. **Similar names for different castes**: Example of MEENA and MEENA (different castes written same way in English)
3. **Classification confusion**: Led to wrong communities getting benefits
4. **2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census**: Noted more than 45 lakh different caste names

#### Divisive Concerns

- **British policy of divide and rule**: Caste census was part of this policy
- May lead to political disturbance and create divisions
- Will keep caste alive in people's consciousness
- May lead to population increase as castes try to boost numbers

### Current Status and Analysis

- Both major parties (Congress and BJP) dominated by upper castes and uncomfortable with caste census
- **YOGENDRA YADAV**: Caste census being opposed due to deep-seated anxiety of upper castes that it will expose/unmask caste privilege they enjoy

| Aspect           | Pro-Caste Census                        | Anti-Caste Census                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Data Need        | Scientific basis for affirmative action | May create divisions              |
| Social Impact    | Expose privilege, ensure representation | Keep caste alive, disturb harmony |
| Political Impact | Strengthen democracy                    | Identity-based politics           |
| Practical Issues | Can be resolved with better methods     | Too many complications            |

## STUDY ADVICE AND MENTAL HEALTH (108:22)

### Academic Preparation Timeline

- **After completing sociology course**: Write Paper 2 full length in 1 week
- **After 10 days**: Write Paper 1 and 2 full length on same day  
- **Then**: Keep sociology aside and focus exclusively on prelims
- **If well-placed in prelims**: Consider quick revision 2-3 months before exam
- **Priority**: Prelims preparation should not be compromised

### Managing Exam Stress

#### Reality Check

- **Bad news first**: It's only going to get tougher with time
- Enthusiasm and confidence levels peak at start, then decline
- **Failure is expected**: Even successful candidates fail several times
- Success chances are statistically very low
- **Mental challenge > Academic challenge**: This exam is more of mental challenge

#### Practical Strategies

##### 1. Structured Planning

- **Have written study schedule**: Commitment to yourself on paper
- **Leave some margin**: Don't plan for all 7 days, plan for 5-6 days
- **Keep 6th and 7th days**: For spillover or revision
- **Provision for illness**: Everyone falls sick, plan for 10-15 days/year
- **Include slots for**: Revisions, answer writing, margin of error

##### 2. Mental Health Management

- **Work on mental health**: Very important
- **Mental health issues are common**: Not "being crazy", just levels of struggle
- **Common issues among aspirants**: Inferiority complex, self-doubt (even among successful candidates)
- **Daily non-academic time**: Have some sort of non-academic time in daily schedule
- **Do something you enjoy**: Pranayama, yoga, listening to music, movies, chatting with friends
- **Don't punish yourself**: Studies should not be punishment or burden
- **Enjoy your studies**: Can be more enjoyable in earlier sessions
- **Don't take yourself too seriously**: Develop thick skin against society's comments

##### 3. Physical Health

- **Very important**: Healthy mind houses in healthy body
- **Quit smoking and drinking**: These take away all your strength  
- **Eat healthy**: Spend money on quality food if you can afford
- **Eat lots of fresh fruits**: Very beneficial
- **Get physical activity**: Exercise, gym, running, walking
- **Get fresh air**: Generates happy hormones, develops positive attitude

##### 4. Social Support System

- **Identify supportive people**: Usually parents or close friends
- **Have daily chats**: Need not be meaningful, can be casual
- **Have someone to vent with**: Very important for mental health
- **Laugh a lot**: This becomes less with time, try to maintain it

##### 5. Sustainable Study Hours

- **Target 7-8 hours daily**: Good enough for regular study
- **Don't target unrealistic hours**: Not 11-12-15 hours daily
- **Quality over quantity**: 8 hours of quality input is sufficient
- **Break study into chunks**: 1.5-2 hours, then take 1-hour break
- **Respect attention span**: Everyone has different attention spans
- **Take healthy breaks**: Include daily ablutions, meals, naps if needed

##### 6. Philosophical Approach

- **Be sincere and devoted**: Do your task with utmost seriousness
- **Don't get obsessed with end result**: Try to enjoy the journey
- **Bhagavad Gita philosophy**: You own your effort, not your result
- **End satisfaction**: Should feel "I couldn't have done more"
- **Focus on effort**: What you can control vs what you cannot

### Final Guidelines

- **Answer writing**: Not advisable till March if writing 2024 exam
- **Stop answer writing**: By mid-January, focus exclusively on prelims
- **Maintain regular schedule**: Consistency is key
- **Remember**: Even achieving something, stay grounded
