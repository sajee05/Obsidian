# Perspectives to Study Indian Society

## Introduction and Indological Approach (06:38)

- **Indological Approach Definition**: Understanding Indian scriptures and then understanding of the Indian society
- **Core Principle**: Why must we study Indian society through a study of its scriptures? Because Indian scriptures provide better understanding of the social reality of India
- **Key Question**: Why do Indian scriptures offer a better insight than the Western templates?

### Prominent Indologists

**Contemporary Indologists:**

- KAPIL KAPOOR
- RAJIV MALHOTRA

**Historical Indologists:**

- MAX MÜLLER
- WILLIAM JONES  
- LOUIS DUMONT
- SHELDON POLLOCK
- WENDY DONIGER

### Indian Sociologists Who Applied Indological Approach

- RADHA KAMAL MUKHERJEE
- MCKIM MARRIOTT
- DAVID POCOCK

### Criticisms of Indological Approach

- **Textual Focus**: It only relied upon scriptures
- **Distance from Reality**: It may be far removed from the actual situation
- **Limited Empirical Base**: Lacks connection to ground realities

## Structural-Functional Approach (12:21)

- **Core Concept**: Society comprises of interlinked parts and it is interdependent on each other
- **Social Institutions**: The various parts of the society are social institutions that are interdependent on each other
- **Functions**: These parts contribute towards the maintenance and well-being of the society as a whole, ensuring continuity and stability in society

### Pioneer and Influences

- **Main Pioneer**: M.N. SRINIVAS 
- **Inspirations**: SRINIVAS was inspired in his methodology by A.R. RADCLIFFE-BROWN and EVANS-PRITCHARD

### Major Village Studies

| Scholar        | Village Studied          | Location        |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| M.N. SRINIVAS  | Rampura Village and Korg | Various regions |
| ANDRE BETEILLE | Sripuram Village         | Tamil Nadu      |
| S.C. DUBE      | Shamirpet Village        | -               |
| MCKIM MARRIOTT | Kishan Garh              | -               |

### Merits of Structural-Functional Approach

- **Empirical View**: It gives us an empirical view of the Indian social reality
- **Corrective to Indological Approach**: It offered a corrective to the Indological approach in being contextual rather than textual

### Criticisms of Structural-Functional Approach

- **Ignores Diversity**: Ignores diversity in Indian villages
- **Urban Neglect**: Ignores urban areas with its focus on village studies  
- **Harmony Emphasis**: More emphasis on cooperation and harmony and consequent neglect of exploitation and conflict
- **Conservative Nature**: It is conservative and status quoist
- **Justifies Inequality**: It justifies social inequity

## Marxist Approach - A.R. DESAI's Perspective (20:18)

### Background of Marxist Theory

- **Founders**: KARL MARX and FRIEDRICH ENGELS
- **Context**: They lived in Europe in England where they saw the very pathetic conditions in which the industrial working class was living
- **Core Emphasis**: Marxism emphasizes on economic factors as the key variables which affect and determine the course of society and the nature of social life

### Basic Marxist Principles

- **Economic Base**: Everything depends on the economy. As the economy changes so does the family, religion, political system, education system, everything
- **Class Division**: In every era, in every stage of history, society is characterized by and divided into two main antagonistic and opposing classes - the haves and the have nots
- **Means of Production**: Haves are those who have ownership of the means of production. Have nots are those who do not own the wealth of the society

### Class Structure Examples

**Feudal Society:**

- **Haves**: Feudal lords who own the land (numerical minority, ruling class)
- **Have Nots**: Serfs who till the land but do not own land (numerical majority)

**Industrial Capitalist Society:**

- **Haves**: Factory owners/Capitalists (minuscule minority but ruling class)  
- **Have Nots**: Factory workers (oppressed majority)

### Additional Class Categories

- **Bourgeoisie**: Fancier term for the capitalist class
- **Proletariat**: Term for the working class
- **Petty Bourgeoisie**: Small businesses, small traders, businessmen, merchants who employ small amount of capital and seek small amount of profit

### Marxist View of Social Change

- **Class Conflict**: Social life is characterized by continuous conflict, oppression and exploitation of the have nots by the haves
- **Revolutionary Change**: Society will transform from capitalist type to communist society after a bloody revolution
- **Working Class Revolution**: The working class will rise up together when they realize the reality of their situation
- **Communist Society**: A classless egalitarian society where all members equally enjoy the collective resources with no notion of private property

### A.R. DESAI's Application to India

#### Methodology

- **DESAI uses the method of historical materialism to understand the nature of Indian society and economy**
- **DESAI focuses on the economic factors of social life and analyzes them using the dialectical approach**

#### Pre-Colonial Indian Society Analysis

- **DESAI argues that pre-colonial Indian society was organized in terms of numerous self-sufficient and isolated village communities**
- **Land was not owned privately but was held in common by the village community**  
- **Feudal agrarian relations and hereditary caste based exchange characterized the stagnant and unchanging village economy in pre-colonial India**

#### Impact of Colonial Rule

- **Colonial rule brought about significant changes in Indian society and economy**
- **Particularly it created conducive conditions for the emergence and growth of nationalism in India**
- **Nationalism could not have emerged in India in the economic and cultural climate of pre-British times**

### Factors Contributing to Nationalism

**Major Colonial Changes:**

- **Destruction of centuries old caste based exchange**
- **Establishment of centralized administration**  
- **Introduction of modern education**
- **New technologies like the railways, the printing press**
- **Ruin of Indian agriculture and handicrafts**
- **Decline of village artisans**
- **Introduction of modern factory system and industrial machinery**

**Results:**

- **The changes resulted in the growth of new social classes such as:**
  - **Rural Areas**: Absentee landlords, agricultural laborers, and money lenders
  - **Urban Areas**: Capitalists, industrial working class, managers, professionals like doctors, lawyers

### Evolution of Indian Nationalism

#### Phase 1: Initial Narrow Base

- **Initially Indian nationalism had a very narrow social base**
- **Indian intelligentsia who were a product of the modern education system established by the British and who had internalized Western democratic and nationalist ideas were the first Indians to develop national consciousness**
- **People like RAJA RAMMOHUN ROY and other enlightened Indians were the pioneers of Indian nationalism**
- **They undertook socio-religious reforms, championed freedom of press and propagated principles of democracy, rationalism etc.**

#### Phase 2: 1885 to 1905 - Liberal Phase

- **The liberals headed the Congress during this time**
- **Indian nationalism expanded to the educated middle class whose numbers had significantly increased with expansion of education**
- **Modern industry also grew during this time and the emerging class of Indian industrialists also got attracted towards the Congress**
- **The Congress in this phase articulated the demands of the educated Indians and the Indian bourgeoisie such as Indianization of the services, holding the exam in India (civil service exam previously held in Britain), stopping the economic drain etc.**

#### Phase 3: 1905 to 1918 - Extremist Phase

- **The extremists captured leadership of the Congress**
- **Their political propaganda instilled self-respect and confidence amongst the people**
- **The social base of the nationalist movement further widened and the movement became more militant (lower middle classes also joined)**
- **Upper class Muslims also developed political consciousness and established the Muslim League, which eventually became increasingly communal**

#### Phase 4: 1918 to 1930 - Mass Movement Phase

- **During this time the national movement acquired a mass base - it became mass based**
- **Indian capitalists had become strong by this time and more aggressively supported the Indian national movement**
- **They supported the Congress financially through campaign funding and started exerting a great influence on the programs, policies, strategies and tactics of the Congress-led national movement**

#### Phase 5: 1934 to 1939 - Diversification Phase

**New developments that took place:**

- **A section of the Congress got disillusioned with GANDHI's leadership and formed the Congress Socialist Party**
- **The Muslim League grew stronger**
- **The Communist Party gained influence**
- **There was also a demand for reorganizing the provinces along linguistic lines**
- **Increasing militant agitation amongst the Indian peasantry**

### Class Analysis of National Movement

- **Eventually which class was able to capture the national movement? The capitalist class**
- **The Indian capitalists were able to capture the national movement through their class party which was the Indian National Congress**
- **Indian National Congress is a class party of the Indian bourgeoisie**
- **Why were the Indian capitalists supporting the freedom struggle? Because the policies of the colonial state promoted the interest of British capital in Indian economy at the expense of Indian capital**
- **Indian industry could not prosper within the colonial political framework. That is why they supported the anti-colonial nationalist movement**

## Post-Independence Analysis by DESAI (88:01)

### Nature of Indian Development Path

- **DESAI argues that the Indian state has ensured the capitalist development of Indian economy and society since independence**
- **The legal and administrative frameworks have evolved to promote capitalist development**
- **The public sector, mixed economy and social welfare programs are strategies adopted by the ruling class to promote by deception the class interest of the capitalists**

### State's Role in Capitalist Development

#### Rural Transformation

- **The Indian state has transformed the agrarian structure from pre-capitalist to capitalist through various land legislations and development programs**
- **The state has created classes of agricultural capitalists, rich farmers and peasant proprietors in the rural areas**

#### Urban Development

- **Created the industrial bourgeoisie in the urban areas, who are directly dependent on the state**

### Constitutional Framework Analysis

- **DESAI classifies democratic rights into three types:**

| Type                          | Examples                                         | Status                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Rights of the Bourgeoisie** | Right to property, freedom of trade and commerce | **Protected**         |
| **Civil Rights**              | Freedom of press, freedom of speech              | **Regularly crushed** |
| **Rights of the Proletariat** | Right to strike                                  | **Regularly crushed** |

- **The second and third types of rights are regularly crushed by the capitalist state in order to ensure unhindered and intensified capital accumulation**

### Critique of Welfare State

- **Welfare state is a myth propagated by the ruling classes**
- **The so-called welfare measures of the Indian capital state have failed to remove mass poverty, hunger and landlessness**
- **They have failed to tackle glaring inequalities and discrimination**
- **Instead, the Indian capital state has ruthlessly crushed the voices, democratic rights and aspirations of the Indian people**

## Subaltern Approach (131:54)

### Background and Origins

- **Key Scholar**: RANAJIT GUHA
- **Period**: Between 1982 and 2005, 12 volumes of historical scholarship were published
- **GUHA's Important Work**: "Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency in Colonial India"
- **Inspiration**: GUHA was inspired by MARXIST writings but began looking at MARX critically
- **Theoretical Source**: The notion of the subaltern was developed by ANTONIO GRAMSCI (Italian philosopher and Marxist)

### Critique of Marx's View of Peasantry

- **MARX's Position**: MARX compared peasants to a sack of potatoes - considering the peasantry to be inconsequential in history
- **MARX believed**: The peasantry was passive and incapable of revolution. The peasantry lacks any revolutionary potential
- **MARX's Focus**: Only the industrial working class (proletariat) had revolutionary potential

### GUHA's Observation

- **Reality Check**: In the real world there appear to be many peasant uprisings and revolts in many parts of the globe
- **Third World Context**: In many third world countries, numerous peasant uprisings, revolts and rebellions were taking place
- **Problem**: These countries were not industrialized, so they did not have a well-developed industrial working class
- **Conclusion**: GUHA found the Marxist framework inadequate to explain the peasant insurgencies in the third world countries

### Definition of Subaltern

- **The subaltern refers to a large number of oppressed and marginalized social groups who are dominated and exploited in the society and marginalized in the mainstream discourse**

**Subaltern Groups Include:**

- Peasants
- Tribals  
- Dalits
- Slaves
- Religious minorities
- Racial minorities
- Other social groups who suffer not only economic oppression but also cultural subordination

### Two Levels of Colonial Politics

#### Elite Politics

- **Nature**: Politics of the educated, privileged sections of Indian society
- **Methods**: 
  - Petitioning the government
  - Writing in newspapers to generate favorable public opinion
  - Conducting marches and meetings
  - Passing resolutions
- **Focus**: Mainstream history writing has focused primarily on this elite politics

#### Subaltern Politics

- **Nature**: Politics of the marginalized sections, often ignored or sidelined by mainstream history writing
- **Mainstream View**: According to mainstream historians, the subalterns are pre-political and require the guidance of the elites
- **Subaltern School Argument**: Subalterns had their own political methods and expressions different from that of the elites

### Characteristics of Subaltern Politics

#### Methods of Expression

- **Not in written form** like Congress resolutions and press statements
- **Expressed through violence** - random acts of violence, vandalism, destruction of public property
- **Typically recorded as law and order issues** rather than political expression

#### Two-Level Operation

1. **Opposed colonial rule** because it was oppressive and destructive
2. **Opposed local oppressors** - the landlords, the money lenders

#### Contrast with Elite Politics

- **Elite politics** also opposed colonial rule but tried to taper over the differences within Indian society
- **Elite politics** did not want subaltern politics against the local oppressors to find full expression

### Forms of Subaltern Political Expression

#### Community-Based Organization

- **Subaltern politics was often organized along the lines of community identity**
- **Examples**: Caste identity, tribal identity

#### Religious Expression

- **Subaltern politics also often found expression in a religious idiom**

**Examples:**

- **DAVID HARDIMAN's Study**: Gujarati tribals in 1922 mobilized against Parsi liquor dealers, claiming that the local goddess had instructed the tribals to stop consuming alcohol and dealing with the Parsis

#### Reinterpretation of National Leaders

- **SHAHID AMIN's Study**: "Gandhi as Mahatma"
- **Context**: In early 1920, during Gandhian protests in Chauri Chaura
- **Development**: A rumor started circulating that Gandhi had magical powers
- **Result**: The subalterns reinterpreted Gandhi's message and became violent (Gandhi said "do or die," they interpreted it as "beat them up")

### Criticisms of Subaltern Approach

#### From Nationalists

- **Criticism**: For downplaying the heroism of the national leadership

#### From Marxists

- **Criticism**: For downplaying the importance of economic factors

#### From Feminist Scholars (GAYATRI SPIVAK)

- **Article**: "Can the Subaltern Speak?"
- **Criticism**: The subaltern approach tends to simplistically celebrate popular resistances
- **Problem**: Most of the struggles and acts of violence barely had any impact
- **Issue**: Unnecessary glorification of people's resistances

#### Academic Criticisms

- **Elite Background**: The leading members of the subaltern school were themselves from elite backgrounds, not subaltern
- **Right to Speak**: They appropriate to themselves the right to speak for the oppressed
- **Male Bias**: Clear male bias in subaltern history writing - they ignore the life experiences of subaltern women and celebrated the macho exploits of male peasants and tribals

#### Methodological Issues

- **Overly Optimistic**: Subaltern theorists are very optimistic with a lot of hope and firm belief in people's power
- **Assumption Problem**: They assumed that all popular resistances have an emancipatory potential
- **Reality Check**: Most of these did not make any material difference to the colonial power structure
