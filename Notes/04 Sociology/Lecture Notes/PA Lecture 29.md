# Position of Women in Society

## Introduction and Context (24:30)

- The lecture follows a previous discussion on diversity in marriage and family, with a detailed discussion on same-sex unions.
- This session focuses on the position of women in society.

## Personal Experiences of Gender Discrimination (38:55)

- Students shared personal experiences about gender discrimination in their families and society:
  
  - Women's mobility is often restricted compared to men
  - In some families, girl children are sent to Hindi medium schools while boys are sent to English medium schools
  - Different expectations regarding pursuing passions in life (men are more encouraged)
  - Women's names sometimes reflect unwantedness (example: "Nakosi" meaning unwanted in Maharashtra)
  - Girls face restrictions in medical specialties like surgery
  - Sexual harassment and molestation are common experiences
  - Women are often considered property (historically and culturally)

- Some male students also shared experiences of perceived discrimination:
  
  - Sisters receiving greater pocket money
  - Fathers being more lenient with daughters
  - Fathers having "soft spots" for daughters

## Global Status of Women (71:20)

- Women constitute 50% of the world's population

- They work for 2/3 of the world's work hours

- They earn 1/10th (10%) of the world's income

- They own 1/100th (1%) of the world's property

- This statement originated from a United Nations report in 1980

- It was reiterated in a World Bank document in 2012

- Additional global statistics:
  
  - According to UN Women, less than 20% of the world's landholders are women
  - Women make up more than 2/3 of the world's illiterate population
  - World Bank reports only six countries in the world give women equal legal work rights as men
  - UN has pointed out that globally women spend three times as many hours as men on unpaid domestic work

## Patriarchy and Sexual Division of Labor (76:35)

- **Patriarchy**: Literally means "rule of the father" (patri + archy)
  
  - Originally referred to male dominance/father's authority in the home/family
  - Today has much wider connotation - male dominance in society in general

- According to SYLVIA WALBY: "Patriarchy is a system of social structures and practices where men dominate, oppress and exploit women"

- Patriarchy is a universal phenomenon

- **Sexual Division of Labor**: In society certain tasks are allocated to women while certain other tasks are assigned to men
  
  - Tasks traditionally assigned by gender:
    - Truck drivers, plumbers, civil engineers → Men
    - Nurses, primary school teachers, household chores → Women

### Theories on Sexual Division of Labor (87:30)

- **MURDOCH's Theory**:
  
  - Studied 224 societies across the globe
  - Concluded sexual division of labor is universal in all societies
  - Reasons based on human biology/anatomy:
    1. Male body is stronger than female body, so tasks requiring greater muscular power are assigned to men
    2. Female anatomy is associated with childbirth and nursing, restricting women's mobility
    3. Tasks requiring travel to long distances are assigned to men
    4. Tasks that can be done near home are assigned to women

- **ANN OAKLEY's Critique**:
  
  - Criticizes Murdoch's study
  - Argues sexual division of labor is not universal
  - Provides examples from various societies:
    - In 38 societies, cooking is done by both sexes
    - In 14 societies, lumbering is done by both sexes
  - Points out that in many countries, women are important part of armed forces (China, Russia, Israel)
  - Notes many women perform physically strenuous work (construction sites, carrying water in rural India)
  - Questions why women's work should be accorded lower prestige regardless of physical requirements

## Women and Development (96:56)

- The position of women in society is intimately linked to the level of societal development:
  
  - In more developed societies (Northern Europe, North America), women's position is relatively better than in developing societies like India
  - The status of women also affects the developmental process

- **Development is Gendered**:
  
  - Men and women are not equally beneficiaries of development
  - Men benefit more from developmental processes than women
  - The process of development affects men and women differently

### Gender Gaps in Labor and Economy (101:53)

- According to the International Labor Organization:
  
  - Global gender gap in labor force participation rate is about 23%
  - In South Asia, the gender gap is as high as 50%
  - In Europe and North America, the gender gap is about 12%

- **Motherhood Penalty**:
  
  - Women have fewer opportunities for managerial positions
  - A woman's chances of rising to managerial levels are substantially reduced if she is a mother

- **VERONICA BEECHEY's Analysis** (Marxist Feminist Scholar):
  
  - Women are an important component of the "reserve army of labor"
  - Women workers are more expendable compared to male workers because:
    - Men are considered primary breadwinners
    - Women's income is considered supplementary
    - Women's primary social role/identity is as mother/housewife
    - Women require breaks in careers during pregnancy/childbirth

- **Glass Ceiling**:
  
  - An invisible barrier preventing women from rising to top levels
  - Contributing factors include:
    - Male-dominated corporate leadership ("boys club")
    - Male workers' difficulty accepting female authority
    - Traditional notions of masculinity and femininity
    - Workplace structures favoring traditional male career patterns

- **Glass Cliff** (concept by MICHELLE RYAN):
  
  - When organizations face uncertainty or high chance of failure, women are promoted to leadership positions
  - When failure occurs, blame is placed on female leadership
  - Reinforces self-fulfilling prophecy that "women don't make good leaders"

### Sexual Harassment in Workplace (121:48)

- **ELIZABETH STANKO defines sexual harassment** as "unwanted sexual attention" (verbal, visual, or physical)

- Sexual harassment is a mechanism for men to mark out the workplace as their territory

- UK government survey found:
  
  - 72% of UK population had experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime
  - Only 33% of those who faced harassment reported it
  - Reasons for not reporting include social stigma and victim-blaming

- **LISA ADKINS** highlights **sexualization of women's work**:
  
  - In many industries, young and attractive women are deliberately employed
  - Women are encouraged to use their sexuality to cater to male clients
  - Examples include air hostesses, receptionists, promotional models

## Women and Religion (138:33)

- All major religions across the globe are broadly patriarchal

- **KAREN ARMSTRONG** points out:
  
  - In most cultures, God is male
  - Most church/religious positions are held by men
  - Menstruation taboo is prevalent in many religions
  - Founders and prophets of most religions are men
  - Religious scriptures have been mostly authored and interpreted by men

- Religion affects social relations, rights, and privileges:
  
  - Differential duties and rights of husband and wife
  - Rights over children
  - Property inheritance
  - Divorce and maintenance laws
  - Most of these norms favor men

- **SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR** in her book "THE SECOND SEX" writes:
  
  - "Religion is the opium of women"
  - Religion prevents women from questioning the status quo
  - It makes women accept their lower status in society
  - Religion teaches women to be submissive and subservient to men

## Abortion Rights Discussion (151:22)

- **ROE VS. WADE case** (1970s):
  
  - US Supreme Court delivered landmark judgment
  - American women gained the right to abortion
  - Recently this judgment has been overturned

- Two opposing perspectives:
  
  - **Pro-choice**: Women must have the right to choose whether they want to give birth
    
    - Asserts women's rights over their own bodies (bodily autonomy)
    - Democratic Party generally supports this position
  
  - **Pro-life**: The fetus/unborn child has a right to life once conceived
    
    - No one including the mother has the right to take away that right
    - Republican Party generally supports this position (conservative/right-wing)

- **JOSHUA ANGRIST's Analysis**:
  
  - Right to abortion has led to:
    - Increase in women's education
    - Improved labor force participation
    - Increase in women's earnings
    - Women gaining confidence to plan their future
    - These benefits are amplified for black women

- Right to abortion is key for women's reproductive autonomy

- Overturning ROE VS. WADE may lead to:
  
  - Many states passing anti-abortion laws
  - Setback for women's rights, particularly reproductive autonomy

- **JENNIFER BARBER's Research**:
  
  - 2/3 of young women who were positive about having a baby before pregnancy felt negatively after becoming pregnant
  - Main reason: their partners reacted negatively to the news of pregnancy
  - Women should have the right to change their mind
  - Without abortion rights, reproductive coercion may occur
  - Younger, less educated, and Asian women are more vulnerable to such coercion

## Global Gender Gap Report 2023 (164:45)

  - Economic gender gap: 39.9% (approximately 40%)
  - Largest gap: Political empowerment (77.9%, approximately 78%)

- **Regional Performance**:
  
  - Best performing: Europe (76.3% of gender gap closed)
  - Worst performing: Middle East and North Africa

- **Country Rankings**:
  
  - Best performer: Iceland (rank 1)

- **Mobile Global Gender Gap Report 2023** by GSM Association:
  
  - Women in India are 40% less likely than men to use mobile internet
  - Factors include:
    - Digital literacy issues
    - Resource constraints (when families can afford only one phone, men typically get it)
    - Social restrictions (some panchayats ban girls from carrying mobile phones)
