# Religious Revival and Fundamentalism

## INTRODUCTION TO RELIGIOUS REVIVAL AND FUNDAMENTALISM (01:15)

- **Opening Question**: Do you really see religion being absent from the life of the modern man? In fact, on the contrary, religion seems to be everywhere, everywhere all around and literally in your face.

- **Main Topic**: We are now talking about **religious revival and fundamentalism**

- **Relationship Between Concepts**: The two concepts are connected to each other, related to each other. We'll discuss them somewhat separately as well as together.

## UNDERSTANDING RELIGIOUS REVIVAL (02:33)

### Definition and Basic Concept

- **Religious Revival**: Literal meaning of the word revive - to literally come back to life. Viva refers to life. To revive means to once again come back to life.

- **Core Meaning**: Something which had become dead or declined is once again coming back to life. And what is that something? Religion.

- **Complete Definition**: Religion which was considered to have significantly declined with modernization is once again literally springing back to life. That is religious revival.

- **Opposite Relationship**: Religious revival is the opposite of secularization.

### Revival vs Secularization Comparison

| Concept           | Meaning                                                                                   | Direction      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Secularization    | Decline in religiosity, religion declined in social significance as society became modern | Downward trend |
| Religious Revival | Once again an upsurge or upswing in religiosity in social life                            | Upward trend   |

## REASONS FOR RELIGIOUS REVIVAL (04:35)

### Personal Level Motivations

Students in the class provided various reasons why modern, rational, scientific temperament individuals turn to religion:

- **Unanswered Questions**: For things to which science cannot give answers, people turn to religion
- **Peace of Mind**: Religion offers peace of mind
- **Crisis Support**: Support during times of crisis - religion offers crutches to rely upon
- **Moral Regulation**: Need for clarity regarding what is right and what is wrong, offered by religion
- **Fear of Uncertainty**: High degree of uncertainty in life, risk in life, causes modern people to turn to religion
- **Meaning and Purpose**: Religion gives meaning to life, gives a sense of purpose, higher purpose

## THE CONCEPT OF RESACRALIZATION (10:14)

### Sociological Definition

- **Resacralization**: The sociological term used for what in ordinary English we call religious revival

- **Definition**: Resacralization involves a resurgence of religion as a social force in contemporary times

- **Components**: Religious beliefs, practices, knowledge and institutions once again become important for the society

### Historical Context

- **Challenge to Secularization**: The concept of resacralization counters yet challenges the concept of secularization

- **Timeline**: If religion declined in social significance with the Renaissance and the enlightenment, it is once again becoming salient in the 20th and 21st centuries

- **Modern vs Postmodern**: With modernization there was decline of religion, and as western societies transitioned from modern to postmodern societies there is resacralization - sacred is again becoming important

### Contemporary Evidence

- **Increased Piety**: In today's times in different parts of the world there is increased piety
- **Religious Identity Assertion**: Assertion of one's religious identity  
- **Religious Gatherings**: Increased attendance in religious gatherings
- **Religious Tourism**: Increase in religious tourism

## THEORETICAL EXPLANATIONS FOR RELIGIOUS REVIVAL (16:41)

### BERGER and LUCKMAN's Invisible Religion

- **Human Nature**: People, human beings are inherently religious. We are intrinsically inclined towards religion

- **Invisible Religion Concept**: In modern times, with modernization, religion may not be too visible in the public sphere, but people continue to remain religious

- **Private Spirituality**: People continue to seek answers to their spiritual questions in private

### Dissatisfaction with Materialistic Hedonism (19:18)

- **Limited Satisfaction**: Material comforts, money, possessions are important, but only up to a point beyond which one again begins to wonder - is this what life is all about?

- **Emptiness**: One senses a sort of dissatisfaction, a sort of emptiness which cannot be filled by more money or more possessions

- **Western Context**: The western world by and large has attained high standards of living, but unlike us who are still struggling with bread and butter issues, they have largely overcome basic necessities and are increasingly turning to religion and spirituality

- **Examples**: 
  
  - People in the west endorsing eastern mysticism
  - ISKCON movement (International Sri Krishna Consciousness)
  - Transcendental Meditation movement by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
  - Various Babas like Osho

### Political Reasons (25:01)

- **Right-wing Political Parties**: There has been some sort of political assertion by right-wing political parties in different parts of the world

- **Growing Popularity**: There is growing popularity of right-wing political parties and these parties contribute to religious revival

- **Majority Identity Focus**: These right-wing political parties celebrate, glorify the religious identity of the majority demographic, not religious minorities

## CASE STUDY: HAGIA SOPHIA CONTROVERSY (27:33)

### Historical Background

- **Original Construction**: Hagia Sophia was initially built as a church or cathedral way back in the sixth century AD in Istanbul
- **Church Period**: For several centuries, it functioned as a church
- **Ottoman Conversion**: In the 15th century, when the area came under Ottoman Empire control, it was converted into a mosque
- **Museum Period**: After World War I, under Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Ataturk), it was converted into a museum in the 1930s
- **Symbol of Reconciliation**: It became a symbol of reconciliation between Muslims and Christians, and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site

### Recent Developments (2020)

- **Reconversion**: In 2020, the AKP government led by Erdogan declared Hagia Sophia to once again be a mosque
- **Support**: This decision was welcomed by countries like Pakistan, Iran, and other primarily Muslim majority countries
- **Criticism**: It invited widespread condemnation from Pope Francis, Greece, France, World Council of Churches, European Union, and UNESCO

### Analysis by KAREN BARKEY

- **Ataturk Regime Criticism**: The Ataturk regime was wrong in secularizing Hagia Sophia
- **Religious Endowments**: Religious endowments are perpetual and inviolable - it is not the business of a secular state to change the character of a place of worship
- **Government Role**: The government is not the owner but was at best a custodian of the mosque
- **Political Motivations**: The present decision to reconvert the museum into a mosque was driven by political considerations to mobilize support for the Islamist nationalist party, the AKP
- **Diversion Tactic**: The move is aimed at diverting people's attention from economic hardships
- **Negative Consequences**: It symbolizes Turkey drifting away from its secular basis and turning Islamic, can foster ill will between Christians and Muslims globally, ignores concerns of Turkey's religious minorities, and will hurt tourism

## HUNTINGTON'S CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS THEORY (43:30)

### Context and Background

- **Timeline**: This notion was developed in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet block and communism
- **Response to Fukuyama**: Huntington wrote about clash of civilizations as a response to Fukuyama's "End of History and the Last Man"
- **Fukuyama's Argument**: Suggested that with communism's collapse, the world would enter a new era of peace and prosperity with the victory of capitalism and liberal democracy

### Huntington's Counter-Argument

- **Continued Conflict**: The world will continue to be marred by conflict, and these conflicts will be between civilizations
- **Religious Identity**: A civilization is primarily characterized by its religious identity
- **Inevitability**: The clash of civilizations is somewhat inevitable

### Major Civilizations Identified

| Civilization  | Geographic Region                                    | Religious Base       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Western       | Europe, North America, Canada, Australia             | Primarily Christian  |
| Islamic       | North Africa, Middle East, up to Pakistan, Indonesia | Islam                |
| Hindu         | Primarily India, Nepal, and diaspora                 | Hinduism             |
| Buddhist      | Myanmar, Thailand, and other Buddhist countries      | Buddhism             |
| Sinic/Chinese | China                                                | Chinese civilization |

### Key Predictions

- **Religious Fundamentalism**: Religious identity is far more fundamental; differences between religious communities and belief systems are far more deeply ingrained
- **Western vs Islamic**: Particularly prophesized increasing conflict between the western civilization and the Islamic civilization
- **Alliance Prediction**: Prophesized an alliance between the Islamic civilization and the Sinic civilization against the western civilization

### Evidence of Theory

Examples supporting Huntington's prophecy include:

- Israel-Palestine conflict
- Salafi movement and Islamic terrorism
- 9/11 attacks and subsequent US retaliation in Afghanistan
- WMDs controversy in Iraq

## TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN RELIGIOUS REVIVAL (54:38)

### Positive Impact on Religious Revival

- **Counterintuitive Effect**: As technology has advanced (outcome of science), it has immensely contributed to religious revival
- **Wider Reach**: More people listen to religious sermons today than 50-100 years back due to widely available technology
- **Television Channels**: Scores of TV channels dedicated to religious sermons with very large viewership
- **Televangelists**: Popular figures like Zakir Naik, Baba Ramdev could not have reached their levels of popularity without technological innovations

### Improved Religious Pilgrimage

- **Easier Access**: Religious pilgrimage has become quicker, cheaper, easier thanks to technological innovations
- **Time Efficiency**: Travel to places like Vaishno Devi can now be completed in 2-3 days instead of several days
- **Cost Reduction**: Earlier only those with good amounts of money and time could afford pilgrimage; now it's more accessible
- **Modern Conveniences**: Travel by helicopter, online darshan, online prasads are all possible

## EXAMPLES OF MASSIVE RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS (59:01)

### Global Religious Gatherings Statistics

| Religion     | Event              | Attendance                 | Location            |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------- |

| Hinduism     | Kumbh Mela         | 24 crore people (2019)     | Prayagraj           |

- **Significance**: These massive gatherings represent a very public outpouring of religiosity across the globe and across denominations

## ISLAMIC REVIVAL IN THE 1970S (63:03)

### Context and Causes

- **Petro-Dollar Influence**: Middle Eastern countries stumbled upon oil reserves, leading to flow of petro-dollars
- **Financial Investment**: Large amounts of money became available with oil-producing Arab countries, some of which was channelized into Islamic revival

### Characteristics of Islamic Revival

- **Increased Piety**: Islamic revival has been marked by increase in piety and community feeling among Muslims
- **Cultural Emphasis**: Increased emphasis on adoption of Islamic culture and overt display of Islamic identity
- **Examples**: 
  - Muslim girls protesting to retain the right to wear hijab in schools
  - Wanting modern education while conforming to Islamic culture
- **Legal Implementation**: Imposition of Sharia in many Muslim majority countries
- **Lifestyle Focus**: Emphasis on adherence to Islamic values and lifestyle

## CHRISTIAN REVIVAL IN AMERICA (67:45)

### Characteristics of Christian Revival

## RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISM (75:07)

### Definition and Basic Understanding

- **Simple Definition**: Going to the basics, strong adherence to one's religious beliefs
- **Hindi Equivalent**: Fundamentalists are known as Qattar (कट्टर) - they're not open to change

### Liberal vs Fundamentalist Comparison

| Liberal Religious People                               | Fundamentalist Religious People                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Understand essence of religion, morals, main teachings | Insist upon rigidly, strictly following scriptures |
| Support literal adherence to scriptures                | Insist upon adherence to fundamentals of religion  |
| Suggest religion should adapt to changing times        | Consider scriptures as flawless and inviolable     |
| Open to reinterpretation and adaptation                | Not open to any reinterpretation or adaptation     |

### Sociological Definition of Religious Fundamentalism

- **Core Meaning**: To reaffirm or assert the key theological tenets of one's religion

- **Scripture Approach**: Fundamentalists consider that the religious scriptures of one's own religion provide clear guidelines which must be adhered to in totality

- **View of Scriptures**: The scriptures are regarded as flawless and final

- **Truth Claims**: According to fundamentalist movements, the truth as revealed in the scriptures of one's own religion is the only truth

- **Divine Nature**: Scriptures are considered as divine revelation or the word of God, and therefore beyond any modification and beyond questioning

### Conflict Patterns of Fundamentalists

Fundamentalists tend to clash with:

1. **Other Religions**: Muslim fundamentalists will oppose Hindu scriptures because for them, only the Holy Quran contains pure, final truth
2. **Liberals of Their Own Faith**: They oppose those who suggest adapting scriptures to changing times
3. **Scientific Community**: Because scriptures contain content that clashes with scientific teachings

### Examples of Science-Religion Conflicts

**Christian Fundamentalism vs Science:**

- God created man in his own image vs Evolution theory
- Virgin birth of Christ vs Scientific impossibility
- Christ rose from the dead vs Scientific impossibility  
- Christ performed miracles vs Science says miracles are not possible

## SCHOLARLY PERSPECTIVES ON FUNDAMENTALISM (89:15)

### ANTHONY GIDDENS' View

**Characteristics of Fundamentalists:**

- Seek a return to the fundamentals
- Consider their own viewpoint as the only correct one
- Justify their viewpoint by referring to the scriptures
- Avoid contact or clash with those who hold other views
- Are not accommodating - "my way or the highway" attitude

### MACIONIS' Perspective

**Fundamentalist Traits:**

- Interpret the scriptures literally
- Do not accept religious pluralism and secularism  
- Mostly endorse conservative political positions

**Political Alignment:** Hindu fundamentalists support parties like BJP, believing in concepts like Hindu Rashtra

## CAUSES OF RISE OF FUNDAMENTALISM (93:00)

### T.N. MADAN's Analysis

- **Modern Society Context**: Fundamentalism exists or arises in modern societies or modernizing society
- **Historical Absence**: Fundamentalism did not exist in traditional society
- **Reaction Against Modernization**: Fundamentalism arises as a reaction against modernization
- **Threat Response**: Modernization tends to threaten religion by contributing to its decline, so fundamentalism emerges as a reaction against the decimation and sidelining of religion

### ANSON SHUPE's Perspective

- **Globalization Response**: Fundamentalism is a response to globalization and the marginalization of religion
- **Cultural Homogenization**: With globalization, American culture has become preponderant across the globe
- **Reaction Pattern**: When globalization advances with its homogenizing tendency, people react by growing attachment to their own religion
- **Cultural Preservation**: It's a reaction against the homogenizing tendency of globalization

### ANTHONY GIDDENS' Late Modernity Theory

- **Late Modernity**: Postmodern society (after 1950s) is characterized by very high levels of risk and uncertainty
- **Uncertainty Examples**: The pandemic showed how uncertain times can be - nobody knew what lay ahead
- **Need for Anchor**: In times of high uncertainty, people seek some sort of stability, some sort of anchor
- **Religion as Stability**: Religion provides that anchor, that source of stability, a source of identity in highly uncertain times

### STEVE BRUCE's Multi-Factor Analysis

**Additional factors contributing to fundamentalism:**

1. **Common External Enemy**: Presence of a common external enemy encourages fundamentalist movements
   
   - Examples: Taliban perceiving the West/US as enemy; Jewish fundamentalists seeing Hamas as threat

2. **Pool of Potential Recruits**: Fundamentalist movements require foot soldiers, typically from disprivileged/disadvantaged sections of society

3. **Political Party Encouragement**: Political parties may encourage religious fundamentalism because it helps mobilize public opinion in their favor

4. **State Preference**: Fundamentalist movements seek to establish a theocratic state where their religion is the majority (but oppose theocracy where they are minorities)

5. **Single Sacred Text**: Religions with a single sacred text have greater propensity to give birth to fundamentalist movements due to greater possibility of ideological cohesion

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCIENCE AND RELIGION (109:14)

### Fundamental Differences

| Science                                          | Religion                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Relies completely on hard facts                  | Not based on facts                            |
| Empirical basis                                  | Based on faith, custom, revelation            |
| Universal laws applicable everywhere             | Culture specific, people specific             |
| Promotes questioning and skepticism              | Demands blind adherence, unquestioned faith   |
| Nothing is sacred, everything can be questioned  | Has sacred elements that cannot be questioned |
| Unites humanity                                  | Often divides humanity                        |
| Rational                                         | Non-rational                                  |
| Based on reason and logic                        | Based on scriptures and revelation            |
| Involves data, experiment, verification          | Based on unquestioned obedience               |
| Inherent flexibility, openness to transformation | Far more rigid, unwilling to change           |
| Organized skepticism built into the system       | Expects unquestioned obedience                |

### Historical Relationship

- **Pre-modern Society**: Religion dominated social life
- **Modern Society**: Scientific knowledge and temperament became hallmarks
- **Domain Competition**: As the domain of science expands, the domain of religion shrinks correspondingly
- **Superior Solutions**: Science offers superior, better, more accurate, more verifiable, more result-oriented solutions and explanations

### Religious Opposition to Science

- **Organized Religion's Stance**: The church and organized religion have frequently seen scientific advancement as a threat to their credibility and hold over society

- **Galileo Affair Example**: 
  
  - Galileo Galilei endorsed the heliocentric model (sun at center)
  - Holy Bible/Christian clergy interpreted Bible to endorse geocentric model (earth at center)
  - Since Galileo's theory debunked what the church upheld, they persecuted and jailed him

### Concluding Perspective

- **Parallel Systems**: "East is east and west is west and the twain shall never meet" - science and religion are opposing, conflicting knowledge systems and methodologies that run parallel to each other into infinity
- **Clash Upon Meeting**: If they ever meet, they clash
