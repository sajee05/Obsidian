# Contemporary Trends in Marriage and Family

## Correction on Previous Lecture Content (33:28)

- **Important Correction**: In the previous lecture, it was mentioned that 50% of American children are living in step families - this was incorrect
- **Accurate Figure**: 15-16% of American children below the age of 13 years are living in what we prefer to call **blended families** instead of step families
- **Definition of Blended Families**: Families with either a step parent or a step sibling or some step relationship, effectively meaning step families only, but "blended families" is the preferred term used in literature and research studies

## Diversity in Marriage and Family (37:40)

### The Serial Packet Image of the Family

- **EDMUND LEECH's Concept**: The "serial packet image of the family" refers to the cliched stereotypical portrayal of a perfect family
- **Characteristics**: Shows a heterosexual couple with children - a man as the breadwinner with a beautiful wife and children
- **Reality Check**: This is not how the typical family actually looks; it's a very idealized version of what we like to believe is the typical family
- **Social Reality**: In the real social world, there is far greater diversity in forms of family and types of living arrangements that people have

### Examples of Family Diversity

- Woman living with an old woman and younger children
- Same-sex couples as family
- Many people living all by themselves
- Group of men (brothers, cousins, etc.) staying together
- Inter-racial families
- Inter-religious families

## Global Trend of Family Diversity (41:32)

- **RHONDA RAPAPORT** suggests that family diversity is a global trend across the globe
- Various types of living arrangements and relationships exist not just in one country but globally, including in India
- Nowhere would you have those serial packet images of the family being the dominant form

### Statistical Evidence from England (1961-2010)

| Family Type                             | 1961 | 2010 |
| --------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Married couples with dependent children | 38%  | 21%  |
| Single person households                | 29%  | 30%  |
| Single parent families                  | -    | 7%   |

- Only 1/5th of all families have traditional arrangements; the rest 80% are other types of arrangements

## Interracial and Interreligious Marriages in the US (45:39)

### Interracial Marriages

| Year | Percentage of Newlyweds |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 1967 | 3%                      |
| 2015 | 17%                     |

### Interreligious Marriages

| Year | Percentage of Newlyweds |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 1967 | 19%                     |
| 2015 | 39%                     |

- **Key Point**: Marriages do not conform to that cliched stereotypical portrayal of a man and woman of the same race and religion or social background with dependent children
- There is far more complexity and variation in marriage forms and patterns

## Same-Sex Marriages Debate (47:27)

### Arguments Against Same-Sex Marriages

#### Cultural and Religious Arguments

- **Sanctity of Marriage**: The sanctity of the institution of marriage will be lost
- **Hindu Cultural Perspective**: In Hindu culture, marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman
- **Natural Order**: Biology dictates that men should copulate with women; homosexual intercourse is unnatural
- **Western Influence**: Homosexuality is a corrupting influence of western culture

#### Health and Social Concerns

- **Multiple Partners**: Gays don't have their libido in control and have multiple sex partners
- **Disease Prevalence**: Greater prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS
- **Predatory Behavior**: Gays are predatory with unduly sexual advances, posing a threat to children's safety and wellbeing

#### Societal Impact Arguments

- **Child Welfare**: Unhealthy for the full emotional, psychological wellbeing and development of children
- **Parent Figures**: Child requires both a mother figure and a father figure; two mothers or two fathers cannot make up for the absence of the other parent
- **Slippery Slope**: Once the "my body, my rules" argument is accepted, it can lead to justification of bestiality, necrophilia, pedophilia, and other sexual perversions

#### Population and Priority Concerns

- **Minuscule Population**: According to NACO, there are 25 lakh MSM (Men who have Sex with Men), literally a drop in the ocean
- **Bigger Challenges**: Society should focus on far bigger challenges like women empowerment issues affecting half of India's population, 20% population below poverty line

### Arguments in Favor of Same-Sex Marriages

#### Constitutional Rights

- **Fundamental Rights**: Right to live under Article 21 of the Constitution
- **Personal Liberty**: Undue interference in the personal lives of gay couples
- **Constitutional Equality**: If we believe in the Constitution of India, numbers shouldn't matter - even a single homosexual should have rights

#### Cultural Arguments

- **Indian Heritage**: Indian culture was extremely modern; there are paintings and sculptures in Ajanta and Ellora showing same-sex relationships
- **Historical Context**: The KAMASUTRA, written 2000 years before Christ, described same-sex marriages
- **Progressive Culture**: We are a progressive culture, not bound by traditional values propagated by current flag bearers

#### Logical Counterpoints

- **Child Abuse Reality**: Sexual abuse is prevalent in heterosexual marriages too (53% of children face sexual abuse according to a 2007 study by Ministry of Women and Child Development and UN Children's Fund)
- **Public Display**: Even heterosexuals engage in public displays of affection in places like Delhi Metro
- **Social Evolution**: Culture is dynamic; why should we presume Indian culture to be what it was 2,000 years back?

## Legal Evolution in India (57:25)

- **Common Ground**: All supported criminalizing homosexuality on grounds that it's against their religious teachings

## Health Statistics and Concerns (73:07)

### HIV Prevalence Rates (NACO Data)

- **MSM (Men who have Sex with Men)**: 4.4%
- **Female Sex Workers**: 2.6%
- **Significance**: HIV prevalence amongst gay men is far higher than amongst prostitutes

- **Conducting Bodies**: Ministry of Women and Child Development, UN Children's Fund, NGO PRIAS
- **Key Finding**: 53% of children had faced sexual abuse
- **Gender Breakdown**: 53% of the abused children were boys

## Homophobia and Heteronormativity (105:00)

### Definition of Homophobia

- **Homophobic Understanding**: View that homosexuality is unnatural, abhorrent, repulsive, sinful, immoral, and perverted sexual behavior
- **Prevalence**: Widely prevalent in heteronormative societies including ours

### Heteronormativity

- **Definition**: The belief or assumption that heterosexual behavior is normal, natural, morally correct, and the default setting for human beings
- **Social Structure**: Considers that the man-woman unit is the building block of social life
- **Institutional Support**: This man-woman union must be preserved, promoted, and privileged through law, religion, media, government regulation, etc.

## Queer Theory (106:09)

### Basic Concepts

- **QUEER THEORY**: Developed in the 1990s, deals with alternative sexualities and alternative gender identities
- **Word Origin**: "Queer" literally means odd or weird, not regular
- **Core Argument**: Gender identity and human sexuality are not fixed and rigid; instead, they are fluid and dynamic

### Key Theorists

- **JUDITH BUTLER**: Challenges heteronormativity and argues that gender and sexuality are fluid
- **Challenge to Assumptions**: Questions the assumption that we are all heterosexual, which is considered normal sexual behavior

### Research Evidence

- **KINSEY REPORTS** (1948, 1953): Studies of human sexual behavior in America
  - 46% of male respondents had reacted sexually to both sexes
  - 10% of American males were exclusively homosexual for at least 3 years
- **UK Survey (2015)**: Only 72% of UK population were fully heterosexual
- **Japan Survey**: 7.6% were exclusively homosexual

### Animal Behavior Research

- **BRUCE BAGEL's Study**: Homosexual behavior is prevalent in more than 450 different species of animals, reptiles, and birds
- **Species Range**: From dogs and cats to chimpanzees, lions, elephants, dolphins, sparrows, lizards, and cockroaches

## Historical Perspective on Western Homophobia (142:09)

### MICHAEL FOUCAULT's Analysis

- **Book**: "History of Sexuality"
- **Historical Timeline**: Before the 18th century, debates on sexuality concerned heterosexual behavior of married couples for reproduction
- **18th Century Shift**: West started taking interest in the "world of perversion" - any sexual behavior other than for reproduction
- **Criminalization**: Homosexuality was made illegal and began to be seen as a danger to society
- **Authority Figures**: Government and police emerged as authority figures controlling people's sexual lives

### Medicalization (1860s)

- **Medical Illness**: Homosexuality began to be viewed as a medical illness
- **New Authority**: Doctors and psychiatrists emerged as authority figures trying to find a cure for homosexuality

### GAIL RUBIN's Erotic Pyramid

- **Concept**: Hierarchy showing how different sexual behaviors are accorded different amounts of social prestige

| Level  | Sexual Behavior                                          |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Top    | Married heterosexual monogamous couples                  |
| 2nd    | Unmarried heterosexual monogamous couples                |
| 3rd    | Other heterosexuals/straight couples with stability      |
| 4th    | Gay male couples in stable and long-term relationships   |
| 5th    | Bar dykes and promiscuous gay men                        |
| 6th    | Transvestites, transsexuals, sadomasochists, sex workers |
| Bottom | Those who cross age barriers                             |

## Indian Cultural Context (117:11)

### Historical Acceptance

- **RUTH VANITA and SALEEM KIDWAI**: Book "Same-Sex Love in India"
- **Historical Evidence**: Throughout Indian history, numerous references to same-sex love in medieval ruler codes, ancient literature
- **Sanskrit Wisdom**: "Vikriti Evam Prakriti" - that which seems unnatural is also natural
- **Cultural Ethos**: Indian culture has been always all-embracing rather than excluding certain sexualities or genders from social life

### Mythological References

- **DEVDUTT PATTANAIK**: Book "Shikhandi and Other Tales That They Don't Tell You"
- **Same-Sex Love vs. Activity**: Indian culture distinguishes between same-sex love and same-sex sexual activity
- **Celebrated Examples**: 
  - Love between Lord Krishna and Sudama
  - Love in Bharat Milap scene when Lord Ram meets Bharat
  - Devotee Hanuman's love for Lord Ram

### Mythological Same-Sex Unions

- **Harihara Putra**: Child of Shiva and Vishnu (in Mohini form)
- **Sage Bhagiratha**: Born of two mothers
- **Lord Varuna and Lord Mitra**: Share great intimacy

### Western Import Argument

- **Homophobia as Western Import**: Fear of homosexuals is a western import, not native to Indian culture
- **Section 377**: Introduced during colonial period (1860s) as product of Victorian morality and British homophobic Christianity
- **Story of Sodom**: Christian concept where homosexuality is considered sinful

## Indian LGBT Rights Movement (154:25)

### Historical Timeline

| Period             | Development                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Early 20th Century | First writings on homosexuality began                                  |

| 1990s              | LGBT rights movement gained momentum                                   |

### GANDHI's Position

- **Stance**: Condemned homosexuality in "Young India"
- **Reasoning**: Said it was due to lack of moral education that such perverse sexual behavior was taking place

### 1990s Developments

- **SUPARNA BHASKARAN's Analysis**: Maturation of queer consciousness in India coincided with:
  - Economic reforms (LPG reforms)
  - Increasing cultural contact with Indian diaspora  
  - Advent of satellite TV

- **Academic Literature**: Works by RUTH VANITA, SALEEM KIDWAI
- **Film Festivals**: Queer film festivals started

- **Ended Isolation**: People realized they weren't alone or abnormal
- **Services Provided**: 
  - Psychological counseling
  - Facilitated coming out
  - Health checkups and drives
  - Safe sex education
  - Activism coordination

## Contemporary Perspectives (164:00)

### Chosen Families

- **JEFFREY WEEKS**: Same-sex couples view their families as "chosen families"
- **Definition**: Not necessarily based on blood ties; you choose whom you want to regard as family
- **Example**: If blood relatives don't respect your sexuality, you may treat accepting friends or even landlords as family

### Social Changes

- **SASHA ROSENEIL**: Same-sex unions challenge heteronormativity and lead to increasing acceptance of alternative sexualities and family forms
- **Blurred Lines**: Distinction between intimacy and friendship has blurred
- **Flexibility**: Someone who's your friend today may tomorrow be a sexual partner, then again friends

### Class Analysis

- **MAYA SHARMA's Studies**: Highlighted the plight of poor working-class lesbian women in India
- **Myth Busting**: Dispels the myth that gay rights is only a concern of privileged sections

### Criticism of Movement

- **ASHLEY TELLIS**: Critical of LGBT rights movement in India
- **Narrow Focus**: Movement has focused mainly on legal issues (decriminalization, right to marry)
- **Ignored Concerns**: Bulk of LGBT community belonging to different castes, classes, gender identities have concerns beyond legal framework

## Conclusion (172:20)

- **Complexity**: Legalizing gay marriages is a complex issue with multiple factors to consider
- **Government Position**: Government of India has opposed legalization of same-sex marriages in Supreme Court
- **Ongoing Dialogue**: Must sustain dialogue keeping in view concerns of LGBT community members
- **Framework**: Need to go beyond the heteronormative framework
