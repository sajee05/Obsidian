## Guest Speaker Session - AK MAHARA (13:26)

### Speaker Introduction
- **AK MAHARA** - IRS officer, 1984 batch
- Former Principal Commissioner  
- UPSC Board Member since 2 years

### Core Philosophy and Motivation

- **Fundamental belief:** "Anybody can clear IAS exams - it is not difficult at all"
- **Key requirement:** Anyone with above average IQ is competent to reach the final stage
- **Essential mindset:** Must have confidence in oneself

### The Challenge and Reality

- **Main difficulty:** Not the exam content itself, but the large number of candidates
- **Competition:** Need to be best among others when 50% of students may be at par or better than you
- **Available seats:** Approximately 1,000-1,200 seats annually (numbers vary each year)
- **Success rate:** Very low percentage of successful candidates

### Preparation Strategy and Mindset

- **Total commitment required:** This is a full-time job requiring 24-hour focus on eating, sleeping, and thinking about preparation
- **Focus principle:** "Focus. Focus. Focus. You will be able to reach the final destination"
- **Work-life balance:** Some time for unwinding and parties is acceptable, but primary focus must remain constant

### Study Approach

- **Foundation importance:** Strong basics from 10th to 12th standard are crucial
- **Knowledge requirement:** Need to be "Jack of all trades" with knowledge of everything, unlike PhD specialists who focus on one area
- **Content strategy:** Should have little bit of knowledge about everything
- **Reading approach:** Must read and remember in bullet points for reproduction in exams

### Subject Background Considerations

- **Engineering vs Arts students:** Engineers capture most seats, but arts students should not feel disadvantaged
- **Optimal background:** Political science, sociology, and history backgrounds can be advantageous
- **Career switching:** Many candidates switch from engineering/medical to humanities subjects for better preparation

### Self-Assessment and Determination

- **Self-belief importance:** "I can do it" attitude is essential
- **Personal conviction:** Must know clearly why you want this career
- **Circumstances management:** Despite financial or other constraints, maintain "I have to do it and I will do it" attitude
- **Clarity requirement:** Must be very clear in your mind about your goals

## Toppers' Journey Sharing Sessions

### JATIN JEN's Experience (33:48)

- **Experience relevance:** Notes that despite 30-40 years gap since 1984, most UPSC demands remain the same
- **Competition analysis:** Out of 14,000-15,000 who clear prelims, perhaps 5,000 constitute real competition
- **Self-awareness importance:** Knowing yourself and your competition is crucial
- **Optional subject significance:** Taking proper guidance for optional subjects and getting test evaluations is essential
- **Preparation standards:** Should aim for above average standards, focusing on relevant content
- **Current affairs integration:** Must link current affairs with subject-specific knowledge, particularly for sociology
- **Beyond textbooks:** Do not restrict yourself to books only; learn to look beyond that
- **Confidence building:** Through proper preparation, abilities will automatically develop, leading to acceptance of failures and embracing success equally

### Second Topper's Insights (39:11)

- **Planning importance:** Proper planning and strategy are core requirements for clearing the examination
- **Self-honesty:** Being honest with yourself is very important for growth and improvement
- **Acceptance principle:** Acceptance of weaknesses is crucial - "You will never grow and never improve" without it
- **Practical approach:** Perfection through practice, mock tests, and answer evaluation are important
- **Guidance necessity:** Correct mentorship and guidance are essential components

### SUSHMITA's Journey - Six Attempts Experience (44:17)

#### Personal Background and Allocation
- **Service allocation:** Recently received IPS allocation
- **Home state:** Chennai
- **Attempt history:** Succeeded in sixth attempt after facing many ups and downs

#### Detailed Attempt History
- **First attempt (2017):** Reached personality test stage but could not secure selection
- **Second and third attempts:** Could not clear prelims  
- **Fourth attempt:** Again reached personality test stage
- **Fifth attempt:** Could not clear prelims
- **Sixth attempt:** Successfully landed in IPS service

#### Key Insights and Mental Preparation

- **Mistake analysis:** No serious mistakes in failed attempts - exam tests mental strength more than preparation
- **Mental battle reality:** "This is a test of your mental ability. You have to stay calm and composed throughout the process"
- **Day performance:** Must be at your best during the actual exam hours - two hours for prelims, three hours for mains, and half hour for personality test
- **Preparation vs Performance:** Even with right strategy and preparation, D-day performance is crucial

#### Examination Relevance to Civil Services

- **Real-world connection:** Strong relevance between examination and actual civil services work
- **Essay writing utility:** Essay paper helps in drafting replies to MLAs and attracting attention to demands
- **Prelims uncertainty management:** Recent years show changing question patterns requiring adaptation with limited resources
- **Resource limitation training:** Similar to civil service work where limited resources and time require excellent performance

#### Values and Attitude Development

- **Civil servant mindset:** Should have attitude of being "a civil servant in making" during preparation itself
- **Molding process:** Process of becoming civil servant starts during preparation, not after clearing exam
- **Perseverance and determination:** These values are tested during the examination process itself
- **Long-term perspective:** Years of preparation contribute to cumulative knowledge reflected in personality test
- **Positive attitude maintenance:** Multiple attempts should not be viewed as waste of time - knowledge accumulates and helps

#### Success Strategy and Mental Approach

- **Immediate success mindset:** Prepare with attitude of cracking in the same year
- **Mental battle preparation:** After expecting results, consider it as mental battle requiring success
- **Example learning:** Take inspiration from candidates who succeeded after multiple attempts
- **Determination requirement:** Stay determined with strong willpower and internal inspiration

### NAVITA KUMARI's Working Professional Journey (51:51)

#### Professional Background
- **Education:** Chemical Engineering background
- **Work experience:** Decade of experience with campus placement in TATA Chemicals Limited, currently working with Shell UK

- **Time management:** Major challenge being in private sector with demanding schedule
- **Attempt history:** First attempt in 2018, succeeded after 5-6 years of cycle
- **Job continuation:** Recommends assessing whether UPSC preparation is doable with job or not

#### Specific Changes and Improvements

- **Forest services success:** Cleared forest and civil services in same preparation cycle
- **Previous year questions strategy:** Attempted all questions from last 20 years, including all options analysis
- **Integrated preparation:** Syllabus was complete for mains but never did answer writing before prelims
- **Post-prelims approach:** Started answer writing only after clearing prelims

#### Subject-Specific Guidance

- **GS preparation:** Value addition through current affairs and newspapers for each GS paper
- **Innovation requirement:** Try to do some innovation in every GS question for at least one mark
- **Resource optimization:** Don't refer to too many resources; identify relevant and suitable ones with multiple revisions
- **Retention strategy:** Multiple revisions help retain information better than excessive new material

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Over-preparation:** Don't overdo preparation; keep it minimum with multiple revisions
- **Test importance:** Don't ignore giving tests and evaluation
- **Sociology guidance:** Recommends taking proper guidance for sociology optional even without background
- **Determination maintenance:** Stay determined, keep willpower strong with internal inspiration
