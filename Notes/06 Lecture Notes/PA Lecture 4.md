- Sense of security and continuity associated with old order was replaced by uncertainty

**Birth of sociology:**

- Centuries-long period leading to substantial changes in people's ways of thinking
- Changes in arts, literature, science, economy
- Society was being prepared for revolutions since times of RENAISSANCE

- **Renaissance**: Rebirth of ancient GREEK and ROMAN culture and literature
- **Enlightenment**: Age of reason providing intellectual framework
