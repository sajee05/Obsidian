# UPSC Sociology Paper 1: Functionalism and Durkheim's Theory of Religion

## RECAP: POSITIVISM AND ANTI-POSITIVISM (12:24)

### Positivism 
- **Positivism**: Scientific approach can be applied to the study of society
- **Scientific method principles** (championed by positivists):
  1. Universal - same method should be used across all sciences
  2. Based on empirical data
  3. Objective and empirically testable
  4. Purpose is to make generalizations that would make future outcomes predictable

- **Founder**: AUGUSTE COMTE
- **Key Work**: "A Course in Positive Philosophy"

### Anti-Positivism
- **Core argument**: Sociology is not a scientific study because sociology cannot employ the scientific method because man has consciousness and that makes us very different from things (the subject matter of the natural sciences)
- **Key points**:
  - There are no patterns governing human behavior, so we can't make any generalizations
  - Using the scientific method, you will only be capturing the part of the reality which is observable
  - Cannot capture people's emotions, their meanings and motives through the scientific method

- **Key scholar**: WEBER (starting point of anti-positivism)
  - Does not completely denounce the scientific method
  - Argues it is not sufficient to study the whole of social reality
  - Needs to be coupled with other techniques as well

### Problems in Using Scientific Method in Sociological Research

1. **Problem of experimentation**:
   - Ethical dilemmas in conducting experiments
   - People might have privacy concerns
   - Many areas of social life are not open to or amenable to experimentation
   - Difficult to have a lab-type controlled environment

2. **Lack of standardized units of measurement**:
   - Prevents mathematization, quantification and processing of data
   - Necessary to make it more scientific

3. **Problem of generalization**:
   - Human behavior research is culture specific, society specific
   - Cannot have universal type generalizations

4. **Problem of objectivity**:
   - **Objectivity definition** (by ROBERT BIERSTEDT): Conclusions arrived at as a result of inquiry are independent of the caste, creed, religion, nationality of the researcher

### Various Positions on Objectivity

| Position | Scholars | View |
|----------|----------|------|
| Positivist | - | Sociology is objective |
| Anti-positivist | DEREK PHILLIPS, ALVIN GOULDNER | Research is influenced by values of researcher at every stage |
| Middle ground | WEBER | Selection of topic is value relevant, but subsequent steps should be value neutral |
| Critical researchers | LEE HARVEY, PHIL CARSPECKEN | Sociologists should become the voice of the voiceless and marginalized sections. Should have clear value preference |

### Enhancing Value Neutrality
- Acknowledging researcher's values
- Not omitting any data which contradicts your own beliefs

## THEORY OF FUNCTIONALISM (39:44)

### Basic Premise
- **Functionalism**: Theory which sees society as largely being characterized by cooperation and harmony
- Made possible because there exists a **value consensus** in society
- **Value consensus**: Broad agreement amongst members of society of what is worthwhile and what is not, what is right and what is not

### Shared Norms and Values
- **Values**: Broad or overarching principles of what we consider worthwhile (e.g., collectivism in India, individualism in America)
- **Norms**: Very specific guidelines for human conduct in different situations
  - Society tells us what we have to do in every situation
  - Examples: dress/clothing norms (gender appropriate, age appropriate, situation specific), food norms, social interaction norms

### Socialization and Social Control

**Socialization**: Process through which members of society are taught the ways of society

**Agencies of socialization**:
- Family
- Education system  
- Religion
- Mass media
- Law and order/government agencies
- Peers and friends

**Social Control Mechanisms**:
1. **Positive control**: Rewarding compliant behavior (formal recognition, awards, informal praise)
2. **Negative control**: Punishments for errant behavior (formal: law; informal: teasing, mocking, social boycott)

### Society as System of Parts
- Society comprises various social institutions (like different parts of society or social organism)
- Different social institutions perform various functions
- **Function**: The contribution that a social institution makes to the maintenance and well-being of the society as a whole

**Examples of institutional functions**:
- **Family**: Reproduction, satisfaction of sexual needs, socialization of children
- **Economy**: Production and distribution of goods and services  
- **Political system**: Make laws, maintain law and order, governance
- **Education**: Socialization, impart knowledge
- **Religion**: Fulfill spiritual needs, instill faith, build unity

### Key Characteristics
- While performing their respective functions, different parts of society are interrelated and interdependent
- Social life characterized by: consensus, cooperation, continuity, integration, harmony and stability

## CRITICISMS OF FUNCTIONALISM (95:37)

### Major Criticisms

1. **Ignores conflict, exploitation, oppression, violence**
   - Theory uses positive sounding words but ignores the "man eat man world"
   - Downplays role of conflict and exploitation in social life

2. **Assumes value consensus rather than establishing it**
   - Often represents values of dominant sections as values of whole society
   - Example: Anti-beef eating norms represent Hindu values, but many lower castes and Muslims consume beef

3. **Status quoist - discourages change**
   - Simply looks at positive contributions of all arrangements in society
   - Legitimizes existing arrangements by listing their functions
   - Examples: Listing functions of caste system, women's expressive role in family, social inequality, poverty

4. **Ignores agency of the individual**
   - Individual portrayed as completely controlled by society
   - Views individuals as "cultural dopes" or robots
   - No agency, free will, or choice in actions
   - As if playing out predetermined script handed by society

5. **Teleology**: Confusing or equating causes and functions
   - **Teleology**: To equate causes and functions (two should be treated separately)
   - Causes are historical (chronologically first), functions come after institution has appeared
   - Example: Saying witchcraft exists because it's functional, and it's functional because it exists (circular argument)

6. **Tautology**: Explaining things in repetitive, unnecessary manner
   - **Tautology**: Saying something repetitive and therefore unnecessary
   - Examples: "beautiful damsel" (damsel already means beautiful woman), "sunset in evening", "poverty exists because poor don't have money"

| Criticism Type | Description | Impact |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Conflict blindness | Ignores exploitation and oppression | Creates rose-tinted view of society |
| False consensus | Assumes dominant values are universal | Marginalizes minority perspectives |
| Status quo bias | Legitimizes existing arrangements | Prevents necessary social change |
| Individual agency denial | Views people as social robots | Underestimates human choice and creativity |
| Logical fallacies | Teleology and tautology | Weakens analytical rigor |

## INTRODUCTION TO EMILE DURKHEIM (133:32)

### Biographical Background
- **Period**: 1858-1917
- **Nationality**: French
- **Family background**: Jewish family, family members were rabbis (Jewish priests)
- **Education**: Philosophy, educated at ENS (École Normale Supérieure) which propagated enlightenment ideas
- **Views**: Secular and progressive due to education

## DURKHEIM'S THEORY OF RELIGION (140:59)

### Study Methodology
- **Book**: "The Elementary Forms of Religious Life"
- **Studied**: ARUNTA TRIBE (primitive Australian tribe)
- **Why Arunta tribe?**: 
  - Major world religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism) are very complex, well-developed, old
  - Large-sized societies with complex social organization
  - Arunta people were small-scale, simple, primitive society
  - Their religious beliefs and practices would also be simple
- **Criticism**: Never visited Australia or interacted with the tribe, relied on secondary sources

### Durkheim's Definition of Religion
- **Notable**: Definition does not contain any notion of supernatural or God
- **Religion**: "A unified system of beliefs and practices related to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden"

### Sacred vs Profane Classification
- **Key concept**: In every society, members divide their whole world into either of two categories: **Sacred** or **Profane**
- All things, beings, phenomena, entities would be either sacred or profane

**Sacred**: 
- Things set apart and forbidden
- Certain exclusivity, "touch me not" kind of thing
- Kept apart with detailed rules and regulations governing interaction

**Profane**:
- That which is not sacred  
- The ordinary, the mundane
- Those of everyday encounters and everyday utility
- No special rules or restrictions for interaction

### Examples of Sacred vs Profane

| Category | Sacred Examples | Profane Examples |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Spaces | Temple/prayer room | Bedroom, living room |
| Plants | Tulsi plant | Eucalyptus tree |
| Animals | Cow (Hindu society) | Camel |
| Objects | Sacred thread | T-shirt |
| Liquids | Ganga water | Tap water |
| Colors | Saffron/Bhagwa | Magenta |

### Rules for Sacred Things
- Cannot enter sacred spaces casually
- Must remove footwear
- Must bow down with respect  
- Hands should be washed/clean
- Must take bath before entering
- Detailed rules and regulations govern interaction

**Note**: Profane things are not bad, they are just ordinary, mundane, for everyday casual usage.
