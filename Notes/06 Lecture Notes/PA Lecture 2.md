# Nature of the Discipline of Sociology - Lecture Notes

## Review of Previous Lecture (16:32)

### Basic Definitions and Concepts
- **Sociology**: The systematic and scientific study of society
- **Term coined by**: AUGUST COMTE in the year 1838, comprising of two words - Latin word "socius" (meaning companion or ally) and Greek word "logos"
- **Earlier term used**: AUGUSTE COMTE first used the term "social physics" and later called it sociology

### Social Groups Classification

#### Primary and Secondary Groups (C.H. COOLEY)
- **Primary Groups**: 
  - Small in size
  - Close relationships
  - Strong emotional nexus or connection between members
  - Examples: Family, group of close friends
  
- **Secondary Groups**:
  - Larger in size  
  - Less frequent interaction
  - More formal and impersonal kind of relationships
  - Examples: Large organizations like NGOs, colleges, offices, trade unions

#### In-groups and Out-groups (WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER)
- **In-groups**: Those social groups where members have a strong sense of affinity or belonging, characterized by "we feeling"
  - Example: Indian army (for an Indian soldier)
  
- **Out-groups**: A group towards which an individual has a strong sense of hostility, enmity, aversion or competition
  - Example: Pakistani army or Chinese army (for an Indian soldier)

#### Membership and Non-membership Groups
- **Membership Groups**: Those groups of which the individual is a member
  - Example: Teachers (for a teacher), Hindu community (for a Hindu)
  
- **Non-membership Groups**: Those groups of which an individual is not a member
  - Example: Cricketers (for a non-cricketer), Muslims or Christians (for a Hindu)

### Important Distinctions

| Category Comparison | Same or Different? | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| In-groups vs Membership Groups | Different | In-group requires psychological affinity; membership is just belonging. Example: Hindu community may be membership group but not in-group if no strong psychological attachment |
| Out-groups vs Non-membership Groups | Different | Out-group requires hostility/aversion; non-membership is just not belonging. Example: Indian cricket team is non-membership group for most but not out-group |

## Social Relationships and Personal Acquaintance (47:06)

### Key Understanding
- **Personal acquaintance is not necessary for a social relationship to exist**
- Example: Relationship between citizens and political leadership (like MODI JI)
  - Political leaders don't know individual citizens personally
  - Yet citizens' existence affects leaders' behavior in public domain
  - Leaders' decisions affect citizens' lives (education, healthcare, taxes, infrastructure)

### Examples of Social Relationships Without Personal Acquaintance
- Fans and celebrities
- Voters and political representatives
- Citizens and government officials

## Social Institutions (66:44)

### Definition and Formation
- **Social Institutions**: Arise from recurrent and patterned social relationships
- **According to GINSBURG**: Social institution refers to recognized and established usages governing relations between individuals and between groups

### Examples of Social Institution Formation

| Social Relationships | Resulting Institution |
|---|---|
| Husband-wife, parent-child, sibling relationships | Family |
| Ruler-ruled, ruling party-opposition, legislators-executive | Political System/Polity |
| Employer-employee, buyer-seller, worker relationships | Economy/Economic System |
| Hierarchical social arrangements | Stratification System |

### Stratification System
- **Definition**: The system of inequality in society - how society is divided into different hierarchically arranged social groups or classes
- **Examples**:
  - Class system: Rich, poor, middle class divisions based on wealth
  - Caste system: Unique to Indian society based on birth

## Social Processes (86:01)

### Definition and Examples
- **Process**: Simply indicates something is happening or going on
- **Social Processes**: Various ongoing changes in society

### Major Social Processes
- Urbanization: Shift of population from rural to urban areas
- Family nuclearization: Joint families breaking up, replaced by nuclear families  
- Globalization: World becoming more interconnected across national boundaries
- Westernization
- Women empowerment
- Secularization

### Evolution vs Social Change
- **Evolution**: Not any or every change - specific kind of change from simple, homogeneous, undifferentiated entities to more complex, large scale, more differentiated entities
- **Social Evolution**: Particular view of social change following this pattern

## AUGUSTE COMTE's View of Sociology (90:00)

### Social Statics and Social Dynamics
- **According to AUGUSTE COMTE**: Sociology is the study of social statics and social dynamics

#### Social Statics
- **Definition**: Study of how society remains as it is over a period of time
- **Examples of continuity**:
  - Caste endogamy: Brahmans marrying Brahmans, Bunniyas marrying Bunniyas (continuing for 2000+ years)
  - Social inequality: Always present in some form across time periods
  - Patriarchy: Male dominance continuing across generations

#### How Society Ensures Continuity

1. **Socialization**: Next generation is taught the ways of living by the previous generation
   - Through family, education system, religion, mass media, peer groups
   - Children observe and learn from parents' behavior patterns
   - Example: Gender roles perpetuated through media portrayal

2. **Social Control**: Society compels individuals to fall in line when social norms are not adhered to
   - **Legal mechanisms**: Laws criminalizing certain behaviors (example: earlier criminalization of homosexuality under Section 377)
   - **Social mechanisms**: Social boycott, physical harm, moral policing, ridicule, mocking
   - Example: Social criticism of house husbands who don't conform to traditional gender roles

#### Social Dynamics
- **Recognition**: No society ever remains completely unchanging
- **Example**: While patriarchy continues, the nature of male dominance and female dependence has undergone significant changes
  - Grandmother's generation: Purdah system, serving husband while standing, eating leftovers
  - Mother's generation: Separate thali for meals
  - Current generation: Women eating before men, wearing western clothing

## Nature of the Discipline of Sociology (128:05)

### Basic Definitions

| Sociologist | Definition |
|---|---|
| AUGUSTE COMTE | Sociology is the science of social phenomena |
| DURKHEIM | Sociology is the science of social institutions |
| OGBURN and NIMKOFF | Sociology is the scientific study of social life |

### Key Characteristics of Sociology

#### 1. Focus on Human Societies
- **Primary focus**: Human relationships, human groupings, human behavior, human social institutions
- **Not focused on**: Animal societies (though some social organization exists among other species)
- **Exception**: Environmental sociology (since 1960s-70s) studies human interaction with other species
  - Man-animal conflict
  - Human relationships with pets
  - Cultural worship of animals (cow in Hinduism)

#### 2. Focus on Groups Rather Than Individuals
- **Macrosociology**: Focus on aggregates, groups, communities, classes rather than specific individuals
- **Development**: WEBER onwards, discipline also started focusing on individual behavior (microsociology)
- **Contrast**: Psychology focuses more on individual chemical processes, neural connections

#### 3. Largely Descriptive, Not Prescriptive
- **Primary approach**: Describes how society is, what is happening in society, why it is happening
- **Does not prescribe**: What should be done or how society should be
- **Who prescribes**: Reformers, visionaries, statesmen, political leadership; among disciplines - philosophy

**Alternative Approach**: Small but growing section suggests active engagement in social reconstruction
- **Examples**: 
  - Feminist sociology: Describing unequal gender relations and prescribing solutions for gender equality
  - Dalit sociologists: Highlighting caste inequalities and suggesting policy prescriptions for egalitarian society

#### 4. Scientific Discipline
- **Founding fathers' view**: COMTE, SPENCER, DURKHEIM, SAINT-SIMON established sociology as scientific discipline using scientific method
- **Scientific method implications**:
  - Based on facts, empirical data, evidence
  - Following systematic methodology
  - Experimentation, classification, objective processing of data
  - Arriving at generalizations and laws governing social life

**Challenge to Scientific Approach**: WEBER onwards, strong argument emerged against sociology being purely scientific
- **Result**: Non-scientific methods started being used in sociological research
- **Current status**: Diversity of methods including both scientific and non-scientific approaches

#### 5. Focus on Patterns and Generalizations
- **Primary focus**: Identifying patterns and framing generalizations, not on unique events
- **Contrast**: History focuses on unique events (Third Battle of Panipat, specific battles, etc.)

**Examples of Sociological Generalizations**:
- **MARX**: Stages of society - primitive communism → ancient slave society → feudal society → industrial capitalism → communist society
- **COMTE**: Theological stage → metaphysical stage → scientific stage  
- **LEWIS HENRY MORGAN**: Savagery → barbarism → civilization

**Development**: WEBER onwards, also started focusing on unique events (not just laws and patterns)

#### 6. Study of Interconnected Social Institutions
- **Approach**: Social institutions are not studied in isolation but as interconnected with other social institutions
- **Examples of interconnections**:
  - **Family and Religion**: Family norms set by religion, marriage ceremonies, dietary restrictions (Agarwal families not eating non-vegetarian food)
  - **Religion and Politics**: Right-wing political parties banking on religious communities as vote banks
  - **Politics and Family**: Liberal vs conservative political thinking affecting relationships with children and spouse
  - **Economy and Family**: Family's economic status determining money spent on children's education
