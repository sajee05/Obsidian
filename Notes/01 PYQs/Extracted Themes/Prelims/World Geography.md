5. Specific Geographical Features/Locations: Lake Faguibine (Mali) (2022), Levant (Eastern Mediterranean) (2022), Congo Basin (Cameroon) (2023), Abyssinian Plateau (Ethiopia) (2013), Atlas Mountains (NW Africa) (2013), Guiana Highlands (NE South America) (2013), Okavango Basin (Botswana) (2013), Turkey (Location) (2014), SE Asia Cities (Sequence) (2014).
6. Longest Borders: Canada-USA (2024).

#### Options Analysis:

1. **Matching (Multiple Pairs):** Dominant format testing knowledge of region/country/reason pairings (Q24 2024, Q5 2023, Q6 2023, Q11 2022, Q10 2018, Q11 2018, Q9 2019, Q12 2014, Q16 2013). Requires identifying the number of _correctly_ matched pairs, demanding accuracy across multiple items.
2. **Identification (Single Correct):** Identifying specific locations (Q3 2023 - Congo Basin), members (Q14 2014 - Arctic Council), descriptions (Q17 2022 - Levant), reasons (Q7 2023 - Coups), disputes (Q15 2022 - Senkaku), or features (Q22 2024 - Longest border).
3. **Statement Analysis:** Used for evaluating understanding of specific agreements/organizations (Q15 2015 - IOR-ARC), geographical processes (Q1 2011 - Kra Canal impact), or regional characteristics (Q1 2023 - Red Sea).
4. **Geographical Sequencing:** Q15 (2014) tests spatial awareness by asking for the correct north-south sequence of cities.
5. **Distractors:** Matching questions heavily rely on incorrect pairings of places with countries, reasons, or geographical features. Questions about bordering countries often include near-misses or geographically close but non-bordering nations. Statements about organizations might misrepresent their purpose or establishment context (Q15 2015).
