## 12\. Era of Militant Nationalism (1905-1909)

### Growth of Militant Nationalism

#### Militant Nationalism

- Emerged 1890s, solidified by 1905 with revolutionary wing
- Catalysts: British intransigence, economic exploitation, repressive legislation
- Government taking rights away instead of granting more
	- ==1892==: Indian Councils Act criticized for failing to satisfy nationalists
	- ==1897==: Natu brothers deported without trial, Tilak imprisoned
	- ==1898==: Repressive laws under IPC Section 124A, 156A amplified
	- ==1899==: Indian members in Calcutta Corporation reduced
	- ==1904==
		- Official Secrets Act curbed press freedom
		- Indian Universities Act increased government control over universities
- ==Famines== (1896-1900) killed 90 lakh people, exposed colonial exploitation

Indian Famines between 1896 and 1900

- 1896-1897 Famine: Failed monsoons → drought → 1-3M deaths across Central India, inadequate relief due to laissez-faire policies
- 1899-1900 Bombay Famine: Monsoon failure → 1-4.5M deaths, ineffective relief worsened by taxation, grain exports

Indian Universities Act (1904)

- Counter nationalist infiltration into national universities

Official Secrets Act (1923)

- Suppress any activity deemed in opposition to British interest
- Effectively criminalise espionage
- Used to curb press and political dissent

Section 124A

- Deals with the offense of sedition

#### Ideological Foundations

- Self-reliance philosophy from Tilak, Aurobindo, Pal
- Education spread awareness while creating educated unemployed class which drew attention to poverty and underdeveloped state of the country's economy
- International examples
	- Japan's rise (==1868==: Meiji Restoration, ==1905:== Victory over Russia)
	- European military defeats (==1896==: Ethiopians over Italian Army, ==1899== - ==1902==: Boers Wars)
- Reaction against westernisation led by Indian intellectuals
- Dissatisfaction with moderate "Three P's" approach → Prayer, Petition, Protest

#### Militant School

- Leaders (Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghosh) across regions united in approach
- Core principles
	- Self-reliance
	- Swaraj
	- Direct action
	- Mass participation
- Curzon's policies (especially Bengal partition) confirmed British hostility
- New leadership channeled mass potential against colonial rule

### Swadeshi and Boycott Movement

- Dec ==1903:== Originated from anti-partition movement against British decision to divide Bengal (July ==1905==: Actual Division)
- Western Bengal (Hindu majority) → Calcutta capital
- Eastern Bengal (Muslim majority) → Dacca capital
- ==British motive==: Weaken Bengali nationalism by dividing population by language and religion
- Curzon promoted Dacca to appease Muslims, continuing divide-and-rule policy

#### Movement Development (1903-1905)

- Moderate leaders (Banerjea, Mitra, Ray) used petitions, meetings, newspapers for protest
- August ==1905==: ==Boycott Resolution== passed at Calcutta Townhall, Formation Proclamation of ==Swadeshi Movement== made, Boycott of Manchester cloth + Liverpool salt
- October ==1905==
	- Partition implemented; public observed mourning, sang Bande Mataram + Amar Sonar Bangla

	- Delhi (Syed Haider Raza)
	- Madras (Chidambaram Pillai)

#### Congress Response

- ==1905==: Congress under Gokhale supported anti-partition and Swadeshi Movement
- Militants (Tilak, Rai, Pal, Ghosh) advocated nationwide mass struggle for swaraj
- ==1906==: Congress under Naoroji declared self-government / swaraj goal (like colonies of Australia and Canada)
- ==1907==: Moderates-Extremists split at Surat session over movement tactics

### Movement under Extremist Leadership

- Extremists dominated Swadeshi Movement after Moderate failure
- Government suppression: student atrocities, banned Vande Mataram, restricted meetings

#### Extremist Programme (1906)

- Naoroji declared self-government as goal
- Passive resistance beyond swadeshi → boycott government institutions
- Purpose: paralyse British administration through organized refusal
- Aurobindo: "Political freedom is the life breath of a nation"

#### Struggle Methods

#### Swadeshi National Education Movement

- British suppression triggered boycott of colonial educational institutions
- Raja Subodh Mullick donated ₹100,000 for national schools
- ==1906==: National Council of Education established ==Bengal National College== and ==Bengal Technical Institute==
- Bengal National College
	- Principal: Aurobindo Ghosh
	- President: Rashbehari Ghosh
- Education delivered through vernacular medium

#### Swadeshi Enterprises

#### Cultural Renaissance

- Tagore's ==Amar Sonar Bangla== (later Bangladesh national anthem) Subramania Bharati's ==Sudesha Geetham== inspired nationalist movement

#### Mass Participation

### Annulment of Partition

- ==1911==: Bengal partition annulled, capital shifted to Delhi
- Bihar and Orissa separated from Bengal, Assam made separate province

### Evaluation of Swadeshi Movement

#### Movement fizzles out

- ==1908==: Movement fizzled out
- Decline factors
	- Government repression
	- Organisational failure
	- Leadership arrests / Deportation; Aurobindo Ghosh + Bipin Chandra Pal retired from active politics
	- Internal conflicts; Surat Split etc
	- Limited class reach
	- Theoretical resistance

#### Movement a Turning Point

#### Moderates vs Exremists

| Dimension | Moderates | Extremists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Social base | Zamindars and upper middle classes in towns | Educated middle and lower middle classes in towns |
| Ideological inspiration | Western liberal thought and European history | Indian history, cultural heritage, and Hindu traditional symbols |
| View of British mission | Believed in England's providential mission in India | Rejected 'providential mission theory' as an illusion |
| Political relations with Britain | Believed political connections with Britain to be in India's social, political, and cultural interests | Believed that political connections with Britain would perpetuate British exploitation of India |
| Loyalty to British Crown | Professed loyalty to the British Crown | Believed that the British Crown was unworthy of claiming Indian loyalty |
| Mass participation | Believed that the movement should be limited to middle-class intelligentsia; masses not yet ready for participation in political work | Had immense faith in the capacity of masses to participate and to make sacrifices |
| Political demands | Demanded constitutional reforms and share for Indians in services | Demanded swaraj as the panacea for Indian ills |
| Methods of struggle | Insisted on the use of constitutional methods only | Did not hesitate to use extra-constitutional methods like boycott and passive resistance to achieve their objectives |
| Patriotism | They were patriots and did not play the role of a comprador class | They were patriots who made sacrifices for the sake of the country |

### Surat Split 1907

- The Surat Split (1907)
	- Congress divided during revolutionary momentum period
	- Stemmed from ideological differences between Moderates and Extremists
- Ideological Divide (1905-1907)
	- Extremists: Expanded boycott beyond Bengal, aggressive resistance, Tilak/Lajpat Rai leadership
	- Moderates: Constitutional methods, limited boycott, council reforms participation
	- ==1906== Calcutta compromise: ==Naoroji presidency==, ==swarajya== goal established (Swaraj mentioned first time)

#### Split Takes Place

- Extremists wanted Nagpur session with Tilak as president
- Moderates moved meeting to Surat, proposed Rashbehari Ghosh as President, dropped key resolutions
- Both sides adopted rigid positions making compromise impossible
- Moderates retained control of Congress organization

#### Government Response

### The Government Strategy

- Hostile to Congress despite Moderates distancing from militants
- Implemented ==carrot and stick== policy after Swadeshi Movement
- ==Three-pronged approach==: repression-conciliation-suppression
	- First stage: Extremists repressed to frighten Moderates
	- Second stage: Moderates placated through concessions
	- Strategy aimed to isolate Extremists while bringing Moderates to government side

### Morley-Minto Reforms (1909)

- 1906
	- Simla Deputation demanded Muslim separate electorates
	- Gopal Krishna Gokhale presented Congres demands

#### Morley Minto Reforms

- Viceroy Minto and Morley created reforms to placate Moderates and Muslims
- Indian Councils Act 1909 (Morley Minto Reforms) established:
	- Representation Structure
		- ==Separate electorates for Muslims== with excess representation (first time)
		- Imperial Legislative Council: 69 members (37 officials, 32 non-officials)
		- Provincial councils given non-official majority (though non-elected majority remained)
		- One ==Indian appointed to Viceroy's executive council== (Satyendra Sinha, ==1909==)
	- Electoral System
		- ==Indirect elections== (Local bodies $→elect$ Electoral College $→elect$ Provincial Legislature members $→elect$ Central Legislature members)
		- Muslim voters given lower income qualification than Hindus
		- Reserved seats: 8 for Muslims, 4 for British capitalists, 2 for landlords, 13 general
	- Powers and Limitations
		- Legislative powers expanded at central and provincial levels
		- Could pass resolutions, ==ask questions==, ==vote on budget items==
		- Budget as whole could not be voted upon
		- No parliamentary responsibility despite parliamentary forms

#### Critical Evaluation

- Political Intent
	- Aimed to ==divide nationalists== through separate electorates
	- Strategy to rally Moderates and Muslims against rising nationalism
	- Morley explicitly rejected self-government and parliamentary system
- Structural Flaws
	- Introduced parliamentary forms without responsibility
	- Election system too indirect (infiltration through sieves)
	- Created political barriers between communities
- Contemporary Views
	- Morley: "If reforms led to parliamentary system, I would have nothing to do with it"
	- Nehru: Reforms reversed unification process, corrupted political structure
	- Montford Report: "Reforms afforded no answer to Indian problems"
	- System characterized as benevolent despotism rather than true representation

## 13\. First Phase of Revolutionary Activities (1907 - 1917)

### Why the Surge of Revolutionary Activities

- Revolutionary heroism: byproduct of militant nationalism
- Two phases
	1. Swadeshi/Boycott Movement (until 1917)
	2. After fallout of Non-Cooperation Movement
- Youth continued revolutionary activities after leadership failure

### Revolutionary Programme

- Adopted individual heroic actions following Russian/Irish models
- Methods: assassinations, revolutionary training, fundraising dacoities, military conspiracies
- Goals: terrorize rulers, remove authority fear, inspire patriotic youth
- Extremist leaders failed to counter individualistic violent approach
- Did not distinguish between mass revolution and individual violent acts

### A Survey of Revolutionary Activities

#### Bengal

- ==1870== s: Inactive secret societies
- ==1902==: First revolutionary groups formed in Midnapore (Jnanendranath Basu) and Calcutta (==Anushilan Samiti== by Promotha Mitter)
- ==1906==: Yugantar weekly advocated violence after police brutalities (Force must be stopped by force) [#Ind\_Publications](https://upsckata.com/1.1+History/Modern+History/Spectrum+Summary/#Ind_Publications)
- ==1907==
	- Yugantar group attempted to assassinate Lt. Governor Sir Andrew Fuller
	- Attempts to derail Lt. Governor Fraser's train
- ==Alipore Conspiracy Case==
	- ==1908==: Kingsford bombing killed unintended British women
	- British linked bomb to Anushilan members
	- Alipore conspiracy case prosecuted Anushilan members
	- Aurobindo Ghosh acquitted
	- Barindra Ghosh (Head of secret society of revolutionaries) + Ullaskar Dutt (maker of bombs) → given death penalty → later commuted
- ==1908==: Dacca Anushilan conducted ==Barrah dacoity== for revolutionary funds
- ==1909== - ==1910==: Assassinations of public prosecutor and deputy superintendent
- ==Delhi Conspiracy Trial==
	- ==1912==: Rashbehari Bose and Sachin Sanyal attempted to bomb Viceroy Hardinge
	- Baswant Kumar Biswas, Amir Chand, Avadh Behari → executed, Rashbehari Bose → escaped to Japan (==1915==), later formed INA
- ==German Plot / Zimmerman Plan==
	- WWI: Revolutionaries planned all-India insurrection with German arms
	- Bagha Jatin led Bengal, Rashbehari Bose assigned Upper India
	- Funded through dacoities, aimed for Fort William seizure and military mutiny
	- Plot leaked to police, revolutionaries intercepted at Balasore
	- September ==1915==: Bagha Jatin killed in gunfight, conspiracy collapsed
- Revolutionary newspapers: Sandhya, Yugantar (Bengal), Kal (Maharashtra) [#Ind\_Publications](https://upsckata.com/1.1+History/Modern+History/Spectrum+Summary/#Ind_Publications)
- Legacy: Most substantial outcome of swadeshi Bengal, influenced educated youth
- Limitations: Hindu religious emphasis alienated Muslims, narrow upper-caste base, quixotic heroism (pursuit of noble but impractical or unrealistic ideals)

#### Punjab

- Extremism driven by famines, high taxes, forced labor (begar)
- Lala Lajpat Rai published self-help focused Punjabee [#Ind\_Publications](https://upsckata.com/1.1+History/Modern+History/Spectrum+Summary/#Ind_Publications)
- Ajit Singh formed ==Anjuman-e-Mohisban-i-Watan==, published Bharat Mata [#Ind\_Publications](https://upsckata.com/1.1+History/Modern+History/Spectrum+Summary/#Ind_Publications)

- ==1907==: Government banned political meetings, deported Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh → Punjab Extremism died down

#### Maharashtra

#### Revolutionary Activities Abroad

Dhingra’s statement in court before his verdict was pronounced; he was hanged at the age of just 26.

- Revolutionary centers emerged in Paris, Geneva (Bhikaji Cama), Berlin (Virendranath Chattopadhyaya)

##### Ghadr Party

- Precursor: Swadesh Sevak Home at Vancouver, United India House at Seattle
- ==1913==: Ghadr Party formed in San Francisco with ex-Punjab soldiers/peasants who migrated to North America
- Ghadr program: assassinate officials, publish revolutionary literature, organize revolts in British colonies
- ==1914==: ==Komagata Maru incident== (370 immigrants denied entry to Canada) inflamed Punjab situation
- ==1915==
	- February: Planned armed revolt in Punjab garrisons foiled; 45 revolutionaries hanged
	- March: Defense of India Act (allowed British to detain without trial, censor press) passed to crush Ghadr movement

###### Evaluation of Ghadr

- Achievement: preached militant nationalism with secular approach
- Failure: lacked organized leadership, underestimated preparation required
- Lala Hardayal was unsuited as organizer

##### Revolutionaries in Europe

- ==1915==: Berlin Committee for Indian Independence established by Virendranath Chattopadhyay, Bhupendranath Dutta, Lala Hardayal
- Supported by German foreign office under "Zimmerman Plan"
- Aimed to mobilize Indian settlers abroad, send volunteers/arms to India

- Mission to Kabul: organized "provisional Indian government" with crown prince

##### Mutiny in Singapore

- February 15, ==1915==: Singapore Mutiny by Punjabi Muslim and Sikh battalions; 37 executed

### Decline

- Defence of India Rules prisoners released
- Atmosphere of conciliation after Montagu's August 1917 statement
- Talk of constitutional reforms and Gandhi's entry with non-violence program

## 14\. First World War and Nationalist Response

### Home Rule League Movement

- More effective response than revolutionary activities
- Leaders (Tilak, Besant, Khaparde, Iyer, Baptista, Jinnah) formed alliance for continuous action unlike Congress (which only had annual sessions)
- Goal: Self-government within British commonwealth, modeled after Irish Home Rule
- Two separate leagues (Tilak, Besant) launched aggressive political approach

#### Causative Factors

#### The Leagues

- ==1914==: Tilak and Besant revived political activity independently after ==1914== Congress session failure to reach Moderate Extremist reconciliation
- 1915: Besant campaigned for self-government through newspapers (New India, Commonweal [#Ind\_Publications](https://upsckata.com/1.1+History/Modern+History/Spectrum+Summary/#Ind_Publications) ) and meetings
- Separate leagues established b/w Tilak and Besant to avoid friction, coordinated by confining work to specific areas

|  | Tilak's League | Besant's League |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Establishment | April 1916 | September 1916 |
| Headquarters | Poona (with first meeting at Belgaum) | Madras |
| Coverage Area | Maharashtra (excluding Bombay city), Karnataka, Central Provinces, and Berar | Rest of India (including Bombay city) |
| Structure | Six branches, more structured organization | 200 branches, loosely organized |
| Key Demands/Personnel | • Swarajya   • Formation of linguistic states   • Education in the vernacular | • George Arundale (organizing secretary)   • B.W. Wadia and C.P. Ramaswamy Aiyar (key workers) |

#### Home Rule Programme

#### Government Response

- Imposed severe repression, especially in Madras where students prohibited from attending political meetings
- ==1917==
	- June: Besant arrested, triggering nationwide protest
	- September: Besant released

#### Movement Decline by 1919

- Organisational weakness, communal riots (1917-18)
- Montagu's 1917 reform statement pacified Moderates
- Montagu-Chelmsford reforms (July 1918) divided nationalists
- September 1918: Tilak abroad for libel case
- Gandhi's approach gained momentum
- ==1920==: Gandhi renamed league to Swarajya Sabha, by 1921 league joined INC

#### Home Rule Movement Impact

- Transitioned Congress from deliberative to mass involvement
- Connected towns and countryside, created nationalists
- Prepared masses for Gandhian politics
- Influenced 1917 Montagu-Montford reforms through Tilak and Besant's efforts

### 1916 Lucknow Session

#### Readmission of extremists to congress

- Reunited Moderates and Extremists in Congress
- Readmitted Tilak's faction after he declared support for reform, denounced support for overthrow of govt, acts of violence
- Pherozeshah Mehta died → Led the moderate opposition to extremism

#### 1916 Lucknow Pact

- Younger militant nationalists in League aligned with Congress on anti-imperialism
- League shifted due to
	- Turkey abandonment by Britain
	- 1911: Bengal partition annulment
	- Refusal of British to set up university at Aligarh
	- WWI repression
- Key Provisions of the Pact
	- Congress accepted separate electorates until joint electorates demanded

- Made self-government demands ==non-seditious==
- Introduced concept of "dyarchy"

#### Indian Objections

- No specific timeframe given
- British would decide nature and timing of advances toward responsible government

## 15\. Emergence of Gandhi

- Post-WWI nationalist resurgence in India and colonies
- Gandhi emerged as leader of broad-based struggle against imperialism

### Why Nationalist Resurgence Now

- Post-War Economic Crisis: Indian war contributions unacknowledged, taxation funded war, thousands died
- Sectoral Suffering: Industries faced recession, workers unemployed, peasants overtaxed, returning soldiers disillusioned
- Political Expectations: Cooperation during war created expectations of British concessions
- Global Disillusionment: Paris Peace Conference revealed continued imperial ambitions → Instead of granting self determination Britain and France divided the colonies of defeated powers (Germany and Ottoman Empire) among themselves
- Russian Revolution Impact: Bolsheviks renounced imperial rights, demonstrated people's power

### Impact of Russian Revolution (Nov 917)

- Bolshevik Party overthrew Czarist regime, established Soviet Union under Lenin
- Soviet Union renounced Czarist imperialist rights in Asia
- Granted self-determination to former colonies, equal status to Asian nationalities
- October Revolution demonstrated people's power against tyranny through organization and unity z

### Consequences

- Business: Supported boycott for swadeshi benefits; big business feared labor unrest
- Peasants: Massive participation despite Congress stance; expressed anti-British / anti Indian (masters and oppressors) sentiments
- Students: Thousands left government schools for national institutions
- Women: Gave up Purdah, donated valuables for Tilak Fund, joined picketing foreign goods
- Hindu-Muslim Unity: Two-thirds of arrestees Muslim; unprecedented communal cooperation

#### Government Response & Movement End

- May ==1921==: Gandhi-Reading talks failed over Ali brothers' speeches (Gandhi refused to ask them to remove portion from speeches that suggested violence)
- December: Crackdown on protesters, leaders arrested
- ==1922==
	- Gandhi threatened civil disobedience if political prisoner not released + press control not removed
	- February: Chauri Chaura violence (22 policemen killed) → Gandhi withdrew movement
	- Leaders (Bose, CR Das, Nehru) criticized withdrawal as premature
	- March: Gandhi sentenced to six years imprisonment

### Why Gandhi Withdrew the Movement

- People misunderstood non-violence principles
- Chauri-Chaura incident risked movement turning violent
- Colonial regime could easily suppress violent movement and justify armed response
- Movement showed fatigue; government unwilling to negotiate
- November ==1922==: Khilafat cause dissolved when Turkey became secular under Mustafa Kamal
- ==1924==: Caliphate abolished completely

### Movement Impact Assessment

### Swarajists and No Changers

#### Genesis of Congress Khilafat Swarajya Party

- ==1922==
	- Post-Gandhi's arrest, nationalists divided on movement strategy
	- ==Swarajists== (CR Das, Nehru, Khan) advocated council entry to expose weaknesses, create political arena
	- ==No-Changers== (C Rajagopalachari, Patel, Rajendra Prasad, MA Ansari) favoured boycott continuation, constructive work
	- Swarajists' proposal defeated at Gaya Congress session
	- C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru resigned from Congress leadership
	- Formed ==Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party== with Das as president

#### Key Arguments

- Swarajists: Council entry creates new front, prevents government manipulation, maintains momentum
- No-Changers: Parliamentary work diverts from constructive programs, diminishes revolutionary spirit

#### Agree to Disagree

- ==1923==: Compromise allowed Swarajists to contest elections as Congress group to avoid 1907 Surat type split

#### Swarajist Manifesto (October 1923)

- ==1923==:
	- ==October==: Swarajists released manifesto
		- Criticized British selfish interests in governing India
		- Denounced reforms as exploitation tools under responsible government pretense
		- Promised to present self-government demand in councils
		- If demand ejected, would adopt uniform obstruction policy to make governance impossible
	- ==November==:
		- Swarajists won 42/141 seats, secured Central Provinces majority

#### Gandhi's attitude

- Initially opposed council entry
- ==1924==
	- Feb: Released from prison, gradually reconciled with Swarajists
	- Felt public opposition to council entry would be counterproductive
	- Government crackdown on revolutionaries and Swarajists angered Gandhi
	- Both sides agreed at Belgaum session that Swarajists would work in councils as part of Congress

#### Swarajist Activity in Councils

- Weakened by communal riots, split into ==Responsivists== (pro-government) and ==Non - Responsivists==
- Responsivists (Lala Lajpat Rai, Madan Mohan Malaviya, N.C. Kelkar) advocated government cooperation, office-holding, protecting Hindu interests
- ==1925==
	- Government divided Swarajists by separating militants/moderates, Hindus/Muslims
	- Swarajists lost Muslim support over Bengal tenant issues
- ==1926==
	- Leadership advocated civil disobedience, withdrew from legislatures
	- 1926 Elections: Swarajists performed poorly, won 40 seats in Central Legislative Assembly
- ==1930==
	- Swarajists walked out following Lahore Congress resolution on Purna Swaraj, beginning Civil Disobedience Movement

##### Achievements

- Opposed government on budgets
- Advocated self-government
- ==1925==: Elected Vitthalbhai Patel as speaker
- ==1928==: Defeated Public Safety Bill (would give govt power to deport undesirable foreigners)
- Exposed Montford scheme limitations
- Demonstrated councils could be used effectively

##### Drawbacks

- Failed to coordinate legislature/mass struggles
- Relied on newspapers reporting to communicate with public
- Limited coalition-building
- Embraced power privileges
- Neglected peasant causes in Bengal → lost support of Muslims

#### Constructive Work by No Changers

- Established ashrams among tribes/lower castes, promoted khadi / charkha
- Created national schools
- Worked for Hindu-Muslim unity, untouchability removal, foreign goods boycott
- Led civil disobedience organising

##### Critique of constructive work

- ==1920== s: Watershed decade—masses joined national movement, political currents crystallised (i.e political ideas became more structured and well defined)

#### Mass Movements

- Youth: Student leagues nationwide
- ==1928==: Nehru led ==Bengal Students' Conference==
- Peasants: Agitations for tenancy reforms across provinces
