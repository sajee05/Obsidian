## 7\. The Revolt of 1857

- Major uprising against British colonial rule established after 1757 Battle of Plassey
- Affected all sections of society, preceded by sporadic rebellions across India

### Simmering Discontent

- Economic causes
	- Destroyed traditional economy fabric
	- Peasantry: Heavy taxation → Borrowing from moneylenders at high rates → Non payment = Eviction
	- Artisans → Lost patronage from native rulers + Handicrafts deliberately crippled through tariff policies
	- 21,000 Awadh taluqdars: Lost estates, later became central revolt centre
- Political causes
	- Aggressive annexation policy, broken pledges
	- Policies like ==Effective Control==, ==Subsidiary Alliance==, ==Doctrine of Lapse== caused suspicion
		- Succession rights denied to Hindu princes
	- Mughal authority diminished after ==1856==
- Administrative causes
	- Rampant corruption → police, petty officials, lower court
	- Alien governance system, absence of sovereignty
- Socio-religious causes
	- British racial superiority, missionary activities
	- Interference in social practices, religious customs → sati abolition, widow-marriage, women's education
	- Temple taxation
	- ==Religious Disabilities Act 1856==
		- Preserved inheritance rights of converts from Hinduism
		- Perceived as promoting Christian conversion
- External factors: British defeats in Afghan, Punjab, Crimean Wars revealed vulnerability
- Sepoy grievances
	- Service conditions conflicted with religious beliefs
	- Restrictions on caste marks, rumours of proselytising
	- ==1856==: ==General Service Enlistment Act== required service anywhere
	- Denial of foreign service allowance when serving in Sindh/Punjab
	- Annexation of Awadh, home to many sepoys, inflamed feelings
	- Sepoys experienced discrimination in promotion and privileges
	- Previous revolts in Bengal (==1764==), Vellore (==1806==), Barrackpore (==1825==)

### Beginning and Spread of the Revolt

#### The Spark

- Bone dust in flour rumours
- Greased cartridges (beef/pig fat) violated Hindu/Muslim religious taboos

#### Starts at Meerut

- Timeline: Began Meerut (May 10), spread Punjab to Narmada, Bihar to Rajputana
- Early Signs: 19th Infantry refused Enfield rifles (Feb), Mangal Pande executed (Apr 8)
- Catalyst: 85 cavalry soldiers imprisoned (May 9), freed by comrades (May 10)
- Marched to Delhi

#### Choice of Bhadur Shah as Symbolic Head

- Aged Bahadur Shah Zafar proclaimed Emperor of India
- Delhi became revolt center, last Mughal king as leader symbolized India's unity
- Bahadur Shah wrote to chiefs/rulers urging confederation against British
- Revolt spread to Awadh, Rohilkhand, Doab, Bundelkhand, Bihar, East Punjab

#### Civilians Join

- Peasants, artisans, labourers attacked moneylenders, destroying account books, courts, revenue offices
- Attacked British law courts, revenue offices, police stations
- Scale: 1.5 million deaths (1 million civilians) in Awadh alone

#### Storm Centres and Leaders of Revolt

- Delhi
	- Bahadur Shah → symbolic figurehead
	- General Bakht Khan → actual commander, led Bareilly revolt
- Kanpur
	- Nana Saheb: Adopted son of last peshwa, banished from Pune
	- Expelled British from Kanpur (June 27), proclaimed himself Peshwa
- Lucknow
	- Begum Hazrat Mahal established administration with son Birjis Qadir as nawab
	- March 1858: Lucknow recovered by British
- Bareilly
	- Khan Bahadur organized 40,000 troops against British

- Grassroots Leadership
	- Shah Mal
		- Organized 84 villages → ==Chaurasi Desh==
		- Attacked infrastructure
		- Established justice system
		- Killed July 1857

#### Suppression of 1857 Revolt

- ==1857==: British captured Delhi (September 20), Bahadur Shah exiled to Rangoon (died 1862)
- Royal princes executed by Lieutenant Hudson, Mughal dynasty extinguished
- ==1857== - ==1859== → Major leaders eliminated
	- Rani of Jhansi → died in battle
	- Tantia Tope →executed
	- Kunwar Singh, Bakht Khan, Maulvi Ahmadullah → dead
	- Nana Saheb → disappeared in Nepal
	- Begum of Awadh → hid in Nepal
- British authority fully restored by 1859 through massive military resources

#### Reasons for Failure

- Limited geographical spread: Only 25% of India's area/population affected
- Fragmented support: Big zamindars, educated Indians, merchants opposed revolt
- Most Indian rulers remained neutral or pro-British (Scindia, Holkar, Patiala, Kashmir)
- Military disadvantages: Poor weapons, no coordination among rebel leaders
- British superiority: Modern weapons, telegraph communication, exceptional generals
- Ideological weakness: No unified vision, coherent program, or central leadership

### Hindu-Muslim Unity Factor

- Complete Hindu-Muslim cooperation across all levels (people, soldiers, leaders)
- Hindu sepoys marched to Delhi, acknowledged Muslim emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar
- Mutual respect for religious sentiments (cow slaughter banned in rebel-controlled areas)
- Integrated leadership structure (Nana Saheb-Azimullah, Laxmibai-Afghan soldiers)
- Evidence that Indian politics were not inherently communal/sectarian before 1858

### Nature of the Revolt

- British view: Mere "Sepoy Mutiny" (Seeley)
- Nationalist view: "First War of Independence" (Savarkar)
- Marxist view: "Soldier-peasant democratic combine against imperialism"
- Nehru: "Last-ditch stand of feudalism against commercial capitalism"
- Modern consensus: Neither purely military mutiny nor national independence movement
- S.B. Chaudhuri: "First combined attempt of many classes to challenge foreign power"
- Significance: Despite failure, planted seeds of national consciousness

### Consequences of 1857 Revolt

- Administrative Transformation
	- ==1858==: Better Government of India Act transferred power from Company to Crown
	- Queen Victoria declared sovereign, Governor General became "Viceroy"

- Military Reorganization
	- ==Division and counterpoise== policy implemented
	- Indian soldiers reduced, European troops increased
	- Recruitment focused on ==martial races== (Punjab, Nepal, northwestern frontier)
	- Artillery and officer positions reserved for Europeans
	- ==Army Amalgamation Scheme== (==1861==) transferred European troops to Crown service
- Political Shifts
	- British governance became more autocratic, reform era ended
	- ==White Mutiny==: European soldiers protested transfer to Crown service
	- ==Indian Civil Service Act== (1861) promised equality but preserved British dominance
	- Systematic economic exploitation intensified
	- Racial divide widened, British press portrayed Indians as subhuman
	- ==Whiteman's burden== philosophy justified imperial control

### Long-term Impact

- Revealed Company's administrative weaknesses to British
- Exposed genuine grievances of people and sepoys
