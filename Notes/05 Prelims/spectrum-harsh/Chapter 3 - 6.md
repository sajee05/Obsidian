### Why English Succeeded

## 4\. India on the Eve of British Conquest

### Decline of Mughal Empire (18th century)

- Aurangzeb's reign (==1658== - ==1707==) marked beginning of Mughal decline
- Aurangzeb's misguided policies weakened state stability
- Post-Aurangzeb decline accelerated due to succession wars and weak rulers

#### Mughal Rulers after Aurangzeb

#### External Challenges to Mughals

- Weak borders allowed northwestern invasions
- ==Nadir Shah== (Persian) invaded ==1738== - ==1739==, ==defeated Mughals at Karnal==, looted Delhi
- ==Ahmad Shah Abdali== (Afghan) invaded multiple times (==1748== - ==1767==)
- ==Third Battle of Panipat== (==1761==): Abdali defeated Marathas

Strategic Importance of Panipat

- First Battle (==1526==): Babur vs Ibrahim Lodhi, established Mughal Empire
- Second Battle (==1556==): Akbar vs Hemu, continued Mughal rule
- Third Battle (==1761==): Marathas vs Ahmad Shah Abdali, ended Maratha ambitions of ruling over India
- Strategic location: Accessible battlefield near Delhi, flat ground suitable for warfare, enroute Grand Trunk Road, short monsoon, availability of artisans / smiths for warfare materials

#### Cause of Decline of Mughal Empire

##### Major Factors Contributing to Decline

- ==Shifting Allegiance of Zamindars==
	- Zamindars: hereditary landowners (rais, rajas, thakurs, khuts, desmukhs) with revenue collection role
	- Maintained soldiers, occupied important administrative position
	- During Aurangzeb's reign, power of zamindars increased significantly
	- Local zamindars helped nobility exploit empire weakness, carved independent kingdoms
- ==Jagirdari Crisis==
	- Nobility comprised jagirdars (assigned lands) and mansabdars (appointed administrators)
	- Divisiveness among nobility based on religion, homeland, tribe
	- Mutual rivalry, jealousy, power contests reduced empire prestige
- ==Rise of Regional Aspirations==
	- Aurangzeb's reign: rebellions by Jats, Sikhs, Marathas seeking own kingdoms
	- Their continuous struggle weakened empire considerably
	- Aurangzeb and Bahadur Shah I's attempts to suppress Rajputs backfired
	- Marathas expanded from Maharashtra to collecting sardeshmukhi and chauth throughout India
	- By ==1740==, Marathas controlled ==Gujarat, Malwa, Bundelkhand==
		- ![Area under Maratha](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/666ead5b926a231c838f693ada3fdc0a/Images/Area%20under%20Maratha.png)
			Figure: Area under Maratha

##### Scholarly Perspectives on Decline

- ==Satish Chandra==: Medieval economic stagnation, trade/industry decline, scientific underdevelopment, nobility's factional struggles
- ==Irfan Habib==: Economic and administrative causes, not religious reaction
- ==William Irvine==: Military inefficiency as principal cause
- ==Sidney Owen==: Aurangzeb's policies (reimposing jizya), alienating Hindu subjects
- ==J.N. Sarkar==: "Rottenness at core" - military/political helplessness, corrupt nobles

### Rise of Regional States

- Three categories of states emerged after Mughal Empire's decline
- ==Successor States==
	- Mughal provinces that broke away
	- Maintained Mughal ruler's sovereignty while establishing hereditary authority
	- Examples: Awadh, Bengal, Hyderabad
- ==Independent Kingdoms==
	- States formed through destabilisation of Mughal control
	- Examples: Mysore and Rajput states
- ==New States==
	- Established by rebels against Mughal empire
	- Examples: Maratha, Sikh, Jat states

#### Major Regional Powers

- ![Regional Kingdoms](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/666ead5b926a231c838f693ada3fdc0a/Images/Regional%20Kingdoms.jpeg)

	- Contenders for power multiplied
	- Foreign trade prospered while rest of economy stagnated

#### Slavery

- Economic distress drove people to sell offspring; domestic slavery common
- Indian slaves treated better than European counterparts; could marry; offsprings were free
- European arrival intensified slave trade to American/European markets

#### Cultural Developments

- Talented artists sought patronage at new state courts (Hyderabad, Lucknow, Jaipur, Murshidabad, Patna, Kashmir)

### Tribal Revolts

- Tribal Revolts: Most frequent and militant movements under British rule
- Mainland vs Northeast Tribal Revolts
	- Mainland: Sparked by land issues, British settlements disrupted joint ownership, forest restrictions, exploitation by outsiders
	- Northeast: Cross-border cultural links, sought autonomy/independence, not forest-based, revolts lasted longer, anti-Brahmin movements
- Common Characteristics
	- Ethnic solidarity, targeted moneylenders/traders not poor villagers
	- Common cause
		- Resentment against "foreign government" laws destroying traditional socio-economic framework
		- Erosion of tribal rights over land and forest
		- Land alienation as non-tribe people took over land, especially after roads and railways built
	- Many uprisings led by ==messiah-like figures== promising end to suffering
		- Tribal uprisings doomed from beginning due to outdated arms against modern weapons
