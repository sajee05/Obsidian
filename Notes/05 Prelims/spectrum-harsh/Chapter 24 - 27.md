## 24\. Post War National Scenario

### Two Strands of National Upsurge

- Negotiations between government, Congress, Muslim League → freedom and partition
- Militant mass actions by workers, peasants, states' peoples (INA-inspired strikes, RIN revolt, regional movements)

### Change in Government's Attitude

### Congress Election Campaign and INA Trials

- Winter ==1945== - ==1946==: Elections became platform for anti-British mobilization
- November ==1945==: Red Fort trials of INA officers → massive public backlash
- British error: trying Hindu-Muslim-Sikh defendants together, detaining 7,000 others
- Using Indian troops in Southeast Asia to restore French and Dutch colonial rule → heightened anti-colonial sentiment

#### Congress Support for INA Prisoners

- September ==1945==: Congress officially backed INA at Bombay session
- Elite leaders organized defense (Kailash Nath Katju → grandfather of Markandey Katju, Asaf Ali → First Indian Ambassador to US)
- INA Relief and Enquiry Committee provided practical support

#### The INA Agitation—A Landmark

- November 1945: INA week/day celebrations catalysed nationwide movement
- Movement crossed regional, class, religious boundaries → unprecedented unity
- Even government loyalists and military personnel showed sympathy
- Issue transformed from legal case to symbolic struggle over India's sovereignty
- Conflict reframed as "Indian versus British" → accelerated independence timeline

### Three Upsurges - Winter of 1945-46

> RIN Mutiny → Event marking the end of British Rule

#### Three-Stage Pattern

#### Impact Assessment

- Significance
	- Showed military potential, psychological liberation
	- Concessions by British
		- Limited INA trials (only accused of murder / brutal treatment of prisoners)
		- Sentence reductions
		- Troop withdrawals from Indo China / Indonesia
		- Cabinet Mission initiated
- Limitations
	- Brief, urban-centered, limited participation
	- Communal cooperation temporary
	- British repression capabilities remained intact → Maratha Battalion rounded up ratings / restored order

#### Congress Strategy

- Congress withheld official support fearing loss of control
- Gandhi viewed mutiny as poorly timed

### Election Results

- Congress: 91% non-Muslim votes, 57/102 Central Assembly seats, majority in most provinces except Bengal, Sindh, Punjab
- Muslim League: 86.6% Muslim votes, 30 Central Assembly seats, majority in Bengal and Sindh, established as dominant Muslim party
- Elections showed communal voting, extremely limited franchise (<10% provincial, <1% Central Assembly)

Majorities

- Singh, Bengal → Muslim League
- Punjab → Unionist - Congress - Akali coalition under Khizr Hayat Khan
- Other Provinces → Congress

### The Cabinet Mission

- February 1946: Attlee sent three-member mission for power transfer negotiations
	- Pethick Lawrence (chairman + Secretary of State)
	- Stafford Cripps
	- A.V. Alexander

#### Why British Withdrawal Seemed Imminent Now

- Nationalist forces successful, penetrated new areas post-war
- Nationalism spread in bureaucracy due to Indianisation policy, British-Indian ICS parity by 1939
- British conciliation-repression strategy failed
- Cripps' Offer insufficient: Only full freedom remained an offering
- Government exposed: Repressed even non violent resistance
- Congress constitutionalism boosted patriotic sentiment
- INA prisoner leniency demands from military raised reliability concerns
- Officials lacked numbers for mass movement repression
- British now aimed for settlement to ensure good Indo British post imperial relations

#### On the Eve of Cabinet Mission Plan

- Congress wanted central power transfer with minority accommodations
- British preferred united India as Commonwealth defense partner
- 1946
	- British policy shifted to united India preference
	- Attlee rejected minority veto over majority

#### Cabinet Mission (1946)

- 1946:
	- March: Arrived in Delhi
		- Discussion of
			- Interim government
			- Principles and procedures for framing a new constitution giving freedom to India
	- May:
		- Present plan after Congress-League deadlock on unity/partition

#### Main Points

##### Plan Rejected Pakistan

- High non-Muslim populations in proposed regions (38-48%)
- Would fragment Hindu/Sikh areas in Bengal and Punjab
- Would disrupt regional ties, create economic/administrative problems
- Would dangerously divide armed forces

##### Three-Section Structure

- Section A: Hindu-majority provinces
- Section B/C: Muslim-majority provinces
- Three-tier governance (provincial/sectional/union)
- 389-member Constituent Assembly: Elected by provinces through proportional representation
- Constitution
	- A,B,C sit separately $→decide constitution$ for groups and provinces if possible
	- A,B,C sit together $→decide constitution$ for union
- Federal structure with limited central powers (defence, communication, external affairs)
- Provinces with full autonomy, option to reconsider grouping after 10 years
- Princely states → No longer under British paramountcy, free to enter into arrangement with new govt / British govt

#### Interpretation Disputes

- Congress: Grouping optional, Single constituent assembly ⇒ Against creation of Pakistan
- Muslim League: Grouping compulsory ⇒ Pakistan

#### Main objections

- Congress
	- NWFP and Assam wrongly placed in sections B and C
	- Compulsory grouping violated provincial autonomy principle
	- Princely states lacked elected representatives in assembly
- League
	- Wanted mandatory grouping to establish B and C as Pakistan foundation
	- Anticipated Congress rejection would lead to League-formed interim government

#### Acceptance and Rejection

- 1946
	- 6 June: Muslim League accepted plan
	- 24 June: Congress accepted plan
	- July: Provincial assembly elections for Constituent Assembly
	- 10 July: Nehru declared Constituent Assembly sovereign, suggested NWFP and Assam could reject grouping
	- 29 July: League withdrew acceptance citing Nehru statement, called for "direct action" from August 16

Wavell's Breakdown Plan

- May 1946: Middle path between repression and complete withdrawal
- Proposed withdrawing British to Muslim provinces, giving rest to Congress
- Revealed British acknowledgment of inability to suppress Congress rebellion
- Showed some officials' intent to create Pakistan as "Northern Ireland" equivalent
- Plan ultimately superseded by Cabinet Mission Plan

### Communal Holocaust and the Interim Government

- 1946: August 16 riots caused thousands of deaths across Calcutta, Bombay, Noakhali, Bihar, Garhmukteshwar (UP)

#### Changed Government Priorities

- Wavell sought Congress inclusion in government despite League opposition
- British rule demanded one stance (encouraging communalism, denying legitimacy of nationalism), but withdrawal and post-imperial links required contrary posture

#### Interim Government

- ==1946==
	- 2 September: Congress-led government under Nehru formed
	- 26 October: League joined without giving up "direct action" despite rejecting Cabinet Mission's plans and compulsory grouping
	- 14 Ministers served from September 1946-August 1947, including Nehru, Patel, Liaquat Ali Khan
	- Key ministers: Nehru (Vice President of Exec Council, External Affairs), Patel (Home), Liaquat Ali Khan (Finance),

#### League's Obstructionist Approach

- ==1946==
	- Boycotted Constituent Assembly, forcing limited "Objectives Resolution" passage
	- Refused cabinet cooperation, questioned Congress decisions, restricted ministerial functions
	- Used government position solely to advance Pakistan agenda
- ==1947==
	- ==February crisis== erupted when Congress demanded League resignations
	- Crisis peaked with League demanding Constituent Assembly dissolution

### Birth and Spread of Communalism in India

- Emerged late 19th century alongside nationalism, threatening Indian unity

#### Characteristic Features

- Ideology prioritizing religious identity over society
- Three stages
	- Communal Nationalism
		- Community-based identity (religious, linguistic, ethnic) seeking unity, pride, or special rights
		- Eg - Religious groups during India's freedom struggle wanting own nation
	- Liberal Communalism
		- Communities seeking group rights while respecting other communities' freedoms
		- Example: Religious community requesting job/education reservations while accepting equal rights for others
	- Extreme Communalism
		- Religious groups have opposing interests
		- Groups cannot live together peacefully
		- One group's gain is another's loss

#### Nothing unique about Indian communalism

- Parallels global phenomena: fascism, anti-Semitism, sectarian conflicts
- Colonial-era construct from modern mass politics
- Middle classes projected imaginary interests for economic gain
- Colonial administration deliberately supported communalists
- Socio-economic distinctions reinforced religious boundaries
- Economic competition transformed into religious antagonism

#### Reasons for Growth of Communalism

##### Socio Economic Reasons

- Regional bonds were stronger than religious bonds (Bengali Muslim had more in common with Bengali Hindu than Punjabi Muslim)
- Both religions were equal victims of oppression
- Hindus: Adapted quickly to modern education and started getting into business and trade → new educated middle class developed
- Muslims: Slow to adapt to modern education, fell behind in business and trade
- British deliberately kept India industrially underdeveloped → very few jobs
- British used this to fuel communal resentment by
	- Offering special quotas
	- Promising govt positons
	- Creating competition for limited number of jobs

##### British Policy of Divide and Rule

- British attitude towards muslims
	- Before 1870s: Looked with suspicion post Wahabi and 1857 revolts
	- After 1870s: Strategic alliance; granted concessions, favours, reservations; used against nationalist forces, used Syed Ahmed Khan

##### Communalism in History writing

- Imperialist + Indian historians: Divided the Indian history into 2 phases
	- Ancient Hindu phase
	- Medieval Muslim phase (Turks, Afghans, Mughals)
- Historians ignored political and economic interests, focused on religious considerations

##### Socio-religious Reform Side-effects

- Wahabi (Muslim), Shuddhi (Hindu) movements had militant overtones
- Religion became vulnerable to communalism
- Reforms sometimes insulated communities from each other

##### Militant Nationalism Side-effects

- Early nationalists worked to remove minority fears
- ==1886==: Naoroji declared no socio-religious issues in Congress forums
- ==1889==: Congress avoided issues Muslims opposed
- Later, Hindu nationalism emerged through Tilak's festivals, anti cow slaughter campaigns
- Aurobindo's Aryanised vision and goddess-centered oaths alienated Muslims
- Communal element visible in
	- Lucknow Pact (==1916==)
	- Khilafat agitation (==1920== - ==1922==)
- Post-War National Scenario
	- Khilafat issue created Congress divisions
	- Muslim support for Turkey religious, not nationalistic
	- Muslim cultural traditions linked to West Asia, not India
	- Initially clashed with Indian nationalism
	- Later became anti-imperialist but maintained religious viewpoint

##### Communal Rejection by Majority Community

- ==1870== s
	- Hindu elites began expressing anti-Muslim sentiments
	- Fabricated narrative of British saving Hindus from Muslim oppression
	- Falsely positioned Hindi as Hindu language opposing Muslims
- ==1909==: Punjab Hindu Sabha formed, opposed Congress unity efforts
- ==1915==: All-India Hindu Mahasabha established
- ==1925==: RSS formed
- Hindu communalism initially weaker than Muslim communalism due to secular intelligentsia
- Competitive communal tendencies undermined anti-communal efforts

#### Evolution of 2 Nation Theory

| Year | Key Events in Muslim Communalism |
| --- | --- |
| 1887 | • Dufferin (Viceroy) and Colvin (Lt Governor United Provinces) attacked Congress   • Syed Ahmed Khan and Raja Shiv Prasad opposed Congress as anti-government |

| 1947 | • Pakistan created comprising Muslim majority areas of Punjab, Sindh, |

## 25\. Independence with Partition

### Attlee's Statement of February 20, 1947

- Announced British departure from Indian subcontinent

#### Main Points

- June 30, ==1948==: Deadline for power transfer regardless of Indian agreement
- Power transfer to central or provincial governments based on assembly representation
- British powers over princely states would lapse but not transfer to successor government
- Mountbatten replaced Wavell
- Statement suggested partition / balkanisation of India

#### Why a fixed date fixed by govt for withdrawal

- Intended to force agreement between parties
- Demonstrate British sincerity

#### Congress Stand

- Accepted multiple power centers as path for constituent assembly progress
- Muslim League launched civil disobedience in Punjab after statement

### Independence and Partition

- Communal riots + Unworkability of Congress-League coalition made partition increasingly acceptable
- ==1947==:
	- March: Nehru preferred Cabinet Mission solution, alternative was Punjab/Bengal partition
	- April: Kripalani (Congress president) indicated Pakistan acceptance if Bengal/Punjab fairly partitioned

#### Mountbatten as Viceroy

- Moved quickly with broader powers than predecessors
- Found Cabinet Mission Plan dead and Jinnah firm on sovereign state
- Supported unity advocates over opponents

#### Mountbatten Plan, June 3, 1947

- Freedom-with-partition formula widely accepted before announcement
- Immediate power transfer based on dominion status with secession right → avoided waiting for constituent assembly
- Main Points:
	- Punjab and Bengal Legislative Assemblies would meet separately (Hindu/Muslim) to vote on partition
	- Simple majority of either group voting for partition would trigger provincial partition
	- Partition would create two dominions and two constituent assemblies
	- Sindh would decide its own fate
- Congress concessions:
	- Independence for princely states ruled out—would join India or Pakistan
	- Independence for Bengal ruled out
	- Hyderabad independence ruled out (Mountbatten supported Congress)
	- Freedom by August 15, 1947
	- Boundary commission if partition elected
- Muslim League's demands partially met: Pakistan would be created but smaller than demanded to maintain maximum Indian unity

#### Why Congress Accepted Dominion Status

- Ensured quick power transfer and authority to manage explosive situation
- Provided bureaucracy/army continuity
- Kept India temporarily in Commonwealth

#### Rationale for August 15, 1947

- Immediate implementation
- Bengal/Punjab partitioned based on legislative votes
- Referendums determined Sylhet and NWFP's inclusion in Pakistan
- Baluchistan and Sindh joined Pakistan

#### Indian Independence Act

- ==1947==: British Parliament passed Act (July 5), royal assent (July 18), implementation (August 15)
- Created two dominions (India/Pakistan) with governor generals and constituent assemblies
- Dissolved existing Central Legislative Assembly and Council of States
- Transitional period governance → according to GOI Act 1935

Plan Balkan

- 1947: Mountbatten's alternative after Cabinet Mission Plan failed
- Offered provinces partition option; princely states could choose India/Pakistan/independence
- Abandoned after Nehru's objection

First Governor General

India → Lord Mountbatten  
Pakistan → Jinnah

#### Problems of Early Withdrawal

- Mountbatten's hasty timeline → partition anomalies → Punjab massacre
- No transitional institutions for partition challenges
- Leadership conflict: Mountbatten sought dual Governor General role, Jinnah claimed Pakistan position
- 1947: Boundary Commission results deliberately delayed (August 12-15) → British evaded responsibility for violence

### Integration of States

- State People's Movement demanded political rights and Constituent Assembly representation
- Nehru led conferences in Udaipur (1945) and Gwalior (1947), declared non-joining states hostile
- ==1947==: Patel managed integration through strategic incentives and pressure
- ==Phase I==: Most states signed accession by August 15, surrendering only defense, external affairs, communication
- ==Phase II==: Complex integration created regional unions (Kathiawar, Vindhya, Rajasthan), required constitutional changes
- Princes received privy purses, governorships as incentives
- Patel's achievement: complete political unification within one year

### Inevitability of Partition

#### Progressive concessions to Muslim League:

- ==1942==: Cripps Mission accepted Muslim provinces' autonomy
- ==1944==: Gandhi recognized Muslim-majority provinces' self-determination
- ==1946==: Cabinet Mission Plan allowed separate constituent assembly
- ==1947==: CWC acknowledged Pakistan (March), accepted 3rd June Plan

#### Gandhi's Helplessness

- Gandhi reluctantly accepted partition as people's choice while asking Congressmen to reject it internally

## 26\. Constitutional, Administrative and Judicial Developments

- East India Company: 1600 establishment, 1765 ruling body transformation
- 1773-1858: Constitutional changes serving British interests while introducing modern state elements

### Military under British

- Pre-1857: Two forces - Queen's army (Crown) and Company's troops (European and Native regiments with British officers)
- Post-1857: Reorganization to prevent future revolts
	- Indian Army: Created for territorial defense and Asian/African expansion
	- British Section: Served as occupation force guaranteeing control
	- European dominance ensured through fixed ratios ($1:2$ in Bengal, $2:5$ in Madras/Bombay)

### Development of Judiciary in British India

- Pre-colonial India

	- Muslim litigation: Qazi, religious person
- ==1726==: Common law system started with Mayor's Courts in Madras, Bombay, Calcutta by East India Company

#### Reforms under Warren Hastings (1772-85)

> Only Muslim law was used in criminal cases because the Mughal Empire had made it the criminal code across India. It was simpler to keep using the system already in place and helped make British rule seem more legitimate by keeping things consistent.
