#### Common aspects in approach

## 20\. Debates on the Future Strategy after Civil Disobedience Movement

- Two-stage debate
	- ==1934== - ==1935==: Immediate strategy
	- ==1937==: Office acceptance question in provincial elections under GOI Act 1935
		- First stage presented three perspectives: Gandhian constructive work, constitutional participation, leftist mass struggle

### The First Stage Debate

- Perspective 1: Constructive work on Gandhian lines
- Perspective 2: Constitutional struggle advocates argued elections maintain political interest without implying faith in constitutional politics
- Perspective 3: Nehru-led leftists rejected both approaches, favored continued mass struggle against colonialism

#### Nehru's Vision

#### Nehru's Opposition to Struggle-Truce-Struggle Strategy

- Gandhi supporters favoured alternating struggle and recovery phases (==S-T-S==)
- Nehru advocated continuous confrontation through direct action
- Proposed Struggle-Victory (==S-V==) strategy without constitutional compromise

#### Finally, Yes to Council Entry

### GOI Act 1935

- [Different Acts by the British > Government of India Act 1935 > Administration](https://upsckata.com/2.1+Polity/Notes/Different+Acts+by+the+British#Government%20of%20India%20Act%201935#Administration)
- [Different Acts by the British > Government of India Act 1935 > Central Legislature](https://upsckata.com/2.1+Polity/Notes/Different+Acts+by+the+British#Government%20of%20India%20Act%201935#Central%20Legislature)

#### Evaluation

- Governor general's ==safeguards== + ==special responsibilities== hindered proper functioning
- Governor retained extensive powers
- Limited franchise (14% population)
- Communal electorates fostered separatism leading to partition
- Rigid constitution with amendment rights reserved for British Parliament

##### Long-Term British Strategy

- Short term: Suppress movement
- Long term: Weaken national movement, integrate large segment of movement into colonial, constitutional and administrative structure
- Reforms to revive political standing of constitutional liberals who lost support during Civil Disobedience
- Aimed to convince Congressmen of ineffectiveness of extra-legal struggle
- Create dissensions within Congress: placate right wing, crush radical leftists
- Provincial autonomy would create powerful provincial leaders, weakening central leadership

#### Nationalists' Response

- 1935 Act rejected by Congress, supported by Hindu Mahasabha and National Liberal Foundation
- Congress demanded adult franchise-based ==Constituent Assembly==

### The Second Stage Debate

- 1937: Provincial elections announced
- Strategy debate resumed → 1935 Act was to be opposed but unclear since mass movement not possible
- Ideological divisions emerged on post-election approach

#### Divided Opinion

#### Congress Manifesto

#### Elections and Congress Performance

- Nationalist strategy vindicated, prestige increased

## 21\. Congress Rule in Provinces

	- Emphasized practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge
- Ideological Boundaries
	- Rejected racial superiority theories despite Bose's tactical alliances
	- Disliked communism as political system for India

Gandhi's Ramrajya

- Written in Hind Swaraj
- Utopia that did not need a representative, a constitution, an army or a police force
- Built on the concept of truth, non violence and self regulation
- Capitalism, communism, exploitation and religious violence would be absent

### Second World War and Nationalistic Response

- 1939: Germany attacked Poland September 1, Britain declared war September 3
- British India declared support without Indian consultation

#### Congress Offer to Viceroy

- Conditional war support with two requirements
	- Post-war constituent assembly
	- Immediate responsible government
- Linlithgow rejected offer despite Congress argument conditions needed for public support

#### CWC Meeting at Wardha

### Government Attitude and Congress Ministries' Resignation

- Linlithgow's negative response (October 17) leveraged Muslim League + Princes against Congress
- Government refused to define war aims, proposed consultative committee only

#### Government's Hidden Agenda

- British policy used war to regain control, implemented emergency powers
- Defence ordinance restricted civil liberties; May 1940 draft prepared for pre-emptive strikes
- Aimed to win liberal and leftist sympathy by showing Congress as pro Japan and Germany
- Churchill supported reactionary policies, branded Congress as Hindu organization

##### Congress Ministries Decide to Resign

##### Debate on the Question of Immediate Mass Satyagraha

- Gandhi opposed immediate struggle due to just allied cause, communal sensitivities and organisational weakness
- Advocated political work before launching struggle
- ==1940==: Linlithgow → Goal of British policy in India is Dominion status after war

##### November 1939 CWC Resolution

- Declared war fought for imperialist ends like WWI
- Demanded independence and constituent assembly

##### The Ramgarh Session (March 1940)

- Internal disagreement between Gandhi's cooperation and Nehru/Bose's militancy
- Congress demanded complete independence, not dominion status
- Civil disobedience would begin when organization ready

##### Pakistan Resolution—Lahore (March 1940)

- Muslim League called for independent Muslim-majority states

### August Offer (1940)

- Proposed
	- Dominion status
	- Indian-majority viceroy's executive council
	- Post-war constituent assembly
	- No constitution without minorities consent
- Congress rejected, Muslim League supported, reaffirmed partition demand

#### Evaluation

- & First recognition of Indians' right to frame constitution
- Congress demand for constituent assembly conceded
- July ==1941==: Viceroy's executive council expanded with Indian majority (8 of 12)

### Individual Satyagraha

- Gandhi initiated limited civil disobedience against war participation
- Aims
	- Show nationalist patience not weakness
	- Express disinterest in war
	- Give government opportunity to accept demands
- 25,000 convicted by May ==1941==, evolved into "Delhi Chalo Movement"

### Gandhi-Nehru Relationship

- December ==1941==: Congress leaders released after Japan's attack
- CWC overruled Gandhi/Nehru objections, passed resolution to cooperate in defense if
	- Full independence after war
	- Immediate transfer of substantial power
- Gandhi designated Nehru as successor despite differences
	- Temperament: Nehru secular, Gandhi religious
	- Development: Nehru favoured industrialisation, Gandhi rural revival
	- State power: Nehru believed in modern state, Gandhi in individual conscience
- Gandhi chose Nehru because he reflected pluralist, inclusive idea of India
- Nehru was Hindu trusted by Muslims, northerner respected in south, admired by women

### Cripps Mission

- March ==1942==: Stafford Cripps sent to India with constitutional proposals seeking war support
- Cripps: left-wing Labourite, supported Indian national movement

#### Why Mission Sent

- Japanese threat to India made Indian support crucial
- Allied pressure (USA, USSR, China) for Indian cooperation
- Nationalists demanded immediate power transfer and post-war independence

#### Main Proposals

- Indian Union: dominion status, freedom to determine international relations
- Constituent assembly: partly elected, partly prince-nominated members to frame constitution
- British acceptance with conditions: provinces could opt out, treaty required for power transfer
- Defence temporarily remains under British control

##### Departures from Past and Implications

- Constitution-making fully Indian-controlled (not "mainly" as in August Offer)
- Concrete assembly plan established
- Provincial separation option → ==blueprint for partition==
- Commonwealth withdrawal permitted
- Increased interim Indian administration

#### Why Mission Failed

- Congress rejected
	- Dominion status instead of independence
	- Princely state nomination system
	- Provincial secession rights
	- No immediate power transfer
- Muslim League opposed
	- Single Indian Union concept
	- Denied self-determination for Pakistan
- Churchill administration undermined Cripps' efforts
- Gandhi called scheme ==post-dated cheque==
- Secession procedure poorly defined, requiring 60% legislative majority
- Cripps returned leaving frustrated and embittered Indian people

## 23\. Quit India Movement, Demand for Pakistan, and the INA

### Quit India Movement

- July 14, ==1942==: Gandhi framed British withdrawal resolution after Cripps' failure
- CWC at Wardha accepted struggle against British

#### Why Start a Struggle Now

- Cripps Mission failure revealed unchanged British attitude toward Indian self-determination
- Economic hardships, commandeering of resources, possibility of scorched earth policies in eastern India against Japanese advance
- British defeats in Southeast Asia emboldened Indians, shattered colonial prestige
- Discriminatory evacuation policies (==Black Road/White Road==) exposed racial attitudes
- Condition masses for possible Japanese invasion

#### The 'Quit India' Resolution

- ==1942==
	- Congress authorized Gandhi to lead non-violent movement
	- August 8: Ratified at Gowalia Tank (Bombay) and demanded immediate British withdrawal
	- Called for free India to resist fascism, provisional government, civil disobedience

#### Gandhi's Instructions

- Instructions given at Gowalia Tank meeting but not officially issued
- Government servants: Declare allegiance to Congress without resigning
- Soldiers: Remain in army but refuse to fire on compatriots
- Students: Leave studies if confident
- Peasants: Pay rent to supportive zamindars, withhold from anti-government zamindars
- Princes: Support masses and accept people's sovereignty
- Princely states' people: Support ruler only if anti-government
- Gandhi's mantra: "Do or Die" - achieve free India or die trying

#### Movement Spread

- August 9: All top Congress leaders arrested, organizations (Congress Working Committee, All Indian Congress Committee, Provincial Congress Committee) banned
- ==Aruna Asaf Ali== (1st mayor Delhi) presided over Congress committee session → hoisted flag
- Public attacked authority symbols, infrastructure sabotaged (bridges blown, railway tracks removed, telegraph lines cut)
- Strongest in United Provinces, Bihar; students and workers led protests

#### Underground Activity

#### Parallel Governments

- Supported by businessmen, students, villagers, sympathetic officials

| Region | Time Period | Leaders | Key Activities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ballia | August 1942 (one week) | Chittu Pandey | • Released Congress leaders   • Took control of local administration |
| Tamluk/Midnapore | December 1942 to September 1944 | Satish Chandra Samanta | • Organized relief work   • Sanctioned grants to schools   • Distributed paddy from rich to poor   • Managed "Jatiya Sarkar" (National Government) |
| Satara | Mid-1943 to 1945 | Y.B. Chavan, Nana Patil | • Organized "Prati Sarkar" (Parallel Government)   • Established village libraries   • Created Nyayadan Mandals (justice system)   • Conducted prohibition campaigns   • Performed "Gandhi marriages" |

#### Extent of Mass Participation

- Youth → Students led movement from forefront
- Women → Active participants included Aruna Asaf Ali, Sucheta Kripalani, Usha Mehta
- Workers → Conducted strikes, faced repression
- Peasants → Central to movement, targeted authority symbols without anti-zamindar violence
- Government officials → Lower-level police and administrators participated → eroded government loyalty
- Muslims → Provided shelter to underground activists, no communal clashes occurred
- Communists → Initially abstained → supported British after Nazi attack on Russia
- Muslim League → Opposed movement fearing Hindu oppression of minorities
- Hindu Mahasabha → Boycotted movement
- Princely states → Showed minimal response

#### Government Repression

- Severe measures: lathi-charges, tear-gas, firing; estimated 10,000 killed
- Press censored; military control of cities
- Collective village punishment (heavy fines, mass flogging)

#### Estimate

- Violence spread without leadership; movement centered in eastern provinces
- Students, workers, peasants formed backbone while elites remained loyal
- Established India couldn't be ruled without Indians' consent
- Placed independence as immediate agenda with unprecedented public heroism

#### Gandhi Fasts

- February ==1943==: Fast against state violence gained overwhelming support
- Three council members resigned; raised morale, exposed government brutality

> March 23, ==1943==: Pakistan Day observed

### Famine of 1943

- 1.5-3 million died in man-made Bengal famine
- Causes
	- Diverted foodstuffs for army
	- Stopped rice imports
	- Gross mismanagement
	- Deliberate profiteering
	- Belated rationing methods

### Rajagopalachari Formula (1944)

- CR proposed Congress-League cooperation framework
- Provisions
	- Muslim League to support independence; join provisional government
	- Muslim-majority areas to decide on Pakistan through post-war plebiscite
	- Joint arrangements for defense/commerce if partition occurred
	- Required complete British power transfer
- Jinnah's response: Demanded two-nation theory acceptance, only Muslims to vote in plebiscite
- Congress position: Willing to cooperate for Indian Union integrity but not separate nation
- Hindu leaders under Vir Savarkar: Condemned CR Plan

### Desai-Liaqat Pact

- Desai (Congress) and Liaqat (Muslim League) proposed interim government
- Equal Congress-League representation, 20% minority seats
- No settlement reached despite parity agreement

### Wavell Plan

- 1945: Churchill government sought India solution as WWII in Europe ended
- Government motivations
	- Upcoming UK elections
	- Allied pressure for more Indian Cooperation in war
	- Redirecting Indian energies to profitable channels
- Plan
	- Indians in executive council except governor general and commander-in-chief
	- Equal representation for Caste Hindus and Muslims
	- Council to function as interim government within 1935 Act framework (not responsible to Central Assembly)
	- Governor general retained veto power on ministers' advice
	- Parties to submit joint list of nominees; separate lists if no agreement
	- Future constitution negotiations possible after war

#### Muslim League stand

#### Congress stand

- Rejected being reduced to "purely caste Hindu party"
- Insisted on right to nominate members from all communities

#### Wavell's Mistake

- Announced breakdown of talks, giving League a virtual veto → strengthened League's position, boosted muslim separatism, weakened Churchill's govt
- Boosted Muslim separatism and weakened Churchill's Conservative government

### The Indian National Army and Subhas Bose

- Bose: militant nationalist, resigned Civil Services (1921) to join freedom struggle
- Rejected Gandhi's non-violence, sought independent path
- ==1940==
	- March: Organized ==Anti-Compromise Conference== at Ramgarh (joint efffort of Forward Block + Kisan Sabha)
