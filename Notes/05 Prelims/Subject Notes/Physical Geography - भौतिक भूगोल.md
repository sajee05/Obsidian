# Winds | Aeolian Landforms

- - Erosional - Pediments and Pediplain, Playas, deflation hollows and caves, mushroom, table and pedestal rocks
        - Erosion is carried in three ways - deflation(removing unsorted dust particles), abrasion(sand grains particles eroding rocks), attrition(wear and tear of sand).

# Climate

## Atmosphere

**Energy in the atmosphere** 

- - Energy in the atmosphere (Energy budget/heat budget). Earth's interior energy is negligible as compared to solar energy. Vertical and horizontal.
    - A vertical heat budget is a balanced budget in terms of received and returned - Net saved = zero.
    - Heat Energy - Latent and specific.
    - Measuring latent heat is not easy.
    - Earth average temperature has not changed substantially over the last nearly 4 billion years.
    - Anything in the universe above absolute zero temperature releases heat.
    - The hotter equatorial tropical regions have a net surplus heat budget whereas the cooler polar regions have a net deficit heat budget when seen horizontally over the earth's surface.

**Factors/elements of Weather and Climate**

- - Temperature.
    - Precipitation.
    - Winds.
    - Humidity.
    - Pressure.
    - Visibility.
    - Sunlight.
    - Clouds.
    - Different phenomenon over a short period is called weather phenomena and over a long period, they are called climatic phenomenon.

##### Composition of the atmosphere

- - Gases in the atmosphere - nitrogen, oxygen, argon etc.
    - The atmosphere ends vertically at a height of 3500 km within mean sea level. (NCERT)
    -  But, some other sources might state up to 10000 km because generally up to there some hydrogen gases have been found, (only trace amount).
    - Apart from the gases, there are other particles also such as dust particles and water vapours.
    - The atmospheric gases are found up to a height of _88 km from the mean sea level in the same proportion as given in the composition table._
    - This region is called the homosphere because it is homogenous in composition.
    - The other region 88-3500 km is called heterogeneous because the densest gases like nitrogen, oxygen are only found in the lowest levels whereas the lighter gases are only found in the highest levels.
    - The dust particle in the atmosphere is only found in the lowest layer of the atmosphere which is the troposphere.
    - Because the dust particle mostly originates from the land surface and the ocean hence most of the dust particles are concentrated near the earth surface.
    - Even in the troposphere, they grew out thinning as we go higher.
    - The dust particle mostly originates from sea salt, fine soil particles, smoke, soot (unburnt particle), ash, pollen and meteor dust.
    - The water vapours in the atmosphere vary from 4% of the total atmospheric composition which is the maximum to less than 1% of the total atmospheric composition normally in the desert regions.
    - Most of the water vapour is also found only in the troposphere.
    - Water vapour is added by evaporation, transpiration and sublimation.

- - **Dust particles and water vapours**
        - Many dust particles have a hygroscopic nature and due to this, they tend to play a major role in the formation of or condensation of water vapour back into water droplets.
        - By this process, it leads to the formation of different suspended atmospheric water bodies like clouds, mist, fog, dew and frost etc.
        - Dust particles play the role of hygroscopic molecules.
        - All of these are formed due to the role of dust particles which play the role of hygroscopic molecules.
        - Dust particles are formed near the land and when we go higher dust particles reduce.

### Structure of the atmosphere

- - It can be understood based on temperature variation and composition.
    - On basis of chemical composition - homogenous and heterogeneous.

**Atmospheric structure on the basis of temperature**

As we go higher in atmosphere, temp decreases by normal lapse rate.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 32.png>)

##### Troposphere

- - Extends up to 8km on poles and up to 18 km on the equator.
    - Because the temperature around the equatorial region is hotter and at poles, it is cooler, the air around the equatorial region heat up - expands - becomes lighter and hence rises.
    - The opposite happens on poles.
    - The air mixes up in the atmosphere.
    - It is the sphere of mixing of the air, hence the name troposphere (Tropo = mixing).
    - The tropopause is the region where the mixing of the air comes to an end and hence it separates the troposphere from the above spheres.
    - Beyond the troposphere, there is no season, weather or climate.
    - All the atmospheric horizontal heat transfer takes place here and hence most of the weather and climatic phenomena take place here.
    - As we go higher in the atmosphere the air tends to cool because rising air expands, hence lesser inter-particle friction and collision and hence lesser temperature.
    - The average fall in temperature with height in the troposphere is around 1 degree Celsius for every 165 meters of rising, which is nearly 6-6.5 degrees fall for every 1 km rise - Normal lapse rate.
        - 1 degree reduction in for 165 m increase in height.
    - Temperature at Tropopause above the equator is -80 and above pole is -45.
    - Tropopause in mid-latitudes during summer is higher, around 15 km.
    - The tropopause in the mid-latitude during winters is lower around 12.5 km.

##### Stratosphere

- - Because the UV radiations coming from the upper part of the space hence most of the UV is absorbed in the upper part of the ozone region and hence as we go higher in the stratosphere the temperature again starts to increase.
    - All UVC, some UVB is absorbed in the ozone layer and all UVA passes through it.
    - The ozone layer absorb the UV radiation and most of this absorbed UV radiation is released back at the same layer as heat energy.
    - By the time we reach stratopause the temperature increase to around -15 degrees to -2.5 degrees.
    - The layer of the atmosphere lies between the troposphere and the mesosphere.
    - The lower portion of the stratosphere is nearly isothermal (a layer of constant temperature), whereas temperatures in its upper levels increase with altitude.
    - The temperature inversion happens because as sun rays comes down in stratosphere there is less and less rays for absorption, the isothermal layer is due to the balanced effect by heat given off by earth.

##### Mesosphere

- - It is the region where most of the particles falling from space ultimately fully get burnt.
    - It goes to around 80kms from MSL.
    - The temperature decreases and is around minus 100 degrees. — it is the coldest natural place in earth’s system.

##### Thermosphere

- - The thermosphere extends up to a height of 400 km above mean sea level.
    - Here, the air density becomes very thin and hence very few gas particles, far separated from each other.
    - The temperature shoots up to 1500 degrees.
    - The heated gas particles turn into ions and hence we call the region an ionosphere.
    - Ions are electrically charged particles.
    - Because of these electrically charged particles, the ionosphere can deviate the radio waves.
    - Radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer.
    - Auroras are created around the Ionosphere region when solar charged particles and ionosphere particle interacts with the earth's magnetic field. (solar charged particles are electrically charged particles).

##### Exosphere

- - Extends up to 3500 Km.
    - Particles are much rare and are hotter.
    - The temperature at exopause is the same as the surface of the sun and the earth's centre (around 5000 degrees celsius).

### Heating and cooling of the atmosphere

- - The earth gets nearly 2 billionth parts which mean 2 parts out of a billion parts of the total heat released by the sun.
    - It is nearly 1.94 calories per square cm per minute on top of the atmosphere(exosphere).
    - Hence two billionth part of the sun's heat that we receive, we call incoming solar radiation or we call it insolation.
    - The insolation mainly has visible light (VIBGYOR) and infrared radiation.
    - The UV radiation also reaches close to the earth surface but finally gets absorbed by ozone.
    - The insolation received on the earth surface is not the same but varies from place to place.
    - There are different factors that affect insolation received at different places on the earth's surface.

**Factors affecting insolation received on the earth's surface**

- - Rotation of the earth - night side, no sunlight and dayside different amount of sunlight during different parts of the daylight.
    - Revolution of the earth - it alone has a very negligible role in insolation variation on the earth if considered without the tilted axis of the earth.
    - Earth's shape - the earth shape (spherical) gives every location on the earth a slightly different inclination with respect to the falling sun rays.
    - The inclination of the earth itself with respect to the revolution orbit of the earth due to which we get the seasons.
    - Inclination also gives us the different duration of daylight and night hence affecting the total insolation received.
    - Affect of slope - slope toward the sun receive more sunlight and vice versa in mountainous regions.
    - Aspect effect - one side of the slope receives more sunlight(sunlight facing) and one side receives less in the mountains.
    - Transparency of the atmosphere - cloudy regions and dusty regions will have less transparency and hence low sunlight.
    - Sunspots also impact the amount of insolation received due to the dark sunspots created due to localised magnetic fields on the sun's surface. 
    - Sunspots have a cycle of 11 years and do have some effect on the insolation.

**Insolation received at different places on the earth's surface**

- - On earth's surface, in a tropical region, we receive a minimum of 70 watts per meter square of sunlight and a maximum of 320 watts per meter square.
    - On the equator, we receive less than 320 watts per meter square of sunlight.
    - Near the oceanic regions, the insolation is relatively lesser than in the continental interior due to low humidity and cloudiness.

**Processes involved in heating**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 33.png>)

- - The region of the atmosphere which is directly in contact with a hotter surface is heating due to _conduction._
    - The upper atmospheric air above the hotter region will get heated due to _convection._
    - Radiation does not need moving particles, wherever sunlight reaches, some heating will occur due to _radiation._
    - With respect to the atmosphere heating, there are two parts of the radiation that we talk of - insolation (direct sunlight) and Terrestrial radiation.
    - Both types of radiation heat the atmosphere but insolation heats very less directly and terrestrial radiation, high heating.
    - _Radiation_ depends on the temperature of the surface.
    - The low energy terrestrial radiation is easier to block for the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which first absorbs this heat and then hence heats up the atmosphere.
    - Hence the troposphere mostly gets heated by terrestrial radiation whereas the insolation (higher energy radiation) easily passes through the troposphere and hence heats it lesser.
    - Almost the whole of the atmosphere will get heated by radiation.
    - The lower part of the troposphere is more heated and the upper part is less heated.

- - Condensational heat release in the atmosphere in addition to the 4 processes written above.
    - The transfer of heat or matter by the flow of a fluid, especially horizontally in the atmosphere or the sea is called advection.

##### Vertical heating and cooling of the atmosphere/Vertical heat budget

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 34.png>)

- - The earth receives a certain amount of insulation (short waves) and gives back heat into space by terrestrial radiation (longwave radiation).
    - Through this inflow and outflow of heat, the earth maintains a constant temperature and this phenomenon is referred to as the heat budget of the earth.
    - Consider that the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere is 100 per cent.
    - While passing through the atmosphere some amount of energy is reflected, scattered and absorbed.
    - Only the remaining part reaches the earth surface.
    - Roughly 35 units are reflected back to space even before reaching the earth’s surface.
    - Of these, 27 units are reflected back from the top of the clouds and 2 units from the snow and ice-covered areas of the earth.
    - The reflected amount of radiation is called the albedo of the earth.
    - The remaining 65 units are absorbed, 14 units within the atmosphere and 51 units by the earth’s surface.
    - The earth radiates back 51 units in the form of terrestrial radiation.
    - Of these, 17 units are radiated to space directly and the remaining 34 units are absorbed by the atmosphere (6 units absorbed directly by the atmosphere, 9 units through convection and turbulence and 19 units through latent heat of condensation).
    - 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (14 units from insolation + 34 units from terrestrial radiation) are also radiated back into space.
    - Thus, the total radiation returning from the earth and the atmosphere respectively is 17+48=65 units which balance the total of 65 units received from the sun.
    - Reflected back (2%) heat doesn't play any role in the heating of the atmosphere.
    - **The 65% heat stored temporarily with the earth system keeps the earth system relatively warm.**
    - But, ultimately even this 65% of the heat is finally released back to space making the earth's net budget a balanced budget.
    - 23% is radiated by the earth system.
    - 9% is released by convection to the atmosphere.
    - Only 17% is released back to the space and the remaining 34% is first absorbed by the atmosphere which plays a major role in heating the atmosphere.
    - Because this heat is released from the bottom of the troposphere hence the bottom of the troposphere gets most heated and therefore we say the troposphere is heated most by terrestrial radiation.
    - This way the atmosphere had 14% earlier and 34% more adding to it hence a total of 48% is added to the atmosphere directly or indirectly.
    - This 48% of the heat keeps the atmosphere warm in fulfilling the goldilocks zone condition and hence supporting life.
    - But till this heat remains in the atmospheric system, it keeps the atmosphere warm by atmospheric radiation.
    - The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hold up 48% of heat in the atmosphere.
    - Though the 48% heat is not held up forever in the atmosphere, it is constantly present in the atmosphere to keep it continuously warm.
    - If the content of greenhouse gases increases especially by abnormal or unnatural interventions like human intervention, it can cause an unnatural increase in the overall earth's temperature.
    - The kind of global warming we are experiencing presently.

**Horizontal heat budget** 

- - As we see in the horizontal heat budget that the lower latitude regions are in the net heat surplus region whereas the higher latitude regions are a net deficit region.
    - But, because the whole earth on average has a balanced heat budget.
    - Therefore the surplus heat is transferred to the deficit regions.

A) through the atmosphere which hence created different weather and climatic phenomena giving us different weathers, seasons and climates in different regions.

B) through the ocean creating different movements and related phenomena in the ocean.

- - This is how different weather and climate are created on the earth.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 35.png>)

## Weather and Climate

- - Some climates have distinct seasons - Summer, winter, autumn and spring.
    - The most important similarity between weather, seasons and climate is primarily the 8 elements that we use to objectively quantify these three phenomena.
    - 8 Elements - Temperature, pressure, winds, humidity - condensation, clouds, precipitation, visibility and sunshine.

### Temperature

- - Temperature is the measure of the specific heat of a body.
    - The lowest temperature possible is zero kelvin - absolute zero.
    - The average temperature of the universe is -270 degree. 
    - Important of temperature;
        - The basic requirement of the goldilocks zone.
        - Energy always flows from high to low.
        - It also decides the moisture content in the atmosphere.
        - More temperature implies More possibility of evaporation if the moisture is available and also a higher capacity of the air to hold moisture.
        - Warmer air has more potential to hold moisture.
        - This does not mean every time air temperature is high, it has more moisture.
    - On earth, different regions have different temperatures.

**Different factors which affect the temperature in different regions** 

- - **_Latitude_** - temperature increases from the equator to tropic and then decreases from tropics to poles.
    - **_Altitude_** - The lapse rate during summers is higher as also during daytime.
    - On the other hand, the lapse rate during winter is low as also during night-time.
    - During night-time or winter, the earth's surface temperature at mean sea level is also low.

- - _Continentality and maritime effects_ - During the colder period land become very cold and during warmer period it becomes very hot, whereas water has the tendency to be less cold during colder period and less warm during warmer period.
    - Water or water bodies need to exchange more heat for bringing a 1-degree change in temperature whereas land bodies need less heat to change the temperature by 1 degree.
    - In summers if you are standing in the middle of the continent and middle of the ocean (same day, same latitude and same time), more heat will be felt more on the continent.
    - This is called continentality.
    - The continent has a more severe temperature and oceans have a moderating behaviour with respect to temperature.

- - **Continentality:**
        - **Severing character**
        - **When we are talking about the interior of a continent, continentality means the regions away from the coast.**
        - **When we are talking about oceans the continentality means parts of the ocean closer to the continent.**
    - **Maritime influence (Ocean currents)**
        - **Moderating character**
        - **Maritime means regions of the ocean away from the continent's coast.**
        - **Generally, we talk about the maritime effect on the continent.**
        - **It means coastal regions are affected by the ocean.**
        - **Ocean Currents are of 2 types:**
            - **Surface ocean currents and**
            - **Deep ocean currents**
    - Surface ocean currents affect the temperature of the coastal regions —- they are unidirectional, generally around the year, wide(100-200km) flow of water in the ocean. If they come from colder region we call them cold currents and visa versa. 
    - Warm current moving to coastal regions makes such coast relatively warm and visa versa.
    - The moderating character of maritime regions means that such regions during summers remain relatively less hot.
    - Whereas during winters they remain relatively less cold.

- - **Airmass**
        - **Huge parcel of air having uniform characteristics such as temperature or humidity, spreading over thousands of Kms and stretching up to the tropopause.**
        - **Because they have uniform character, they are called warm or cold air mass wrt each other.**
        - **Warm air masses, if they move to colder regions they make such regions relatively warmer.**
        - **Whereas cold air masses make a warm region relatively cooler.**

- - **Slope, Shelter, and aspect:**
        - **The slope is cooler than flat regions and shelter is cooler than sunny regions**
        - **Aspect: The sun-facing side is warmer.(example of Himalayas)**
    - **Natural Vegetation:**
        - **Moderating effect**
        - **Cooling effect in warm areas and a warming effect in cool areas.**
    - **Types of surface:**
        - **Wet surfaces have a moderating effect and Dry surface has a severing effect**
        - **The albedo effect also plays a role.**
        - **Light surfaces reflect sunlight and as a result, are cooler.(have less albedo)**
        - **While dark surfaces absorb light and as a result are warmer(Have high albedo)**

**Temperature distribution on Earth's surfaces**

- - Isotherms are the lines connecting places with similar temperatures.
    - If we consider only the effect of latitudes and not of others then in some ways we find that latitudes also tend to behave like isotherms.
    - Considering only the latitude factor, we can generally arrange the isotherms parallel to the latitudes.
    - Assuming the Earth was only made of oceans, one can say that isotherms would be parallel to latitudes.

##### How does the presence of continents affect the isotherms?

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 36.png>)

- - If there is no continent then the summer region isotherm would have been parallel to latitudes.
    - But due to the presence of continents, the isotherms have been bent, and as we can see the summer isotherms are bent poleward over the continents due to continentality.
    - We can say this in another way that **during summers** if we go along the isotherms from oceans to continents then the isotherms bent poleward.
    - Whereas if we go from continent to oceans the isotherms bent equatorward.
    - On the contrary, during winters when we travel along the isotherms from oceans towards continents, the isotherms bend equatorward.
    - The bending is more in Northern Hemisphere.
    - Isotherms are relatively parallel over the southern hemisphere.
    - The average temperature of the Earth is 15 degrees Celsius.
    - The summer maximum temperature noted anywhere on the Earth is 60 degrees.
    - It is 45 degrees more than average.
    - The lowest temperature is noted in the Arctic and Siberian region.
    - It is close to -80 degrees Celsius.
    - Hence the most extreme temperature on the Earth is experienced during Winters.
    - Hence, the isotherms bend relatively more in the winter season (December-January).

**Temperature range**

- - It means the deviation in the temperature from the normal temperature.
    - The temperature ranges are measured both annually as well as daily(diurnal).
    - In the case of annual, we talk about the coldest month average and hottest month average.
    - In the case of diurnal, we talk about the coldest temperature and hottest temperature of the day.
    - Some regions have a high diurnal range where the daytime temperature is very high and same day's night time temperature is very low.
    - The maximum diurnal range (means maximum temperature range within a day, the range b/w afternoon and the same day’s late midnight) is found in tropical deserts.
    - e.g. Thar desert, Sahara desert.
    - Diurnal Range is very less in equatorial coastal regions.
    - The maximum annual range is found in the Siberian region.
    - The minimum annual range/diurnal range is found in Equatorial coastal regions.

##### Temperature inversion

- - Temperature inversion is the special case where vertically the temperature change reverses in the atmosphere.
    - It means the temperature starts increasing with an increase in altitude.
    - There is no fixed rate for temperature inversion.
    - It varies from situation to situation.
    - Different types of Inversions:
        - 1. Radiation inversion: It takes place in plains.
        - 2. Subsidence inversion: It takes place in mountains and valleys.
        - 3. Marine inversion: It takes place in coastal regions specially where sea temp gets colder.
        - 4. Frontal inversion: It takes place when fronts are formed between air masses, especially during the occlusion of fronts.

**Radiation inversion:**

- - Conditions: Cold winter nights, clear sky, still air or very slow winds.
    - During the night in winter, the earth’s surface tends to radiate (heat radiated is more than heat absorbed.)
    - Hence the surface cools down.
    - Temperature decreases as per altitude:
    - Surface: warm, mid-altitude: cool, high altitude: cooler.
    - But during winter nights: Earth’s surface will become cooler than the air at lower altitudes gets cooler with it( against the normal lapse rate).
    - Hence we experience radiation inversion.
    - Above certain altitudes, the temperature will start decreasing again (normal conditions).
    - The clear skies allow the radiated heat to scape through the troposphere as there are no clouds to absorb and reflect back this heat. If clouds are present they do not let the heat to escape and some of the heat is reflected back to plains and will not let the plains to cool down. —— hence no inversion.

**Role of clouds:**

- - Radiated heat escapes through the troposphere, as there are no clouds to absorb and reflect back this heat.
    - If clouds are present, they do not let the heat to escape, and some of the heat will be reflected back to the plains and will not let plains to cool down.

**Role of winds:**

- - If winds are strong, They might remove the cool air; hence inversion type conditions will not form.
    - Radiation inversion can lead to the formation of dew and frost condensation on the earth’s surface, and also fog and mist condensation in the lowest layer of the troposphere.

**Subsidence/Valley Inversion:**

- - It takes place between the valleys between the hills.
    - As the air between valleys becomes cold, it also becomes dense.
    - Dense air tends to go down the valley.
    - From hill slopes, it tends to go down the valley.
    - The warmer valley air will be lifted up.
    - During cold nights on the hill-upper slopes, the air cools down, and hence syncs, hence the denser air goes down the slope into the valley.
    - And the warmer lighter valley air is lifted up. 
    - Hence inversion conditions are created in the valley, up to a certain height in the valley.
    - This way the valley gets colder than the slopes of the hill.
    - Hence, in regions where inversion is frequent, and the valley experiences frost and fog frequently, in the valley, the hill residents generally build their homes on the slopes where it is warmer in night, and also agriculture and food crops are grown in the slopes.
    - As frequent fog and frost is harmful for the crops.(contrary is written in NCERT which is wrong)
    - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 19.jpeg>)

**Trapping of cold air:**

- - As shown in the subsidence inversion diagram, The cold surface might get trapped as the warm wind coming from another side of the hill envelopes, which is lighter also, will trap this cold air.
    - Warm air will not allow it to escape.
    - Lighter warm air will keep moving.
    - Pollutants in the region will also remain trapped in the region, increasing pollution.
    - Even in the plains, due to radiation inversion, when the surface air gets cooled, the pollutants in the air are trapped especially over cities.
    - And the cold air does not rise, because the upper air is relatively warmer, and hence the pollution remains trapped. — this is why there is higher pollution in Delhi during winters. - Temperature Inversion

**Marine Inversion:** 

- - It takes place near colder, oceanic coastal regions.
    - E.g. temperate and sub-polar regions. 
    - It takes place during the Spring season when the winters are over and the summers are about to start.
    - The land becomes warmer faster, and air above the coastal region becomes warmer faster. 
    - At the same time ocean relatively becomes colder, hence the air above the ocean is also relatively cooler.
    - Due to this, when the coastal warmer air tends to rise, the cooler oceanic air moves towards the coastal region.
    - Hence on the coastal regions, inversion conditions are created, known as marine coastal inversion.
    - Frontal Inversion: will be covered when we talk about air masses and fronts.

### Pressure

- - Pressure is force per unit area (by something).
    - Atmospheric pressure is the force per unit area put by air in a region on the surrounding surface.
    - The normal atmospheric pressure that we generally talk about is the atmospheric pressure measured at mean sea level.
    - It is not just the weight of the air, in the atmosphere, but it is due to the weight.
    - Atmospheric pressure acts in all directions.
    - The pressure is measured by a barometer, and we used the unit millibar.
    - Normal atmospheric pressure at Mean Sea Level is 1013.2 millibars.
    - Atmospheric pressure also decreases with height, as the air gets thinner as we go higher.
    - When we talk of the atmospheric pressure on earth, we normally have horizontal pressure on the earth's surface. 
    - Hence, places having the same pressure are shown by a line called an isobar.
    - The normal mean sea level pressure range on the earth is 960 millibar to up to 1040 millibars.
    - The decrease in pressure accounts for 1mb for each 10m increase in elevation.

- - Air movement: 
        - At low pressure: Air enters horizontally and exits vertically.
        - In cold places, high-pressure areas: The air comes ‘vertically in’ and gets horizontally out (downward air will create more weight, high-pressure conditions).
    - Pressures created due to heating and cooling are called as thermally created high pressure and low pressures.
    - When on the surface we have low pressure (e.g. 960 mb), we have relatively high pressure at the tropopause, but not with respect to the earth’s surface pressure. Hence, this upper atmosphere high pressure e.g. 250 mb.
    - When on the earth’s surface, e.g. 1040 mb, then above it in the upper atmosphere, we have relatively low pressure, (e.g. 160 mb), with respect to the upper atmosphere's high pressure (**hence we mostly compare pressure horizontally only**).
    - In order to eliminate the effect of altitude on pressure, it is measured at any station after being reduced to sea level for purposes of comparison.
    - The upper atmosphere high-pressure/low-pressure, are created mechanically.
    - Hence we have learned, that relative high-pressure and low-pressure conditions can be created both mechanically and thermally.

### Wind

- - Near horizontally, the air moves from high pressure to low pressure.
    - Both near the earth's surface or in the atmosphere.
    - This high pressure to low-pressure air movement is called as ‘wind’.
    - The wind blows because of a pressure difference between the two such locations. 
    - Simply said, if there is a pressure difference, horizontally or near horizontally, between two locations, then wind will blow between such two places. 
    - Vertical movement of air is called as draft (updraft: air going up, or downdraft).
    - Drafts are not only because of pressure but mainly due to gravity and buoyancy. 
    - The pressure difference tells us the direction of the winds.

**Pressure Gradient and the related wind speed and wind strength:**

- - Gradient is the rate of change of a given thing between two locations. 
    - Hence, the Pressure gradient is the rate of change of pressure between two locations per unit distance. 
    - It is generally seen, more the gradient faster or stronger winds flows/moves from higher to lower value.
    - Hence, understanding the rule of pressure gradient, that higher the gradient will cause faster movement from high point to low point.

##### Factors which affect the wind:

- - In wind movement there are two parts:
    - Motion/drive of the wind, which causes movement or motion. (Pressure gradient is the driving force of the wind).
    - Steering force: which causes the direction of the wind.(imagine in 3-D)
    - There are three steering forces: 
        - Coriolis Force,
        - Frictional Force
        - Centripetal force: Inward during circular motion. Centrifugal Force: Outward during circular motion. Hence, they cancel each other. 

###### _Coriolis Force_

[The Coriolis Effect Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIyBpi7B-dE)

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 20.jpeg>)

- - **Merry-go-round observation:** 
    - When merry-go-round is rotating clockwise, the ball seems to deflect towards ‘left’.
    - From the North Pole, the earth looks like rotating Anti-Clockwise (objects will seem to deflect to right).
    - From the South Pole, the earth looks like rotating Clockwise (objects will seem to deflect to left).
    - The Coriolis Force hence is a pseudo-force, which seems to deflect long-distance traveling objects, such as winds, ocean currents, airplanes, rockets, missiles, etc., toward the right in North Hemisphere, and towards the left in the Southern Hemisphere.
    - The deflection is zero at the equator, and the maximum deflection is towards the pole. (speed से समझो)
    - Higher the latitude, the more the deflection.
    - If latitude is zero, deflection is also zero.
    - Earth’s rotation is the cause of the Coriolis Force.
    - The more the wind speed, the more will be the Coriolis Force will seem to be.
    - Coriolis force does not change with the movement of sun, it is related with the rotation of earth.

###### _Frictional force:_

- - The frictional force is due to the friction provided to moving objects by Earth’s surface such as land, ocean water, etc.
    - For example, friction to the land and ocean surface. 
    - The friction tends to slow down the speed of the object.
    - More the friction, slower the movement of the object.
    - Hence, the slower the object, the lesser the deflection.
    - More the friction: implies lesser the speed, lesser the speed implies lesser the deflection, and lesser the deflection implies lesser the Coriolis Force.
    - So if we compare, frictional force and Coriolis force tend to oppose each other.
    - Finally, frictional force opposes Coriolis force.
    - Frictional force seems to deflect opposite to Coriolis force.
    - Hence reducing the net deflection.
    - There is no frictional force in the upper troposphere for winds. Because wind cannot give friction to the wind.

#### _Winds on Earth:_

**Winds on the Non-rotating earth**: 

- - On non-rotating earth, there will be a single blanket of air from the poles to the equator.
    - Having low at the equator and high at the pole. 
    - As we see, if the earth was non-rotating, each hemisphere of the earth, N/S, we will get one vertical cell of the air movement rising at the equator and sinking at the pole.
    - But in reality, the earth is rotating.
    - And hence, a more complex formation takes place as discussed below:

**Wind movement on rotating earth:**

- - Coriolis force will act right/left of the moving object. (so In turn would create a circular movement of wind.)

**Formation of Geostrophic wind in the upper atmosphere:**

- - Geostrophic winds are created in the upper atmosphere
    - They move west to east, going round the earth, nearly parallel, and above certain latitudes, e.g. the one that is formed over 30 degrees latitude in both the hemispheres.
    - Similar geostrophic winds are formed above 60 degrees latitude by some complex phenomenon beyond our syllabus.
    - Geostrophic winds help us better understand the wind movement on the rotating earth.

**Tricellular Circulation:**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 37.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 38.png>)

- - As we see, that three cells are created in the atmosphere, the Hadley(0-30 degree), Ferrel(30-60) and Polar(60-90) Cells.
    - This is known as the three cell model or tricellular model which explains the movement in the atmosphere.
    - Due to the tricellular model, as understood above, we get seven pressure regions over the Earth's surface parallel to the latitudes, known as pressure belts.
    - Direction of wind patterns in northern hemisphere is clockwise, whereas in southern hemisphere it is counter clockwise.
    - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 1.gif>)

#### _Pressure Belts:_

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 39.png>)

- - These are: 
        - Belt 1: Equatorial low pressure, Spreading: 10 degrees N/S,
        - Belts 2 and 3: Subtropical High-pressure belts one in each hemisphere formed over 30 degrees, spreading: (from 23.5 to 35 degrees) N and S.
        - Belts 4 and 5: Sub Polar Low-pressure belt: Formed over 60-degree latitude (N/S), spreading between 45 to 66.5 degrees (N/S)
        - Belt 6 and 7: Polar High-Pressure Belts (one each on both poles, above 90 degrees, spreading up to 75-80 degrees latitude).
    - As we see, between the Seven Pressure Belts on the earth, a set of 3 winds blow in each hemisphere, between the high-pressure and low-pressure belts, and also affected by the Coriolis force, which tends to bend them as shown.
    - These three set of winds blow globally generally between 0-30 degrees, 30 and 60 degrees and 60 and 90 degrees.
    - Hence, they are also known as global surface winds or global winds.

**The naming of winds:**

- - The rule for the naming of winds is : they are named on the basis of the direction from which they come.
    - The naming of winds is done on the basis of the direction from which they are coming from.
    - E.g. Wind coming from the west will be called as westerly.
    - Winds between 0 to 30 are called as easterly winds.
    - The 30-60 N/S: the winds are called as westerly winds.
    - The 60-90 N/S: the winds are called as easterly winds.
    - Westerly of Northern Hemisphere is called South Westerly.
    - Westerly of South Hemisphere is called as North Westerly. And so on.

**Breaking of Pressure Belts:**

- - **Summer effect on the pressure Belt:**
        - In the month of June, when summer is there in NH, how these pressure belts are broken, is as given below: 
        - In summer, in the equatorial region, it will be hot only over the ocean or the continent, supporting the equatorial low-pressure belt created thermally.
        - In the summers, in polar regions, it remains extremely cold only, supporting the thermally created polar high-pressure belt, both over the ocean and continents.
        - Simply said, during summer, the polar high-pressure belt remains the same, both over the ocean and continents.
        - The sub-polar region does become slightly warm during summer and hence this thermal warm condition supports the mechanical low pressure, in this region.
        - Hence, the sub-polar low-pressure belt is also not adversely affected during the summer season.
        - The subtropical high-pressure regions, become hot during summers.
        - The continental regions become very hot, creating thermal low-pressure conditions over the continent, which oppose the mechanical high-pressure condition in this region.
        - _If the thermal low-pressure is very strong, it rather breaks the subtropical high-pressure belt over the continent, creating a local sub-tropical low-pressure cell over the continent._
        - _Over the oceans of sub-tropical regions, the temperature is not very hot, hence very strong low-pressure cells are not created there._
        - Hence, though, the broken parts of subtropical high-pressure belts now called cells, though weakened, still remain over the oceans as high-pressure cells.

- - **Winter effect on Pressure Belts:**
        - In the winter season, the equatorial region remains hot, over ocean and land, so the equatorial low-pressure belt continues, both over ocean and land.
        - The polar region becomes very cold, strengthening the polar high-pressure belt.
        - The sub-tropical region also becomes cold, hence creating, thermal high-pressure, which supports the subtropical high-pressure belt. 
        - Sub-Polar regions become extremely cold, especially over the continent, hence creating extremely cold High-pressure conditions over the continent, which opposes and hence breaks the sub-polar low-pressure belts only over continents. Though over oceans, they are weakened but not broken.
        - Hence, broken parts of the sub-polar belt, become sub-polar low-pressure cells over oceans, whereas, on continents, a sub-polar high-pressure cell is created.

**Effect of breaking of Pressure cells:**

- - In the summer over the continent, we have the sub-polar low-pressure belt and subtropical low-pressure cell, hence the pressure difference becomes less, hence westerly becomes weak.
    - In the winter season, over the continent, the sub-tropical region has a high-pressure belt, and the sub-polar region has a low-pressure cell.
    - Hence, the pressure difference between these two regions becomes, hence westerlies are again weakened over the continents in winters.
    - Hence westerlies are generally weak over the continent, they are strong only over the oceans.

**Shifting of Pressure Belts:**

- - We know that around the year, the sun apparently shifts from Tropic of Capricorn around December to equator around March, and Tropic of Cancer around June, and then again returns back to equator around September, further going toward Tropic of Capricorn towards December, completing one cycle of the year.
    - Hence we see, that for six months the sun keeps shifting Northwards from the Tropic of the Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer, and the subsequent six months shifts southwards from the Tropic of Cancer to Tropic of Capricorn.
    - We also know, that the equatorial low-pressure belt is created around the equator, when we consider the sun’s position over the equator.
    - And the subtropical and subpolar pressure belts are subsequently created between equatorial low and polar high.
    - Hence simply said, the sub-tropical and sub-polar pressure belts are created indirectly due to the equatorial low-pressure belt, polar high-pressure belt, the Earth’s rotation and the resultant global winds.
    - But because the sun keeps shifting round the year, hence it does not always remain over equator, and hence the equatorial low-pressure belt does not always remain over the equator.
    - Rather, the equatorial low-pressure belt keeps shifting, along with the shifting of the sun.
    - Hence, as the sun shifts towards the Tropic of Cancer, the equatorial low-pressure belt tries to follow it.
    - Though, the pressure belt shifting is not by 231/2 degrees, and rather the pressure-belt shifts only by 5-10 degrees maximum.
    - Hence, the equatorial low-pressure belt is around the equator during March and September. From March to June it shifts towards the Tropic of Cancer (by 5 to 10 degrees).
    - From June to September, it shifts back towards the equator, from September to December, it shifts towards the tropic of Capricorn by 5-10 degrees.
    - And December to March shifts back towards the equator. 
    - A very important point is that as the equatorial low-pressure belt shifts in one direction, because the other pressure belts are also related to equatorial pressure belts( subtropical and sub polar ), hence they also shift in the same direction(5-10 degrees max).
    - Hence, as we see, in the pressure-belt shifting diagram, that all the three pressure belts, Equatorial Low (EL), Sub Tropical High, and Sub Polar Low, shift with the shifting of the sun.
    - Because, we know that, the global winds tropical easterlies, westerlies, and polar easterlies, are created between two subsequent pressure belts, hence, we can also understand, that as the pressure belt shift, the global winds will also shift.

**Effects of the wind shifting:**

- - Hence the shifting of global winds with the shifting of pressure-belts though does not affect the regions in the middle of the wind belts but the regions on the edge of the wind belts or the pressure belt regions, as the pressure and wind belt shifts, such regions also experience different global winds, during different parts of the year.
    - For example, at 30 degrees North latitude, during June, when the wind-belts have shifted northwards, the North East trade winds(tropical easterlies) will blow.
    - Six months later in December, when wind belts have shifted maximum southwards, by (5-10 degrees) then South Westerlies will blow.
    - Hence, we can conclude that most places on the earth get same global winds around the year (places well inside the wind belts, but few places experience changing global winds with the shifting of pressure belts, because these few places, are located around 30 degrees and 60 degree latitudes, and hence, the pressure belts and related global winds shift across the them)

**Rossby Waves and Jet Streams**

- - These are part of winds in the upper atmosphere.
    - Will be covered later.
    - Surface global winds are called as ‘Primary Winds’.

**Flow of the winds:**

- - Similar to the flow of the river (which has a unidirectional flow of water round the year).
    - Within this unidirectional flow, we also get to see, some whirlpool type of movements.
    - The whirlpool also flows with the river, as a part of river, they are neither very big, nor very small. 
    - There are further smaller flows in the river, which are the third level of flow in the river, like the water going up-down a stone or rock in the river, or water narrowing between two rocks in a river.
    - Third flow: These are the smaller local flows in the river.
    - Similarly, the winds being fluid, like water also create 3 levels of flow, over the earth.
        - First: The Primary Winds, which are like the rivers themselves, also called ‘global winds’.
        - Second: The Atmospheric Whirlpools, which are the secondary winds, which are the one example of secondary winds, or second type of circulation, taking place within the global winds
        - Third: The Tertiary Winds (also called the Local Winds): Which are the third level of flow, like the water around the rocks in the river.
    - The monsoon winds in India, which are seasonal are also an example of Secondary winds.
    - Hence secondary winds are also called as seasonal winds.

##### Primary Winds

**Tropical Easterlies Characteristics:**

- - They are mostly driven by the more fundamental equatorial low-pressure belts, and hence generally they are strong global winds. Blowing nearly round the year, between nearly 10-30 degrees latitude (tropical region).
    - Here they are known as trade winds, because earlier traders used to sail, using these strong constant winds round the year.
    - They have good moisture-holding capacity because they are warm/hot.
    - Between 0 to 10 degrees, as they horizontally converge to rise vertically, hence at the equatorial region, we have very less winds (as winds are vertically rising Equatorial Low Pressure). Hence this region is also known as Doldrums (very less wind, due to low pressure).
    - This 0 to 10 degrees N/S is called as Equatorial region.
    - 30 to 10 degrees N/S region is called a Tropical region.

**Westerly Wind Characteristics:**

- - They are relatively stronger in the Southern Hemisphere because there is more oceanic region.
    - On continents, the westerlies are weak (Northern Hemisphere).
    - Westerlies in Southern Hemisphere are called by different names:
        - Roaring Forties (40 degrees South)
        - Furious Fifties (50 degrees South)
        - Shrieking Sixties (60 degrees South).
    - And westerlies are more parallel to latitudes in Southern Hemisphere because they are very strong.
    - Westerlies are weak and variable winds in Northern Hemisphere over the Continents.
    - Westerlies carry heat from the sub-tropical region (35 degrees to 23.5 degrees), to the mid-latitude (30-60 degrees N) regions and sub-polar regions (around 60 degrees).
    - Westerlies start from Sub-tropical high-pressure belts, and it is generally known that low-pressure regions have strong winds, and high-pressure regions have weak winds.
    - Hence, the sub-tropical high-pressure regions generally have very weak winds. And hence are known as Horse Latitudes (30 latitudes).

**Polar Easterlies**

- - Polar Easterlies are also strong because they start from the thermal polar high-pressure belts.
    - And they carry the colder winds from polar to sub-polar regions, which get warmed in the sub-polar regions.

##### Tertiary Winds (Local Winds)

- - Land and Sea Breeze:
        - Sea Breeze blows during the late afternoon, from sea to land.
        - Land Breeze blows during early morning from land to sea.
    - Valley Breeze and Mountain Breeze:
        - Valley breeze takes place during the daytime, the Mountain breeze takes place during night.
        - Valley breeze causes rains, during day. Known as Anabatic (warming) winds.
        - Mountain breeze blows during night, temperature inversion type condition. Known as Katabatic (cooling winds).
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 40.png>)
    - The third type of winds are the warm and the cold local winds.

**Local Warm Winds:** 

- - Loo blows in North India.
    - Fohn: Germany
    - Chinook: Rocky Mountains/North America
    - Sirocco (also Khamsin or Gibli) : North Africa and Mediterranean
    - Harmattan (also the Doctor winds): Western Africa.
    - Santa Ana: California region in USA.
    - Zonda: South America.

**Local Cold Winds:**

- - Sheet Lahar (India)
    - Mistral in Europe (Spain / France region)
    - Bora wind: East of Italy in the Mediterranean
    - Blizzard in the United States (very violent cold wind), in Russia it is called as Buran or Purga.
    - Pompero in South America
    - Southern Busters: in Australia.

### Humidity

- - It is basically the wetness and dampness in the air that we generally feel.
    - Humidity is measured using a Hygrometer.
    - Three types of humidity that we talk about are:

**Absolute humidity:**

- - The measure of actual amount of water vapour present in the air. Here the water vapour is measured in grams and the air we take a unit volume 1 meter cube. Simply said grams of water vapour present in one meter cube is absolute humidity.
    - Absolute humidity tells us how much water vapour is present in the air.
    - Here it should be noted that amount of water vapour present depends on the availability of water sources, e.g. surface water, river water, ocean or soil moisture, etc.
    - The moisture-holding capacity of the air depends on the temperature as the higher the temperature, the more the moisture-holding capacity.
    - But if availability is not there, then capacity does not matter much.

**Relative humidity:**

- - Relative humidity is the ratio, of the actual amount of water vapour present to the maximum amount of water vapour that air can hold at the given temperature.
    - For example, if at 30 degree temperature the maximum possible capacity to hold moisture is 50 grams/volume but in actual air has only 30 grams of water vapour then the RH of such air will be 30gm/50gm i.e. 60% of the capacity.
    - So we say such air has 60% relative humidity.
    - **Dew Point**: If the relative humidity at a given temperature becomes 100%, then we say that the air is saturated with moisture and it can no more hold any moisture.
    - If any excess moisture is present at such temperature, as water vapour, it starts to condense into due.
    - Hence, saturation is also known as Dew Point, because at such temperature, dew formation begins.
    - Moist air, which at a relatively higher temperature is relatively not saturated, can get saturated by gradual cooling. And the temperature where it gets saturated will be called dew point.
    - Any further cooling of air leads to further condensation. 
    - Relative humidity tells us what is the possibility of condensation in the air, as more the relative humidity, the more the possibility of condensation.
    - Specific humidity :- Specific humidity is a measure of the weight of water vapour present per unit weight of air.

**Condensation:**

- - Condensation is gas turning to liquid, due to cooling, hence releasing the heat.
    - Conditions for condensation:
        - It requires cold conditions (either a cold surface, or cold air). Below dew point.
        - It requires a solid surface (either a solid cold surface, e.g. bottle, ground, grass, or it requires dust particles, i.e. hygroscopic particles).

**Results of Condensation:**

- - Dew and frost happen Dew on grass/ground in liquid conditions, frost is solid.
    - In Air: 
        - In the troposphere (upper atmosphere): We get clouds.  
        - In lower atmosphere (near the ground): We get fog and mist.

### Clouds 

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 42.png>)

- - Clouds are a huge bunch of small condensed droplets around hygroscopic particles also called condensation nuclei, in the upper atmosphere.
    - Because they are in the upper atmosphere, hence the height of the cloud is their first basis of classification. 
    - Clouds generally have two parts to their names.
    - Where the first part generally tells their height.
    - The second part of the name will give them their expanse or raininess.

- - Height: Cirrus, Alto, Stratus.
    - Expanse: If they are horizontal in continuous layer - stratus, if the cloud is not continuous, in small spaces, it is called a cumulus.
    - The Raininess of a cloud is referred to by: Nimbus.
    - Above the troposphere we have two more clouds: 
    - Polar stratospheric cloud found just above the tropopause, above poles. They have some role in Ozone hole formation.  
    - They are also related to the Polar Vertex phenomenon.
    - Noctilucent Cloud: These are the clouds in the Mesosphere, generally over the pole, and they shine in the night.

**Characteristics of Clouds**

- - Horizontal clouds cause relatively slower rains.
    - Whereas the vertical clouds, which are like vertical water tanks, cause relatively more intense rain, like the Cumulonimbus Clouds.
    - The altitude of clouds also affects the precipitation from the clouds.
    - For example, we know that we have clouds at high altitudes as well as at low altitudes.
    - For incoming solar radiation, the low clouds are the last barrier, hence more low clouds mean, more reflection of insolation.
    - Hence lesser insolation will come to the surface of earth, and hence the heating of the lower troposphere, where we live will be less.
    - Hence, simply said, more amount of low clouds will mean, the earth will be heated less.
    - More clouds mean less heating of the earth, has an overall cooling effect on the earth.
    - More higher clouds act as the last barrier for outgoing terrestrial radiation, and more amount of high cloud means, terrestrial radiation will be reflected back toward the earth, hence warming the earth surface/region where we live.
    - Hence, simply said, more amount of high clouds like cirrus clouds mean, more warming of the earth.

**Sun's Halo**

- - 22-degree ring that appears due to the dispersion of light passes through ice crystals found in upper-level cirrus clouds, cause the sun's halo to have colours.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 22.jpeg>)

#### _Precipitation:_

- - Precipitation in simple English means settling down of suspended particles.
    - Hence, precipitation in the atmosphere simply means settling down of suspended water droplets in the atmosphere.
    - Here the water droplets are suspended, as clouds.
    - Like the ones we read above.
    - These water droplets are formed around small condensation nuclei, forming small water droplets, which form the cloud, and remain suspended as clouds, because they are too small and light in weight.
    - The precipitation here happens when bigger hygroscopic particles or condensation nuclei reach the upper troposphere due to some specific processes. 
    - In the cloud, around these bigger hygroscopic particles, bigger droplets tend to form.
    - As smaller droplets accumulate around these bigger hygroscopic particles.
    - Hence, these bigger water droplets become heavy enough so as to fall down as precipitation.
    - These bigger drops are what we call as raindrops.
    - Hence this is how rain forms from clouds.
    - When the bigger droplets are formed around bigger condensation nuclei, as the smaller droplets in the cloud accumulate around bigger condensation nuclei, due to more weight, the bigger droplets precipitate towards the ground.
    - This is how rain as precipitation takes place.
    - But rain is not the only form of precipitation, as we also know about other forms, such as sleet, hail, and snow.
    - The other forms of precipitation are as explained below:

**Sleet(ओले) formation:**

- - We should have a layer of very cold (freezing zone) region below the cloud.
    - When rain passes through this region, it will turn into frozen water balls, this is how sleet is formed.
    - Below the clouds, for example extremely cold air from mountains.
    - When the droplets pass through such regions, they freeze into ice balls, known as sleet.
    - After formation, sleet will fall (small spherical ice).

**Hail(बड़े भारी ओले) Formation:**

- - Hail formation also starts similar to sleet formation, but in addition to sleet forming conditions, some additional conditions are also there, such as rising convections, which could be a mechanically rising convection or thermally caused convections.
    - The convections tend to carry back the frozen sleet-like droplets back into the clouds where more water accumulates around the sleet-like frozen balls, and again these bigger size balls fall back through the freezing zone and hence refreeze, forming bigger frozen balls.
    - If the convection is strong enough, and hence the freezing balls are carried back and forth a few times, it can lead to the frozen balls becoming bigger and bigger.
    - Ultimately, causing them to precipitate back on the ground as hail.
    - Hail might form in hilly areas or even in plains and can also form during summers, due to thermal convection.
    - For example, hail forms in India even during summers in regions such as Jharkhand, Odisha, UP, Bihar.

**Snow Formation**

- - Snow formation takes place in region where the cloud itself, is in a subfreezing zone.
    - Like in temperate regions in winter or polar regions, or on the mountain top in tropical regions.
    - Snow or snowflakes grow around hygroscopic particles by freezing of small droplets in the clouds.
    - As the flakes become bigger they become heavy enough to slowly fall down.
    - And that is exactly how snowflakes form and fall down.
    - These are the forms of precipitation for snowflakes.

- - For these precipitations to take place there are processes leading to precipitation or rainfall.
    - Requirements for precipitation: Small droplets, large condensation nuclei, temperature (above freezing: rain, below freezing: sleet, hail).
    - Normally large condensation nuclei, are present near earth's surface. And not in the upper troposphere.
    - This is why not everywhere we get precipitation happening always.
    - Precipitation takes place only when:
        - There are clouds - suspended water particles on small hygroscopic nuclei.
        - Large condensation nuclei reach those clouds.
    - Hence, the more important condition is how large condensation nuclei reach the cloud.
    - Hence the processes causing the large condensation nuclei to reach the cloud are rising air processes, which carry such particles with them.
    - Such as: 
        - Convectional rise of air (heated, thermal convectional rise).
        - Orographic (mountain) rise.
        - Cyclonic rise: Frontal cyclonic and tropical cyclonic rise.
    - Just clouds themselves cannot cause rain.

**Convectional Rise:**

- - Due to rising air in hot conditions gradually cloud formation and further precipitation might take place.
    - Also leading to cumulonimbus cloud formation. 

**Orographic Rise:** 

- - Rising winds over mountain slopes cause orographic precipitation.
    - This causes rains in the mountain.

Cyclonic precipitation will be explained while explaining cyclones. 

##### Major regions of precipitation in the world: 

- - Normally precipitation decreases as we go from the equator towards the pole.
    - It also decreases when we go from coastal regions to the interior of continents.
    - On continents, it decreases from east to west,  between 0 to 30-35 degrees latitude over the continents.(winds)
    - And in 35 to 65 degrees latitude, it decreases when we go from west to east.(winds)
    - Earth has been divided into major precipitation zones on the basis of amount of rainfall. Here it should be noted, that the global average precipitation is around 100 cm annually. 
    - In India it is 125 cm.

**Par Humid Regions: (more than 200 cm annually)**

- - Hence regions receiving more than 200 cm annually, are known as par humid regions.
    - This includes:
        - A: Equatorial Belt.
        - B: Coastal monsoon regions.
        - C: The windward slopes of mountains in westerlies wind regions.

**Humid Regions (100-200 cm annually):**

- - A: Continental coastal region.
    - B: Windward sides of interior continents.

**Semi-Arid Regions (50-100 cm annually):** 

- - A: Interior tropical regions.
    - B: Interior temperate regions
    - C: Western tropical and eastern temperate regions.

**Arid Regions (less than 50 cm annually).** 

- - A: Tropical Deserts (western sides of continents).
    - B: Rainshadow/Leeward side of mountains.
    - C: Polar regions.

##### Sunshine

- - The same factors which affect the insolation, affect the sunshine.
    - And hence, tropical regions have more sunshine, because they have mechanical high pressure (descending winds, hence clear skies). 
    - Equatorial regions have low-pressure and hence clouds, hence slightly lesser sunshine than tropical regions.
    - Further, as we go poleward, sunshine decreases in intensity, because it becomes inclined. 

##### Visibility

- - Visibility is affected both in dry and humid regions.
    - In dry regions (less than 75% RH), we generally get haze, which is dusty condition, too much of dust in the air, which reduces visibility to less than 2 km. such as sandy dust storms in deserts, which makes the air hazy.
    - In humid regions (about 95% RH), we get two kinds of low visibility conditions, such as mist and fog.
    - Mist and fog form similarly, and they are like clouds near the ground.
    - But mist has fewer and bigger droplets with visibility around 1000 metres.
    - Fog has numerous smaller droplets and visibility might be as less as few metres.
    - Fog is like dense clouds.

## Cyclone

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 44.png>)

**How winds move in cyclonic conditions:**

- - Cyclonic conditions develop over low-pressure conditions.
    - These are absolute low-pressure conditions.
    - Low-pressure conditions: Horizontal inward wind starts to blow.
    - Lower the low pressure, stronger and faster will be the winds.
    - If wind speed is below 31kmph, we call it low.
    - If the wind becomes 31km - 49 kmph, we start calling it depression.
    - If wind speed is 49 - 62 kmph, we call it as deep depression.
    - If the wind speed becomes 63 - 88 kmph, we start calling it as a cyclone.
    - Severe Cyclone: 89 -117 kmph (wind speed).
    - Very Severe Cyclone: 118-165 kmph (wind speed).
    - Extremely Severe Cyclone: 166-220 kmph (wind speed).
    - Super Severe Cyclone: more than 220 kmph (wind speed).

**For cyclones, the other conditions which need to be fulfilled are:**

- - A regional low-pressure condition.
    - When we see, in reality the high and low pressures on the earth, we find that certain regions have high pressure, and certain regions have low pressure. And as we go away around them, we find that circular or some non-uniform isobars formed around them.
    - And wind tend to flow from high to low-pressure regions.
    - Hence in reality, we get circular or near-circular isobars, hence for cyclones also, circular or near-circular isobars are needed.
    - The other conditions of cyclones are:
    - Inward spiralling winds horizontally, around the low-pressure centre, having required minimum speed, which moves vertically outwards.
    - The opposite condition of this with wind vertically inwards, and spiralling horizontally outwards slowly, around a high-pressure condition is called as anti-cyclonic conditions.
    - How does wind spiral around circular isobars?
    - For tropical cyclones, in the northern hemisphere, we find that the wind moves anti-clockwise spiralling inwards horizontally.
    - High-pressure anticyclone: Horizontally spiralling outward, clockwise.  

**WINDS FLOW IN CYCLONIC AND ANTI-CYCLONIC CONDITIONS**

- - Around low-pressure centres, with near-circular isobars, cyclonic conditions are created with horizontally inward spiralling winds, and around high-pressure centres, with circular isobars, anti-cyclonic conditions are created with horizontally outwards spiralling winds, over the whole earth.
    - Direction for spiralling in the two hemispheres(clockwise or anti-clockwise) is decided by the overall effect of Coriolis force as discussed below.

- - **Northern hemisphere condition-**
        - As we have seen in the diagram of northern hemisphere cyclonic winds due to low-pressure gradient force is radially inward hence initially winds try to move inwards. As the Coriolis in the northern hemisphere acts towards the right as inwards coming wind also try to bend towards the right, and because of pressure gradient force and Coriolis force the northern hemisphere winds around the low-pressure centre move anti-clockwise and circular
        - Due to the additional effect of frictional force acting opposite to Coriolis force and hence in the direction of Pressure Gradient Force, finally, the winds spiralling inwards towards the low-pressure centre
        - Hence, simply said finally we find that the wind due to PGF, Coriolis force and frictional force is spiralling inwards anti-clockwise around the low-pressure centre in the northern hemisphere.
        - In The Anti-cyclonic HP condition in Northern Hemisphere, the PGF is acting outward the wind also tries to go radially outward. The Coriolis force acting right to the wind finally acts opposite to the PGF and hence the wind starts moving circular around the High-pressure centre due to PGF and Coriolis force.
        - As the Frictional force acts opposite to the Coriolis force and hence in the direction of PGF so the wind starts finally spiralling outwards.
        - Hence, simply said through the PGF and Coriolis force and friction force finally the wind moves spiralling outwards around HP centre in the Northern hemisphere creating the anti-cyclonic condition.

- - **Southern Hemisphere condition-**
        - In the southern hemisphere due to the leftward direction of Coriolis force clockwise and anti-clockwise direction of cyclonic and anticyclonic condition in the southern hemisphere.
        - So simply said cyclonic winds in the southern hemisphere are clockwise and anti-cyclonic winds are anti-clockwise
        - These conditions prevail for the cyclonic and anticyclonic condition of the tropic, temperate or polar region.

##### PRIMARY UPPER ATMOSPHERIC WINDS

**GEO-STROPHIC WINDS**

- - Are generally created below the tropopause above 30 degree and 60 degrees latitude in general. But there are certain more conditions creating geostrophic winds which move west-east. These winds through moving nearly parallel to the latitude in the upper atmosphere but are not strictly parallel. As they move slightly wave-like shifting poleward and equatorward like away as they broadly move west to east.
    - These west to east geostrophic winds moving wave-like are called Rossby waves
    - Rossby waves are wide horizontally spreading over a few degrees latitude and thousand km wide and most of the wind in Rossby waves moving relatively slow

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 23.jpeg>)

**JET STREAM**

- - They are type of geostrophic wind, strongest where the pressure gradient is highest
    - Are generally formed within the Rossby waves and are horizontally narrower up to 100-150 km wide vertically 2-3 km depth but having high wind speeds of 100km/hr to more than 300 km/hr
    - Jet streams are formed below the tropopause between the primary atmospheric cells generally. But few jet streams are also formed elsewhere
    - Jet streams are formed due to High temperature and pressure gradient in the upper atmosphere. The major jet stream of importance to us are
        - Polar night jet stream-during night (which means winters) of poles and hence they are formed only for 6 months. The polar night jet stream plays a role in the formation of the polar vortex, polar stratospheric clouds. Move west to east.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 46.png>)
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 47.png>)

- - Polar frontal Jet Stream - also called a Polar jet stream. This is formed above 60-degree latitude between the polar cell or Ferrel cell below the tropopause over the polar front. With the shifting of sun and polar and Ferrel cells, this jet stream also shifts between 30-70 degree latitudes. They blow at a height of 9 to 12 km, are related to the polar front formation with wind speeds of 100-300km/hr. moving west to east.
    - The sub-Tropical westerly jet stream - formed over the subtropic HP belt and below the tropopause over the sub-tropical front. This jet stream also keeps shifting btw 20-35 degrees latitude with the shifting of the sun and the pressure belts. Subtropical westerly jet stream formed at a height of 10-14 km. moving at a speed of 300km/hr. Moving west to east. They also play a role in bringing temperate cyclones called western disturbances in India
    - The tropical easterly jet stream - is a seasonal jet stream blowing only during June-sept in the northern hemisphere over the Indian subcontinent and Indian ocean between 8 degrees to 30 degrees north latitude at a height of 14-16 km. The wind speeds are around 100 km/hr. The tropical easterly jet stream is responsible for the summer monsoon over India. They also play a role in bringing tropical depressions and tropical cyclones into India and hence causing rainfall.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 48.png>)

- - Somali Jet stream - important for Indian perspective. Moving in middle atmosphere from Somalian coast towards India pushing the south-west monsoon winds towards Indian and hence enhancing monsoon rains over India

**POLAR VERTEX**

- - During the polar night, polar night jet stream is formed just below the tropopause
    - Jet streams from the beginning of winters trap the upper atmospheric air within the jet streams
    - This trapped air becomes cold or extremely cold over the winter period and leads to the formation of extremely cold clouds which sometimes extend even above the tropopause into the stratosphere known as polar stratospheric clouds
    - These clouds play a role in ozone depletion and creating ozone holes over poles
    - Extremely cold air trapped btw the circling jet stream moves like a vortex in the upper atmosphere and technically this is the polar vortex.
    - As the winters end and the polar night jet stream weakens the polar vortex air which is extremely cold starts to descend to lower altitudes and spread to lower latitudes.
    - These are extremely cold storm like winds that are experienced in the subpolar region and high latitude temperate region by end of winters and this phenomenon is known as polar vortex during this period.

### TEMPERATE CYCLONES AND CONCEPTS

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 51.png>)

##### AIR MASSES AND FRONTS

- - Temperate cyclones are also known as an extratropical cyclone, frontal cyclone, mid-latitude cyclone
    - 40-60 degree cyclone.
    - Are formed over the front region (within the warm front and cold front)
    - such fronts are formed between air masses having contrasting temperature conditions (COLD AIRMASS AND WARM AIRMASS)

##### AIRMASS -

- - Airmass is a huge Parcel of air above the surface of earth and extending through the troposphere
    - It has a wide latitudinal extent spreading over 100km or 1000km.
    - One given airmass would generally have horizontally uniform pressure and temperature condition whereas vertically and throughout the airmass it would have humidity condition
    - Hence, simply said throughout the given air mass there is uniformity of temperature and pressure condition horizontally and also uniformity of humidity in general.
    - We will focus on Hot and cold air masses. Two Adjacent airmasses are called hot or cold on the basis of their relative temperatures.
    - It is also known that airmasses over oceans are relatively more humid and once over interior continents are relatively drier or less humid airmass.

**DIFFERENT MAJOR AIR MASSES**

- - On the basis of latitudes we have 3 airmass -

a)The Arctic and Antarctic airmass

b)Polar Airmass

c)Tropical Airmass

- - Accordingly, following types of airmasses are recognised:

Maritime tropical (mT)

Continental tropical (cT)

Maritime polar (mP)

Continental polar (cP)

Continental arctic (cA)

##### FRONT

- - A front is a narrow region separating one air mass from the other air mass. Hence, generally on the two sides of the front, the temperature, pressure and humidity condition will be different
    - A front is called the strong front if the air masses on the two sides have a very distinct character. For ex. one is much cold or the other is much warm
    - On the other hand, a front is called as the weak front if the two air masses on the two sides of the front have very similar kind of characteristics like both are having cold air mass or both are warm airmass
    - Hence, generally across a distinct front, the temperature and hence the pressure gradient is high
    - But it should also be noted that if the air masses are very distinct in terms of temperature and humidity then do not easily mix with each other

**CLASSIFICATION OF FRONT**

- - ON THE BASIS OF AIRMASS - STRONG FRONT (DISTINCT & CONTRASTING AIRMASS) AND WEAK (SIMILAR AIRMASS)
    - ON THE BASIS OF MOVEMENT OF AIRMASS - STATIONARY FRONT; WARM FRONT; COLD FRONT; OCCLUDED FRONT
    - As we see in the stationary front diagram - because the air masses do not push into each other hence the front between these airmasses does not move either poleward or equatorward and hence remains stationary. hence we called as a **stationary front.**
    - But we also know for example that between the polar cell and Ferrel cell in the upper atmosphere below the tropopause we have a polar front jet stream and we have seen that these jet streams move wave-like or Rossby waves making poleward /equatorward waves and some regions moving clockwise (HP) and other region moving anti-clockwise (LP)
    - Hence mechanically in the upper atmosphere polar front jet stream make HP and LP regions.
    - So, wherever we have HP in the upper atmosphere then we gave corresponding LP on the earth surface and vice-versa

**Warm and Cold Fronts:**

- - As seen in the figures for warm fronts and cold fronts, we find, that, when Jet Streams, like Polar front jet streams, are moving over the stationary polar fronts, between polar cell and Ferrell cell, below the tropopause, these Jet Streams, as they move wavelike, between North and South Sides, at some locations they create anti-clockwise movement, whereas at others they create clockwise movements. 
    - These upper atmospheric anti-clockwise and clockwise movements create upper atmosphere low pressure and high-pressure conditions respectively. 
    - And corresponding high pressure and low pressure on the surface of the earth.
    - Hence, wherein the upper atmosphere, where the polar jet stream creates anticyclonic conditions, on the surface of the earth, over the stationary front, creates cyclonic low-pressure conditions.
    - This leads to an anticlockwise wind movement around the low pressure. 
    - Due to this anticlockwise wind movement, on the eastern side of the stationary front, the warm air mass pushes the front towards the cold air mass, whereas, on the western side, of the stationary front, the cold airmass pushes the front towards the warm air mass.
    - Hence, warm and cold fronts are formed.
    - In respective figures we can see, how cold airmass if pushing the cold front into warm airmass, vertically.
    - A warm front cyclone is formed due to the rise of warmer winds when the warm front meets the cold air mass and rises.
    - Along a warm front, we have inward anticlockwise wind in the northern hemisphere. Further, we have seen that as the warm air mass pushes the colder airmass, hence it tends to rise along the warm front. 
    - Hence if the winds are strong, fast, and spiralling inward, with clouds and rains, then we call it as a temperate warm front cyclone. 

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 52.png>)

**Cold front cyclones:**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 53.png>)

- - As the cold air mass pushes into the warm airmass, around low pressure or due to the low pressure created along the front, we get spiralling inward winds.
    - As the cold front moves towards the warm air mass, shown in the cold front cyclone diagram, warm air accumulated along the cold front, being lighter, tends to rise. 
    - And hence form relatively vertical clouds like cumulonimbus clouds and precipitation.
    - Hence this way, we get strong spiralling inward winds, along with clouds and precipitation. 
    - And hence we call it the cold front cyclonic condition. Or simply cold front cyclone. 
    - Hence we have seen the formation of warm front cyclones as well as cold front cyclones. 
    - Temperate cyclones are formed in the mid-latitude region. (30 to 60 degrees), Their jet streams also move in the west to east direction.
    - And are also driven by the westerlies wind.
    - Temperate cyclones are always formed along fronts, they are formed along the polar fronts, which is between polar cell and Ferrell cell.
    - They are also formed along subtropical fronts, which is between Ferrell cell and Hadley cell, there it is driven by sub-tropical westerly winds.
    - Hence moving west to east.
    - They are formed over large areas and hence spread over thousand to two thousand kilometres. 
    - They originate or form over both land and sea.
    - And affect the weather condition in the mid-latitude. 
    - The wind velocity is less, around 30-60 km per hour, hence they are not destructive cyclones, rather they provide moisture to temperate region crops, and hence have a constructive role to play. They are also called a family of cyclones.
    - The beginning of the front formation, or when a stationary front is formed, is known as the frontogenesis.
    - And the beginning of the cyclone formation is known as cyclogenesis. 

**End of fronts, Frontolysis:**

- - When the warm front cyclones and the cold front cyclones are moving in a west to east direction, at that time, because, the cold air is denser, hence, it is able to push the warm air easily.
    - Hence, the cold front moves faster, at the same time, because, the warm air, being lighter cannot easily push the denser cold air, hence the warm front moves slower, gradually, therefore, the cold front is able to catch up with the warm front.
    - Or start overlapping. As the happens, we can see that near the earth’s surface, cold air mass accumulates on both sides of the overlapping fronts, hence, the front becomes weak, and gradually tends to end, known as the **occluded front.**
    - Which also leads to the end of front or Frontolysis. 
    - Occluded, dying front: No more distinct front, hence called as the occluded or dying front.
    - As the fronts end, the associated cold front cyclone and warm front cyclone also come to an end. 
    - And hence this way, the end of the cyclone takes place.

### Thermal Equator and ITCZ:

- - Zero-degree latitude is the geographical latitude of the earth.
    - We have another concept called ‘thermal equator’, as discussed.
    - Different longitudes on earth may have different maximum temperatures, when we connect all these places, using a line, it is known as ‘thermal equator’.
    - A thermal equator is a line connecting places having maximum temperature on the earth’s surface, during a day, week, month, or year.
    - The thermal equator is not the same as the geographical equator, and it normally lies between the tropics.
    - We generally get an equatorial low-pressure belt over the thermal equator, and as the day-to-day thermal equator keeps shifting, hence equatorial low-pressure belt also keeps shifting generally day to day.
    - At the equatorial low-pressure belt, the trade winds of the Northern and Southern hemispheres come and converge.
    - And because these locations of trade wind convergence, are generally within the tropics, hence we also call this zone of convergence of trade winds as Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
    - The ITCZ keeps shifting with the thermal equator, or with the sun, hence it normally remains in tropics, but over the Indian subcontinent, because the hottest places are not within the tropics, but slightly north of tropic, during Summer (June/July), hence, the ITCZ also shifts up to the northern end of northern plains.
    - During winter, they tend to move south, hence, ITCZ tends to move towards the Southern Hemisphere.
    - But even in January, the warmest temperatures in Southern Atlantic and Southern Eastern Pacific, are not in the southern hemisphere, but in the Northern Hemisphere. 
    - Mainly due to high continentality in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as the cold current effect along the western coast of South America, hence ITCZ does not shift to these regions round the year.

### Tropical Cyclones

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 56.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 57.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 58.png>)

- - Conditions for formation of tropical cyclones:
        - Not formed in Equatorial Regions (0-10 degrees N/S).
            - Coriolis Force is absent/weak near the equator.
        - Tropical cyclones are formed only over the oceans.
            - Because they pick heat by evaporating water from oceans.
    - They do not form over rivers or lakes, due to size requirements (they travel 600, 1200 km).
    - The temperature should be 27 degrees or more.
    - In the summer to the beginning of winter seasons, they are formed, because such ocean conditions are available.
    - At the end of summer, the temperature of the ocean is maximum. E.g. in the Indian context, maximum tropical cyclones occur during October-November and May and June.
    - They do not form in India during June, July (due to monsoon season).
    - They are getting the pre-existing low pressure by ITCZ. 
    - Due to the presence of additional low pressure over the warm ocean surface, due to Coriolis Force, they tend to spiral inwards and pick moisture from the ocean.
    - They also pick enough heat during evaporation.
    - But it is hot summer season, hence, the ocean surface water has enough heat, and hence it does not get cooled easily.
    - Hence simply said, for a few days, the ocean is able to continuously provide moisture and heat by evaporation.
    - As the wind spiral in and vertically out, condensation takes place leading to the formation of clouds, along the vertically spiralling winds. Hence it forms the cumulonimbus clouds along with the cylindrically rising winds.
    - In this process, heat is released to the surrounding region, and they become relatively warm, 
    - And hence, rising air does not cool, and hence continues to rise.
    - This causes more suction at the surface of the ocean, hence more winds move horizontally inward, picking more moisture from the ocean surface.
    - And hence carrying more heat. This way the low pressure keeps intensifying, the inward spiralling continues, and the rising air also continues, with more condensation and heat release in the upper parts, along with cloud formation and precipitation.
    - Hence, with strong low pressure and fast and strong spiralling winds, and rising winds causing vertical cumulonimbus clouds and associated heavy precipitation, cyclonic conditions develop.
    - And this is how tropical cyclones are initiated.
    - For tropical cyclone development, the vertical wind shear should be less.
    - This means, vertically at different levels, the wind speed and direction should not vary much.
    - Else the vertical structure of tropical cyclones does not develop well.
    - Also, in the upper atmosphere, divergent wind conditions should be there.
    - So that more and more winds can rise from below, strengthening the tropical cyclone.
    - Hence, for the development for tropical cyclones, a wide range of conditions need to be fulfilled simultaneously. Hence they do not form easily everywhere.

##### Different parts of the Tropical Cyclone:

- - The low-pressure centre is known as the eye of the cyclone.
    - The vertical surrounding region is known as the ‘eye-wall of the cyclone.
    - Normally eye of cyclones is a relatively calm and clear sky.
    - The eye is around 16 to 30km.
    - Eyewalls are around 30 to 60 km from the centre.
    - Outward spiral is also present in cyclones.
    - On the sides of the eyewall, we have some clouds called rainbands.
    - From rainband to rainband the width would be 600 km.
    - There might be some subsiding winds in the eye, however, it does not reach the bottom.
    - Because ITCZ does not reach South Atlantic and South-Eastern Pacific, hence tropical cyclones are not formed there.

##### Major Characteristics of Tropical Cyclones

- - Tropical cyclones are formed within tropical easterlies and hence they tend to move in an East to West direction.
    - The width of the tropical cyclone and the associated strong winds, and clouds, and precipitation, spreads over a region of around 600 to 1200 km.
    - Tropical cyclone continues to strengthen as long as it is located over the warm ocean region, while other required conditions are also fulfilled.
    - The wind speed of the spiralling winds can be as high as 250km/hr.
    - And the tropical cyclone might progress at a speed of 15 to 25 km/hr. moving with the trade wind, in the east to west direction.
    - Because the trade winds move towards the ITCZ, so as to converge, hence the tropical cyclone also moves towards the ITCZ.
    - And hence, it does not move towards the equator in general, but rather towards the tropics, where the ITCZ is located during the summer season.
    - When the tropical cyclones hit the land, the place where they hit the land is known as landfall.
    - The strength of the cyclone at the landfall is very high, or the highest as for the given cyclone.
    - And gradually as the cyclone proceeds overland because it is not able to pick more moisture and heat, hence a cyclone starts weakening over the land.
    - Hence generally landfall and further land movement weaken a cyclone, finally, it might end over land, by moving further landward.
    - But it would cause a lot of destruction on land by them.
    - Sometimes the cyclone is able to cross the land and again reach the ocean on the other side of the land.
    - If the conditions in the other ocean are also favourable for the cyclone, then the cyclone might further strengthen.
    - For example, practically, on the Southeast Asian and East Asian coast, a large number of tropical cyclones form, and as they cross Indo-China and Malaya Peninsula, they reach to the Bay of Bengal region, where sometimes they further strengthen.
    - Hence, some of the tropical cyclones of the North-Western Pacific do move over to the Bay of Bengal.
    - And similarly, fewer tropical cyclones of the Bay of Bengal might cross over to the Arabian Sea, by crossing the Indian Peninsula.
    - After landfall, if the cyclone tends to recurve back towards the ocean while moving to higher latitudes, it tends to strengthen and become a stronger cyclone.
    - Normally recurving makes the cyclone stronger.
    - Recurving might happen, if the low-pressure condition towards which the cyclone was moving along with remaining trade winds is relocated, like the relocation of the ITCZ.
    - Also if some strong low pressure is created over the ocean, it might cause recurving.
    - Tropical cyclones also lead to phenomena known as Storm Surge near the coastal regions of landfall.
    - Storm surges are created when due to the low pressure of tropical cyclones, the water is risen by a few meters in the coastal areas, and due to very strong winds, the waves generated near the coast might hit at high speed.
    - This causes a high level of destruction in coastal areas, making storm surge as the most devastating tropical cyclone phenomenon in the coastal region.

##### Naming of Cyclones:

- - Cyclone naming is done in Nine regions of the world.
    - Six regional specialized meteorological centres and five regional tropical warning centres, which give warning for cyclones.
    - Indian Meteorological Department is one of the six RSMCs to provide tropical cyclone and storm surge advisories to 13 member countries (including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Qatar, etc.). Along with naming the tropical cyclones of the Northern Indian Ocean region. Including the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
    - All these 13 countries, provide a list of 13 names each, making a total list of 169 names.
    - These names are local names as per these countries' cultures.
    - So that every cyclone can be given a specific name. 
    - And hence specific warnings can be generated for each cyclone.

##### Tropical cyclone from an Indian perspective:

- - Though in the North Indian Ocean region, only 7% of the world’s cyclone takes place but their impact is high and devastating, because the coastal regions have high density of population, especially coastal regions of Bay of Bengal.
    - In this region, there are two peaks, October to November having a maximum number of cyclones, as after this ocean tend to cool.
    - The second peak is May to June, 13 coastal states and union territories with their 85 districts are affected by tropical cyclones in India.
    - Four on eastern coast Andhra Pradesh, Pondicherry, Odisha, West Bengal.
    - And one state Gujarat on the western coast is highly vulnerable to these cyclones.
    - In India, Odisha gets the maximum number of tropical cyclones.

**Why more tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal than the Arabian Sea?**

- - On an average for every 1 tropical cyclone in the Arabian Sea, there are three tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, because:
        - One, the Bay of Bengal water is relatively warmer than that of the Arabian Sea.
        - Second, more freshwater addition in the Bay of Bengal, so less saline and more evaporation.
        - Third, some tropical cyclones of the North-western Pacific come to Bay of Bengal.
        - However, fewer tropical cyclones of the Bay of Bengal move on to the Arabian Sea.

**Why less tropical cyclones during the monsoon?**

- - More rain, oceans have high pressure and 
    - Colder water in ocean due to rains.

##### Recent understanding of Tropical Cyclones as per Sixth IPCC Report

- - As per this Sixth Report of IPCC, the following major understanding has been developed about Tropical Cyclones: 
    - Globally we will have more tropical cyclones.
    - We will get wetter and windier tropical cyclones.
    - Tropical cyclones will shift to higher latitudes and hence, even higher latitudes are getting warmer.
    - More explosive tropical cyclones because they are intensifying rapidly.
    - The movement of cyclones is generally slowing down.
    - Also, climate change is affecting different tropical cyclones by increasing their severity.
    - Another group of Indian scientists has recently supported this IPCC view that the intensity of cyclones is increasing in the Northern Indian Ocean region.
    - With respect to temperate cyclones, especially the sub-polar region, normally, the very rapid growth of cyclones takes place with the atmospheric pressure dropping at least 24 millibars per day.
    - Which creates explosive temperate cyclones in these regions, known as bomb cyclones, or bombogenesis.

**Different weather disturbances in terms of time and size:** 

- - When we see different weather disturbances taking place in the atmosphere, we find them to have different sizes and times. 
    - Major ones are mentioned below in terms of decreasing size and time: 
        - Wave type of creation in Upper Atmosphere (Rossby Waves and Jet Streams).
        - Temperate Frontal Cyclones : Cold Front Cyclones/ Warm Front Cyclones (May remain for a week or more, size is 2000 km or more).
        - Tropical Cyclone (Size is 600 to 1200 km, might remain for a few days or weeks).
        - Land Breeze, sea breeze, local warm winds, and cold winds.
        - Thunderstorms (a few hours to a few days).
            - They might stretch a few 10s of km to a few hundreds of km.
        - Tornadoes, water spurts, smaller thunderstorms, might be for a few minutes to a few hours, and size might be a few kilometres.
        - Finally, you might have a few turbulent Eddies.

### Thunderstorms

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 59.png>)

- - Thunderstorms are when we have dark clouds with somewhat strong winds generally, and very heavy rain, which continues for some time.
    - There are three stages of thunderstorms.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 60.png>)

- - Developing, mature and dissipating, stages.
    - Developing Stage: When there is heat convection or some mechanical rise of winds, causing cumulus cloud formation. Which might get some rain and lightning initially.
    - As this stage continues, the cumulus cloud gradually develops into high vertical cumulonimbus clouds. 
    - From the top of these cumulonimbus clouds, large raindrops start to fall down.
    - Which also drag the air with them downwards, creating vertical air downdrafts. 
    - Mature Stage: Where convection on one side and downdraft on the other side simultaneously occur.
    - This is when we receive heavy rainfall accompanied by lightning and thunder and sometimes strong wind also. 
    - This stage continues for a few minutes to maybe an hour, causing heavy rains, which we generally associate with thunderstorms. 
    - This also leads to the gradual cooling of the earth's surface, which is the most common cause of the initial convection in the developing stage.
    - Hence by the end of the mature stage, as the thunderstorm rains come to an end, the convection also comes to an end, which was causing the cumulonimbus clouds.
    - This is the beginning of the end of a thunderstorm, what we call a dissipating stage. 
    - Dissipating Stage: In this due to the downdraft due to heavy downward rains, with no further cumulonimbus cloud formation, the thunderstorm comes to an end. As the rains gradually end.

### Lightning and Thunder:

- - Normally lightning and thunder are associated with dense cloud formation, and thunderstorm or similar heavy rain phenomena.
    - Lighting is created when two clouds vertically one above the other rub against each other or within a vertical cloud like a cumulonimbus cloud, the upward moving small droplets cause friction, and accumulate charge, with respect to downward moving larger droplets.
    - When the air between these two charged layers does not allow the charges to flow from one region to the other, then there is no electric current.
    - But when the charges are high enough they tend to fuse, an electric current passes from one layer to other.
    - But because air is a poor conductor, hence it extremely heats up and burns with the temperature shooting up to 20,000 degrees Celsius.
    - This burning is what we see as the lightning.
    - Once the charges have fully moved across, the current comes to an end, so does the burning.
    - And hence the lightning also comes to an end.

**Thunder:** 

- - When the air burns suddenly due to the heavy current flowing through it, it expands suddenly creating a cracking noise.
    - The same is produced also when the current suddenly stops, and the air suddenly cools, again producing a cracking noise.

**Tornados**

- - Tornadoes occur in temperate regions.
    - They occur where warm air rises to form cumulonimbus clouds.
    - Hence normally tornadoes occur on the leading edge of cold fronts.
    - Along the cold front, as the warm air rises and causes cumulonimbus clouds, from the bottom of such cumulonimbus clouds a small trunk-like formation starts growing towards the surface of the earth.
    - Due to spiral upward wind, it further increases, speed increases, up to 350 km/hr., hence trunk-like formation occurs. 
    - Coriolis force is higher in higher latitudes; hence speeds are high.
    - Along the leading edge of a cold front, because of rising warm air and cumulonimbus cloud formation.
    - And also due to strong spiralling winds, over higher latitudes due to higher Coriolis force, normally from the bottom of the cumulonimbus clouds, long trunks start to grow downwards. 
    - And when the growing trunks touch the ground, we call them as tornadoes. 
    - The wind speeds in tornadoes might be as high as 350 km/hr, and hence they are very devastating though smaller in size, as they form over few meters to a few hundred meters on the ground, and hence much smaller than tropical cyclones.
    - When tornadoes move over water bodies, they tend to spin and throw away water, a phenomenon we call as water sprout.
    - Highest number of tornadoes take place in USA(13,00 tornadoes every year), and also Canada, also Europe, Australia, South America, South Africa, New Zealand, and parts of Japan, Korea, China.

**Dust Devils:**

- - Dust devils are strong dust winds, taking place in the drier parts, especially deserts and desert surrounding regions. 
    - Where whirlpools of dust are created due to localized low pressures, created during hotter days.

## Monsoon

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 61.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 24.jpeg>)

- - The word comes from the Persian word Mausam.
    - This term is used in the context of the season which comes over the Indian subcontinent, between the dry summer and the dry winter season.
    - This is a wet season, especially during the late summers, when the wind directions are generally from the ocean to the land, also known as summer monsoon. 
    - Which is different from the late monsoon season, also known as winter monsoon.
    - When the wind directions reverse, as compared to summer monsoon periods, and generally the winter monsoon is also relatively drier with some exceptions. 
    - Hence, simply said, the monsoon season is the season of wind direction reversal, between the two half parts of the season, where the first half the summer monsoon is relatively much wetter, whereas the latter half is relatively much drier.
    - At the end of the monsoon, winters start.
    - The monsoon season has been observed for a very long time, over the Indian subcontinent region, and has been explained differently based on our improving understanding about the phenomenon.
    - Presently as we understand monsoon, it is considered a very complex phenomenon, to the extent that even IMD is still researching to understand monsoon in its completeness. And carrying out many research projects to better predict monsoon.
    - And it is using a Multi-model ensemble (MME) to predict the monsoon, where it uses eight predictors or indicators from across the world to predict the monsoon.

**The eight predictors are:**

- - The temperature of land in Europe.
    - Equatorial Pacific water volume.
    - The Surface Temperature of water between North Pacific and North Atlantic.
    - Indian Ocean Surface Temperature.
    - East Asian Atmospheric Pressure.
    - El-Nino phenomenon between Australia and South America.
    - North Atlantic Sea Level Pressure.
    - Winds in Central Pacific.

- - These are used by the IMD, to better predict monsoon over the Indian Subcontinent, which is the classical/most ideal monsoon region in the world, though the phenomenon of monsoon extends to the Arabian Peninsula and Africa, Southeast Asia, Northern Australia, and parts of eastern Asia.
    - But still, the IMD predictions are not 100% correct, telling how complicated the phenomenon must be.
    - For our purpose, we will try to understand the different major aspects of phenomena affecting monsoon.
    - As it can be said, the overall monsoon phenomenon is broadly an outcome of different phenomena, all adding up together to give the final resultant monsoon.

### Various major aspects or factors affecting monsoon:

- - Like large-scale land and sea breeze. Role of local winds. 
    - Shifting of trade winds: Global surface winds.
    - Affected by ITCZ: Role of Pressure belts.
    - Affected by Jet Streams: Such as sub-tropical westerly jet stream, hence role of upper atmosphere winds.
    - Also affected by the tropical easterly jet: Hence the role of upper atmospheric winds.
    - Affected by the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau: Role of major land features.
    - Affected by Ocean-Atmosphere coupled phenomenon: Such as El-Nino, La-Nina, Indian Ocean Dipole, Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).
    - The role of other secondary winds.

##### Monsoon as Land and Sea Breeze:

- - The simplest explanation of monsoon.
    - It divides it into summer monsoon, and winter monsoon on the other side.
    - During summers, land is heated, has low pressure, hence wind blows from sea to land. They are like see breeze.
    - During winters, the ocean has low pressure, the wind blows from land to ocean. Like a land breeze.
    - Therefore, dry on land during winter. 
    - But as per this model, every time, we should have the summer season, we should also get very good monsoon rains, and hence hotter the summer period, better should be the monsoon rains.
    - But in reality, this is not observed. Because, many years during hot summers, despite of high temperature over land, we still do not get good summer monsoon rains.
    - This shows the limitations of this monsoon explanation using the local wind analogy. 
    - Hence shifting trade wind analogy was used, which does not directly depend on the land temperature for sea and land breeze.

##### Effect of shifting trade winds: 

- - In the summer period (of India), June-Sept, the pressure belt has shifted, the equatorial pressure belt has shifted northward, hence southern hemisphere trade wind will shift.
    - As per the shifting trade wind explanations, during the Indian subcontinent late summer, June to Sept, the equatorial low pressure belt is around Tropic of Cancer, hence, the trade winds also shift towards the tropic of cancer, hence, southern hemisphere south-easterly trade winds cross the equator, and due to rightward effect of Coriolis Force, in Northern Hemisphere, the south-easterly trade winds become the South-westerly winds of Northern hemisphere, also known as South Westerly or the Summer Monsoon winds.
    - These summer monsoon winds carry the moisture from the Indian Ocean to the Indian subcontinent causing rains. I.e. Indian Summer monsoon rains.

##### Winter Monsoon:

- - As per October-December, during the Indian winter season, the equatorial low-pressure belt is near the Tropic of Capricorn, hence the trade winds also try to converge.
    - Hence the north-eastern trade winds move over the Indian subcontinents as the North East Monsoon or the winter monsoon.
    - And, because it is moving from land to sea, it does not cause any rain during these Indian winter seasons.
    - After crossing the equator, these winds due to the change in direction of Coriolis force, become Northwest Trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere, also known as Australian North-West monsoon winds or the Australian Summer monsoon winds, because during these months it is summer in Australia.
    - And because the Northwest monsoon winds are moving from sea to land, in Northern Australia, they bring monsoon rains in Northern Australia.
    - In India, it is the dry winter season.
    - But there is a limitation of this also, that it does not explain summer monsoon rains North of Tropic of Cancer in the North Eastern States, Bihar, UP, Haryana, Punjab, and foothills of Himalayas.
    - This is where the ITCZ explanation comes into role.

##### Role of ITCZ:

- - In July month ITCZ crosses the Tropic of Cancer in the Indian Subcontinent.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 62.png>)

- - As per this explanation, the ITCZ during the Indian Summer season shifts up to the southern foothills of the Himalayas, because of ITCZ is the zone of convergence of trade winds, hence, as per the summer season diagram, the trade winds also shift up to the ITCZ. 
    - Hence, the South Easterly trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere, cross the equator, and due to the Coriolis Force in Northern Hemisphere, these trade winds bend towards the right, i.e. towards the east.
    - Hence, move like Southwest monsoon winds, also known as summer monsoon over India.
    - South West trade winds moving over the western North Indian Ocean pick moisture from this region, as cause the summer monsoon rain, over Indian Subcontinent, up to the Southern Foothills of Himalayas.
    - During the onset of winter in the Northern Hemisphere (October to December), the sun shifts towards the Tropic of Capricorn, hence the ITCZ also shifts towards the Tropic of Capricorn.
    - And hence over the northern parts of Australia.

**Challenge with ITCZ explanation:**

- - ITCZ's explanation does not explain the delay of the southwest monsoon of India, in reaching over the Indian subcontinent.
    - Or reaching over the Northern parts of India.
    - This is explained by the location of the subtropical westerly jet stream, as given below:
    - During the Northern Hemisphere winter, which is the Southern Hemisphere summer, the ITCZ is over the northern Australian region, which is the ‘tropic of Capricorn.
    - Hence, the North-East Trade winds of the Northern Hemisphere, move over Indian Subcontinent, as North-East monsoon or winter monsoon.
    - And hence is generally dry for most of India.
    - When these trade winds cross the equator, they move like North West Monsoon over Northern Australia.
    - And they cause rain over the Australian region.

**Role of the location of Sub-tropical Westerly Jet Streams:**

- - As per the diagram of sub-tropical westerly jets steams, during northern hemisphere winters, due to southward shifting of the pressure belts and hence, of the Hadley and Ferrel Cells 
    - Even the sub-tropical westerly jet shifts southwards.
    - Also, during winters the height of tropopause decreases in higher latitudes, hence the Subtropical Westerly Jet is even lowered vertically.
    - Because of these two effects, the Subtropical Westerly Jets is located along the Himalayas, moving West to East.
    - Hence these sub-tropical westerly jets are bifurcated into Northern and Southern parts respectively.
    - Hence, during the winter sub-tropical westerly jet is partly located South of the Himalayas, as shown.
    - This also implies that part of the Northern Hadley Cell is located South of the Himalayas.
    - During Northern Hemisphere summers, we expect the sun to shift northwards, hence the pressure belts to shift northwards, hence, the Hadley and Ferrel Cells to shift northwards.
    - And therefore finally, the subtropical westerly jets to shift northwards, and also, to higher altitudes.
    - Hence, the subtropical westerly jet is no more expected to be bifurcated by the Himalayas.
    - This way, when the subtropical westerly jet shifts fully northwards of the Himalayas, now, the ITCZ can shift up to the foothills of the Himalayas.
    - Hence, only when the ITCZ is able to reach up to the foothills of the Himalayas, then the Indian summer monsoon is experienced over the whole of the Indian subcontinent.
    - But during some years, it is seen that the region north of the Himalayas does not get enough warmed up, hence the pressure belts do not shift northwards as required.
    - And hence, the subtropical westerly jet also does not shift northward or higher in altitude.
    - Hence, a part of the subtropical westerly jet remains south of the Himalayas, and hence, the ITCZ is not able to reach up to the foothills of the Himalayas even during this part of summer.
    - And hence, the Southwest monsoon or the summer monsoon of India is also not able to move over the Indian subcontinent.
    - This way, the whole monsoon phenomenon is sometimes delayed over India, over northern parts of the subcontinent.
    - But still, the variability in monsoon is still not explained by all the above factors.
    - Variability means Some years we get good monsoon, whereas in some other years, we get average monsoon or poor monsoon.
    - This is not explained by any of the above factors and hence the role of the Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau, tropical easterly jets and an additional role of sub-tropical westerly jets comes into play, as explained below.
    - During the summers of the Northern Hemispheres, the subtropical westerly jet moves north of the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau.

**Role of Tibetan Plateau:**

- - Tibetan Plateau gets warmer than normal and hence the surface atmospheric pressure of Tibetan Plateau is low pressure, and hence upper atmosphere over Tibetan Plateau is high pressure.
    - This causes a clockwise circulation in the upper atmosphere.
    - This leads to the formation of tropical easterly jets, from the subtropical westerly jets.

**Tropical Easterly Jet:**

- - Tropical easterly jet formation and strengthening: 
        - It is a strong wind condition.
    - During summers, while the tropical easterly jet is moving over the Northern Indian ocean, 
    - Near the surface of the Indian Ocean, around the Arabian Sea region, there is relatively high pressure.
    - As seen in the diagram during summers due to the upper atmosphere conditions, the tropical easterly jet formation takes place. 
    - During summer, in the Arabian Sea, there is surface High Pressure with corresponding low pressure in the upper atmosphere.
    - This upper atmosphere low pressure is in the region where the tropical easterly jet stream is flowing.
    - Hence they are taken up by the upper atmosphere low pressure, and partly sent to the ocean surface high pressure as shown in the second diagram.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 25.jpeg>)

- - Hence the winds from the surface high pressure this way strengthen, therefore strengthening, the South West Monsoon.
    - Hence, simply said, the strength of the tropical easterly jet, affects the strength of the summer monsoon over India.
    - The strength of the tropical easterly jets is determined by the extent of heating of the Tibetan Plateau, as well as the position and strength of subtropical westerly jets.
    - All these factors play a role in the variability of the Indian Monsoon.

**Role of all these (Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau, Subtropical Westerly Jet) in winter season:**

- - No easterly jet is formed in winters.
    - During the winter season, the subtropical westerly jet is partly bifurcated by the Himalayas moving both North and South of the Himalayas, also the Tibetan Plateau surface is much colder with surface high pressure, and upper atmosphere low pressure, hence no easterly jet is formed due to anticlockwise upper atmosphere circulation.
    - Rather the winter monsoon conditions prevail as explained earlier, and hence the North-East monsoon winds blow over the Indian Subcontinent.
    - The role of El Nino, La Nina, etc. will be covered later.

**Role of Somali Jet Stream:**

- - Somali Jet Stream is a low-level jet stream and hence simply driving the southwest monsoon towards the Sothern, Hence intensifying the Indian Monsoon.

##### Branches of Indian Monsoon

- - The South West Monsoon is broadly divided over the Indian Subcontinent into the Arabian Sea Branch and the Bay of Bengal Branch.
    - And these sub-branches are further subdivided as explained below:

**Arabian Sea branch:**

- - The Arabian Sea branch picks the moisture from the Arabian Sea, part of it becomes the Western Ghat branch.
    - Western Ghat: As we see that the Western Ghat branch of the Arabian Sea sub-branch approaches the Western Ghats from Kerala (Cardamom Hills) up to Maharashtra, Gujarat region (South of Tapi river).
    - It causes orographic rise on the windward western side of the Western Ghats, making this region a par humid region of India (250-400 cm plus rainfall annually in this region).
    - On the leeward eastern side of Western Ghats, the rains gradually decline, making the interiors relatively up to semi-arid.
    - Central Highland, Vindhya, Satpura: The second branch of the Arabian Sea sub-branch enters North of Tapi up to East of Aravalli Hills. 
    - This branch moves up to the Chhota Nagpur Plateau region and brings some rain in all this region (North of Mumbai, moving over the Narmada and Tapi Valleys, up to Chota Nagpur region), where it contributes around 15 cm rainfall annually.
    - West of Aravalli: The third branch of the Arabian Sea sub-branch moves west of Aravalli's. And because of lack of orographic or other factors, it causes very less rain in this region.
    - And hence this region is a relatively arid region or desert region.

**Bay of Bengal sub-branch:**

- - The Bay of Bengal sub-branch is diverted by the Arakan Yoma and Pegu Yoma hills of the Myanmar region, towards the north and relatively North-west.
    - East of Meghalaya Plateau: Here the Bay of Bengal branch gets bifurcated into 3 sub-branches, which is east of Meghalaya Plateau, which moves between Paranuchal hills and Meghalaya Plateau on its west. 
    - Then this sub-branch continues to move westward over the Assam plains towards Bihar and UP region and up to Jammu and Kashmir, moving south of Himalayas.
    - Meghalaya Plateau branch: The second sub-branch of the Bay of Bengal sub-branch moves towards the Meghalaya Plateau, which is broadly made up of three hills: Garo, Khasi, and Jayantiya. 
    - Hence this sub-branch creates an orographic effect as well as a funnelling effect in these hills, making some of the rainiest places in these hills, like Mawsynram and Cherrapunji.
    - West Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa: The third sub-branch moves over parts of Bangladesh, West Bengal, Orissa, towards Jharkhand, Bihar, UP and gradually moves toward Jammu Kashmir, causing decreasing rain from east to west.
    - When all these branches meet with the western Aravalli Branch in Punjab Haryana, they cause relatively more rain over there, than the Rajasthan regions. 

##### Normal Dates For Onset of South West Monsoon

**Old Dates of arrival and departure of Monsoon:**

- - As per this, the summer monsoon was arriving as per the following dates: 
        - Andaman & Nicobar by 28th May
        - Kerala & Tamil Nadu by 1st June and the whole of the country up to Rajasthan and Punjab by 15th July.
    - The departure of the monsoon was as per following dates:
        - Punjab & Rajasthan's departure started on 1st September.
        - By 15th Oct. departed from the rest of the country except Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.
        - By 15th Dec. departed from all of the countries.

**In 2020, IMD revised some of the dates of arrival & departure as follows:**

- - The new dates of onset of the arrival of monsoon were:
        - A&N by 27 May
        - Kerala & Tamil Nadu by 1st June
        - But it covers whole of the country up to Rajasthan & Punjab one week earlier of the old normal that is 8th July.

**Further Revision by IMD are as follows:**

- - Started departure from Rajasthan, Punjab nearly 2 weeks later than the old normal date i.e. started from 17th September.
    - By 15th Oct. departed from the rest of the country except for 5 southern states Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and departed from the whole of the country 15th December.

**Precipitation received during Monsoon and other periods:**

- - India's average rainfall is around 125 cm rainfall per year, out of this nearly 75% of the total rainfall is received during the 3 months of summer monsoon mainly June, July, August.
    - Whereas during the remaining 9 months of the year we received only 25% of the annual rainfall.
    - This shows that precipitation in India is very Non-uniform. Apart from this even the rainfall distribution when seen in different regions varies differently.
    - For example; some of the dry desert regions of Rajasthan receives less rainfall annually in 15th cm whereas the wet places receive around 1170 CM.
    - In terms of duration of the rains also some regions have only 5 rainy days in a year in dry regions and some of the wet places 150 days in a year.

##### Ocean Atmospheric Coupled Phenomenon(OACP)

- - Ocean Atmospheric Coupled Phenomenon means that some condition created in the ocean is leading to resulting conditions over the atmosphere causing atmospheric phenomena of the weather & Climate.

**A simple understanding of most of the OACP is as follows:**

- - **South Pacific Ocean oscillation: Normal Day**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 63.png>)

- - As shown in the normal year diagram, cold Peruvian and Humboldt current moves from the Antarctic region towards the tropical equatorial region along the western South American coast.
    - The tropical trade winds moving from east to west carry cold water westwards and while moving over this long distance of westwards up to tropical eastern Australian coast, this water becomes warm water.
    - Hence, Tropical Eastern Australian coast warm water accumulates during a normal year.
    - On the tropical Western South American coast, because cold water is being removed westwards causing Surface-water deficiency hence rising of deep ocean cold water takes place bringing more cold water to the surface, this rising of cold water is known as upwelling the colder water to the coast.
    - Hence, simply said during a normal year, in the tropical regions, the Westerns South American coast as colder water getting removed westwards, whereas eastern Australian coast has warmer water accumulating.
    - Due to accumulated warmer water along the western side of the ocean, some water tries to flow back towards the eastern side.
    - Though the strong trade wind does not allow this in the tropical region in the doldrum weak winds equatorial region some water success to continuously flow from the western and eastern side of the ocean and this flow is known as the counter equatorial current which carries some of the accumulated water back eastwards during normal years.
    - In normal year due to the mixing of Peruvian current and upwelling water along with the Peruvian coast nutrient for fish is available and hence fishes are also available which during a normal year gives normal fish catch to the fishermen in the region.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 64.png>)

**The EL NINO Year:**

- - The El Nino Phenomena happens every 3-5 years during this period the coastal water temperature condition along with Australian and the South American coast interchange as compared to the normal year.
    - During the El Nino years, the accumulated water on the tropical Australian coast becomes voluminous enough in amount so as to oppose and overcome the trade wind effect and rather create a west to east water flow in the tropical region.
    - When this flow reaches the tropical western South American coast, the water is relatively warmer than at the Australian coast than mainly because of traveling in the warmer tropical region.
    - Also as the Australian coastal surface water is removed it does lead to some upwelling here also causing some pulling of the Australian coastal water. On the other hand, along the Peruvian coast both the upwelling as well as current water reaching the surface water and hence very less mixing very fewer nutrients and very less fish availability.
    - This phenomenon starts around NOV. DEC. and continues from nearly 3 months to next year May June.
    - Because the fish catch during Nov Dec. low during such years and also the coastal water is warmer than normal, hence the Latin speaking Christianity following people called it as the arrival of Christ child or the boy child.
    - Hence, it is called the EL Nino Phenomenon and such years are called El Nino Years.
    - Simply said, During El Nino's years starting from November, December till next year May June the Australian coast has relatively cooler water whereas the Peruvian coast has relatively warmer water.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 65.png>)

- - **The La Nina year(Once Every 5-8 years):**
    - During La Nina year, the Peruvian current is stronger than normal bringing more colder water to the Peruvian coast.
    - Also, the trade winds are relatively stronger and hence carry more water towards the Australian Coast hence causing more upwelling and mixing and colder water on the Peruvian coast.
    - This is experienced by the coastal people during more fish catch and colder than normal coaster water and hence called as La Nina year on the arrival of girl child year.
    - Hence, Simply said, during the La Nina years we get stronger than normal Peruvian current colder water on the Peruvian coast and warmer water on the Australian coast.
    - Hence, it is like a stronger normal year.

**Atmospheric Phenomenon:**

- - **Southern Oscillation or ENSO Phenomenon :**
        - Simply said, ENSO and SO are near cyclic changes of pressure conditions between the Peruvian Coast and the Eastern Australian coast.
        - The pressure index is also known as Southern Index.
        - An index is the comparative value of any phenomenon observed over a given period.
        - E.g. Democracy India, Sensex, Ease of Doing Index.

- - Southern Oscillation Index: It is a measure of the difference between broadly the pressure conditions and the related outcomes between Tahiti in Central Southern Atlantic, representing the eastern oceanic phenomena, and on the other hand eastern coast of Australia representing the western side of Pacific.
    - SOI= P(E)-P(W)
    - Therefore,
        - If P(e) is higher, SOI is positive,
        - Else, if P(e) is lower then SOI is negative.
    - During a normal year, SOI will be positive (because Tahiti a colder place has more temperature and more pressure).
    - During El Nino year, SOI is negative.
    - During La Nina year, SOI is ‘high positive’.
    - Hence, in this way, SOI helps us in comparing the Normal years, El Nino years, and La Nina years in a numerical way.

**Walker Cell:**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 66.png>)

- - Walker Cell is a wind phenomenon along with its vertical components forming east-west wind cells.
        - A: Over the Tropical Southern Pacific region.
        - B: Tropical Southern Indian Ocean Region.

**Normal Year Walker Cell formation:** 

- - During Normal Years, starting from November December and continuing for nearly April May, the tropical Peruvian Coast has cold temperature and high pressure, whereas the eastern tropical Australian coast, has warm temperature and hence low pressure.
    - Hence, winds blow from High Pressure to low pressure, i.e. South America to Australia, and hence form normal year Pacific Walker Cell.
    - Due to low pressure in Australia, winds come to Australia from even tropical African side over the tropical Southern Indian Ocean forming the normal year Indian Ocean Walker circulation.
    - These winds continue to April, hence the normal year Walker Cells are formed.
    - As shown in the second diagram, the Indian winter monsoon, or the North-East Monsoon Part, moves over cold dry Indian land, toward the warm Indian ocean, and picks the heat and moisture from the Indian ocean, in the process of cooling the Indian ocean.
    - And moving in the Southern Hemisphere as the northwest Monsoon, which is the Australian Summer Monsoon.
    - Causing rains in Tropical Australia, these winds continue till almost March-April, and hence cool down the Indian Ocean region, by next year May June, Indian summer monsoon.
    - As we can see, this way the Indian winter monsoon and the summer monsoon, and the Australian monsoon are part of a monsoon cycle.
    - One part prepares and assists the other. 
    - As we can see in the diagram, the surface Indian Ocean Walker Cell wind assists the North West or Australian Monsoon, and this way, helps the normal monsoon cycle.
    - And hence helps in preparing for the Indian Summer monsoon.
    - Simply said, the Walker Cell of the normal year phenomenon of ENSO, helps in preparing the ocean and atmospheric conditions for the Indian Summer Monsoon.
    - Hence overall assist the global wind cycles.
    - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 67.png>)

**El Nino Years**

- - During El Nino Years, Australian Coast has relatively colder water, where whereas, the Peruvian Coast and Tahiti Coast, 
    - South American coast has warm water, hence up to Tahiti Coast it is warm water and low pressure.
    - Therefore in the western Pacific, winds blow from Australia to Tahiti, forming the El Nino year Walker Cell of Pacific.
    - Whereas from Tahiti to South America, weak winds blow as the Walker Cell winds oppose the trade winds.
    - Hence, only rising convections in Tahiti to South America region, causing clouds and rains here, during El Nino years.
    - Hence, simply said, the Walker Cell of Pacific of El Nino Year, forms only between Australia and Tahiti, and further opposes the Eastern South Pacific trade winds, hence opposing the Global primary wind system.
    - Therefore making global heat transfer inefficient.
    - Hence, adversely affecting the normal weather condition of different regions.
    - This means that normal year wet regions will become dry during El Nino, and vice versa.
    - In the IOR region, the Indian Ocean Walker cell winds move from Australia to Africa, hence opposing the Nov-December NW Australian monsoon, and hence weakening the Australian Monsoon.
    - As the Australian Monsoon winds are the extension of the Indian Winter monsoon, after picking heat and moisture from the Indian Ocean, hence the Indian Winter Monsoons might also be slightly affected.
    - Hence, the moisture and heat transfer from the Indian Ocean will be adversely affected.
    - Hence next year May-June, the Indian Ocean will remain relatively warmer, which is an adverse condition for the Indian Summer monsoon.
    - El Nino in this way adversely affects the Indian Monsoon conditions, and hence Indian Monsoon, which brings most of the monsoon rains to India.
    - Simply said: El Nino Year Walker Cell winds adversely affect the global primary and secondary winds.
    - And hence, also adversely affect Normal Year global weather and climate, including adversely affecting monsoons in India.
    - ENSO occurs in southern pacific ocean (common sense है यह मिस्टेक नहीं करना)

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 68.png>)

**La Nina Year Phenomenon:**

- - La Nina Year, being a stronger normal year, hence, the Walker Cell of Pacific is strengthened, hence global trade winds and primary wind cells are strengthened, over the Indian Ocean.
    - Indian ocean Walker Cell is also strengthened, hence, it strengthens the monsoon cycles, ultimately leading to a better than normal monsoon cycle, for both Australia and India over a period of a year.
    - Hence, simply said La Nina has a positive effect over the Indian Summer monsoon.
    - As per IMD, both monsoon and ENSO, are ocean-atmosphere coupled phenomena.
    - They generally have a broad relation between them, with El Nino years generally having adverse effects on summer monsoon in India.
    - La Nina generally has a positive effect on the Indian Summer monsoon.
    - And Normal Years: Not much affecting Indian Summer monsoons.
    - But IMD clarifies, that only slightly more than 40% chance of El Nino adversely affecting Indian Summer Monsoon. And around 35% chance of La Nina positively affecting Indian Summer monsoon rain.
    - Hence, simply said, every El Nino year, La Nina year does not necessarily affect summer monsoon rain.

**El Nino, La Nino, and Indian Agriculture:**

- - As per the data of Ministry of Finance, it said that for normal years, Indian agriculture has a growth rate of around 3.7%.
    - For El Nino years, the Indian agriculture growth rate is around - 2.1%.
    - For La Nina years, the Indian agriculture growth is around 8.4%.
    - But we have very few La Nina, few El Nino, and many Normal years.
    - For the overall average of all El Nino, La Nina, and Normal years, the Indian Agriculture growth rate as 3%.
    - This simply means that overall, the El Nino, La Nina cycle, or the Southern Pacific Oscillation has the net adverse effect on Indian Agriculture.

##### Indian Ocean Dipole

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 26.jpeg>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 27.jpeg>)

- - Indian Ocean Dipole in the tropical Indian Ocean region, where African Coast is western side, including India also.
    - Whereas the eastern side is the South East Asian region, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.
    - On an average, over a period of 30 years, four positive and four negative phases take place.
    - First, positive phase: Southeast Asian region, high pressure and hence dry. On the other hand, on the western side, African and Indian regions have low pressure and are wet.
    - And vice versa in the negative phase.
    - Positive and negative phases broadly take place alternatively.

**El Nino and La Nina Modoki Phenomena:**

- - They are the tropical northern Pacific phenomena where the Central Tropical Pacific behaves one way, and on the other hand, the Eastern and Western Tropical Pacific regions behave the other way.
    - The word ‘Modoki’ is a Japanese word, because in Northern Pacific, the phenomena is similar to El Nino and La Nina, hence called as “El Nino and La Nina Modoki”.
    - During the El Nino Modoki years, the central Pacific becomes warmer, low-pressure, and hence rainy, whereas, Eastern and Western Pacific become high-pressure and hence dry.
    - During La Nina Modoki years, vice versa happens.
    - The El Nino Modoki has a 3-5 years average, whereas La Nina Modoki has fewer occurrences than El Nino Modoki.
    - Modoki is also a 5-6 months phenomenon, starting from the summers of the region.

**Madden-Julian Oscillation**

- - This oscillation too, like other oscillations, has high pressure and low pressure.
    - But, unlike the other oscillations done earlier, Madden-Julian Oscillation is a continuously eastward shifting oscillation.
    - And hence it is not fixed to a region, but rather a shifting oscillation.
    - It has 2 phases over 2 regions simultaneously.
    - First: The low-pressure region, known as the enhanced convective phase causing good rains, whereas the high-pressure region is known as a suppressed convective phase and hence dry.
    - This oscillation takes place in the tropical region of the world, once formed it takes around 30 to 60 days to go around the world moving west to east.
    - Effect on India: 
        - Whenever India experiences the positive convective phase, for example, June 2015, and June 2018 which are generally dry months, peninsular India got more than average rain for the June month.
    - MJO can strengthen EL-Nino and can weaken La-Nina

# World Climatic Regions

**Major Elements useful in World Climatic Regions:** 

- - Range of Temperature.
    - Humidity and Precipitation 
    - Winds (Primary, Secondary or Tertiary winds) 
    - Sunshine available.
    - Vegetation is directly affected by humidity and temperature.

- - Five Groups on the basis of temperature:
        - 1st Group: Equatorial group,
        - 2nd Group: Tropical Group,
        - 3rd and 4th are temperate groups: further grouped into warm and cold temperate groups.
        - Lastly the Cold polar region (5th Group).

- - On the basis of sunshine world climatic regions are groped into the same five groups: 
        - 1. Equatorial: Having High Sunshine round the year.
        - 2. Tropical Region: Having Very High Sunshine during long warm seasons (nearly 9 months) and high sunshine during winter seasons.
        - 3. Warm Temperate Region: Having High sunshine during summers, and moderate sunshine during winters.
        - 4. Cool Temperate Group: Has moderate sunshine during summers and low sunshine during winters. 
        - 5. Polar Region: Has low sunshine round the year.

- - On the basis of humidity, the world climatic regions are divided into: 
        - A. The Continental Interior Climatic Regions (Regions 3, 6, and 9 in the diagram). Continentality is high in this region.
        - B. The Coastal Regions: Affected by Maritime Conditions. 
        - The coastal regions are further sub-divided into: 
        - The East Coast: (Regions 2, 7, and 10 in the diagram).
        - The West Coast: (Regions 4, 5, and 8 in the diagram).
        - This way, mainly due to the temperature, humidity, and precipitation, primary winds, trade winds/westerlies, etc., and sunshine, we have 11 distinct climatic regions in the world continents. (As shown in the diagram). 

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 69.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 70.png>)

**How major Climatic Factors Affect Vegetation:**

**Based on temperature:** 

- - Equatorial/Tropical vegetation (hot), e.g. Neem, Mango.
    - Temperate has Apple, etc.
    - Polar/Cold has: Conifer Trees

**Deciduous Trees:** 

- - **Climatic Factors:** 
        - Such trees will shed leaves in one season.
        - Such forests will shed leaves in one go, hence they are known as deciduous forests.
        - During autumn, the whole forest will shed the leaves.

**Biological Factors:**

- - They shed leaves during any part of the season.
    - Not all trees will shed together.
    - These are called as biological deciduous forests.
    - Biological deciduous forests are called as evergreen forests (no leave-less season, some plants will have leaves during any point in time).

**Evergreen Trees:** 

- - Temperate Evergreen Forests: They are smaller plants, also in polar and cool temperate regions, leave production is not easy, hence they do not shed the leaves.

**Moisture:**

- - In a major way, when the moisture availability is high round the year, also if the sunshine is available, then photosynthesis can happen round the year. 
    - And hence, a good amount of vegetation biomass will grow.
    - And hence the forest will be full of greens. 
    - And here, the trees will compete for sunshine for their growth.
    - As the moisture availability gradually decreases, the vegetation biomass produced decreases, and hence there will be lesser availability of trees and vegetation in the forest.
    - And hence the forests will not be very dense, with the lesser trees and lesser leaves.
    - If the moisture availability further decreases, then trees will gradually be replaced by scrubs, bushes, and grasses.
    - And hence we will get grasslands replacing the forests.
    - With the further decrease in moisture availability, even grasses might not grow, and a special type of dry region vegetation known as desert vegetation also known as xerophytic vegetation will occur, such as cactus.
    - Wetland is wetter than normal surroundings, such places have hydrophytes (water-based plants).
    - Halophytic vegetation: Salt tolerant plants.(mangroves)

##### Equatorial Region Climate:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 71.png>)

- - 10 degrees north/South we have the equatorial climate.
    - This includes South East Asia (ASEAN countries).
    - Similarly in Africa, western central Africa, Congo, etc. regions.
    - It is hot around the year, with very little variation during summer and winter.

- - **Temperature:**
        - Days are hot, and nights are also hot.
        - This is the region of Doldrums, with no fixed wind direction.
        - Rather in the island and coastal regions, land and sea breeze blow between day and night.
    - **Pressure:**
        - It is an equatorial low-pressure region, and hence cloudy and rainy around the year.
        - Mostly convectional rains are observed.
        - Hence during the morning, slightly low temperature, the equatorial region has generally clear skies.
        - By afternoon as temperature rises, convections lead to clouds and rains.
        - This is round a year phenomenon.
        - This is the reason that sunshine is not the highest at the equator.
    - Sunshine is high and intense.
    - Because the region has ample sunshine, high humidity, and moisture around the year, hence, plants can do photosynthesis round the year.
    - And hence plants grow around the year.
    - Hence equatorial vegetation grows in abundance in this region, and the only competition is rather for more and more sunshine.
    - Different varieties of vegetation in these regions coup up with this problem in different ways.
    - They generally have broad leaves, to collect more sunshine.
    - And size does not adversely affect in terms of water loss, because moisture is abundantly available.
    - Some trees grow very tall, so as to collect the sunlight on the top.
    - Some sunshine passes through such tall trees and hence intermediate layer of trees also grows.
    - As sunshine is intense and nearly perpendicular, hence some sunshine still passes through the intermediate layer, hence lower layers also grow, such as scrubs, wet scrubs, wet grasses.
    - Climbing vegetation also grows, on the trunks of the plants or trees.
    - Hence such forests are the densest vegetation forests, with the highest variety of vegetation, or highest vegetation biodiversity, such as the Forests in the South East Asian Islands, Congo Forests in Africa, Amazon forests in South America.
    - Such forests are evergreen forests made up of deciduous trees.
    - Only deciduous trees give fruit and flowers, these trees are flowering and fruit-bearing trees.
    - These forests are also called rainforests, as round the year rains support them.

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 72.png>)

##### Tropical Climatic Regions (2nd Region)

- - Tropical East Coast Climatic Region.
    - It is around 10 to 30 degrees.
    - This includes the Tropical Monsoon climate of India and Australia.

**Tropical Marine Climate:**

- - Tropical Marine regions have the trade winds blowing, and hence bring ample moisture during the long summer (nearly 9 months).
    - And slightly less moisture during the short winters (about 3 months).
    - This region will have a nearly good amount of moisture for nearly round the year, though not as much as the equatorial region.
    - Also, it will have very high sunshine through the long summers, and slightly more inclined sunshine during the winters.
    - The Subtropical High-Pressure belt does keep the moisture and precipitation slightly less.
    - Tropical Marine will include: South America, North American east coast, East Australia, East Africa
    - Vegetation: The Tropical Marine Region, especially near the coast, has the evergreen type of forest as one gradually moves toward the interior of the continent, the vegetation turns into wet deciduous forests also called (moist mixed deciduous).

**Tropical Monsoon Climate:**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 73.png>)

- - The tropical monsoon climate has similar temperature conditions as marine, though in interior continental parts it may be more intense heating and cooling during summer/winters.
    - But the most distinct feature is the short hot rainy season of 3 months preceded by the short hot dry summer.
    - And hence it has relatively 9 months of relative dryness.
    - The tropical monsoon is slightly drier than the tropical marine. (Tropical Marine is drier than Equatorial).
    - And within the tropical monsoon region, we have wetter, moderate, and drier regions.

**Vegetation:** 

- - As we move in the tropical monsoon region from the wettest monsoon parts having nearly evergreen forests, then as we proceed to lower rainfall regions we fine Tropical Wet Deciduous.
    - Tropical Evergreen Forest: In more than 200 cm rainfall.
    - Tropical Moist Deciduous: 100 to 150 cm.
    - Tropical Dry Deciduous: 100 to 70 cm.
    - Tropical Thorn Forests: Less than 70 cm rainfall.
    - As we move to dryer areas, the height of trees becomes less and less, also the size of leaves decreases.
    - Vegetation will become less.
    - In Thorn forests, leaves will turn into thorns.

##### Tropical Continental Interior (3rd Type)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 74.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 75.png>)

- - It has very hot long summers and short cold/cool winters.
    - The annual temperature range is more.
    - Pressure: Tropical high pressure, hence generally clear skies.
    - This region will have trade winds with lesser moisture, after passing over the east coast region.
    - Hence, relatively lesser rainfall, than tropical monsoon climate.
    - The relative humidity is less, overall lesser rainfall than tropical monsoon.
    - Trees cannot sustain much, hence we get tropical dry grasslands.
    - For which the Savanna Forests of Africa are well known.
    - Forests have much lesser trees.
    - Which are sparsely spread.
    - Such grasslands support a huge population of herbivores and hence carnivores.
    - Savanna Forest, in South Africa they are Bush Velds, Lanos, and Campos in South America.

##### West Coast Tropical Climatic Region (Fourth Type)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 76.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 2.gif>)

- - **Temperature:**
    - It has long very hot summer, winters are short and moderate.
    - Trade winds are dry, they don’t do precipitation.
    - No rains due to clear skies.
    - The tropical western coastal regions generally have cold ocean currents.
    - Bringing cold water to the coast.
    - Hence, even any Sea Breeze does not bring much moisture.
    - Therefore, this climatic region is very dry. 
    - Called Arid Regions, with rainfall less than 25 cm annually, and hence they are the tropical western coast deserts, in continents. 
    - **Vegetation:**
    - Here even grasses do not grow.
    - Due to the absence of moisture, and hence the xerophytic/desert vegetation grows here. Such as the cactus.
    - Characteristics of vegetation: 
    - Very long deep root to collect water.
    - Capacity to store water in trunk and branches.
    - Waxy surface to reduce water evaporation.
    - Thorny horns rather than leaves to avoid water evaporation.
    - Regions: Sahara Libyan, Nubian deserts in Africa, Namib, Kalahari, and Great Karu desert,
    - The Atacama in South America, Mohave in California, the Arabian, Thar, Iranian deserts, in Australia: Gibson, etc.

##### Warm Temperate Western Margins Climate Region:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 77.png>)

- - **Climatic Factors - Elements**
    - Temperature: Summer - long and hot to warm; Winters - short and colder 
    - Pressure: Sub-tropical High-Pressure Belts and clear skies 
    - Winds: Summer - tropical easterlies and winter - westerlies 
    - Is the region of shifting of pressure belts and global winds is observed.
    - Rainfall - More rains during winter; fewer rains during the summer
    - Mostly the rains/precipitation are from temperate cyclonic and overall less rainfall 
    - Presence of many types of local winds as this region is surrounded by a range of other climatic conditions - Westside is moist; east side dry; pole sides are very cold and equator side - very hot 
    - **Vegetation**:
    - Though on its tropical side, it has hot dry desert conditions this warm temperate region is relatively moderate temperature 
    - Hence nor very dry also due to some rains during winter as well as summer
    - Hence the vegetation is also relatively more moderated than tropical desert vegetation which means fewer trees, monsoon forests, capacity to store moisture in trunks, branches such as Corpwood, and generally broad trunk trees 
    - Small broad leaves start to appear again as compared to tropical deserts so as to collect more sunlight for photosynthesis
    - The trees along with leaves have a waxy leathery surface to reduce evaporation
    - Fruits also have a thick waxy surface along with storing a good amount of moisture such as citrus fruits like oranges, lemon, berry fruits including grapes, olive, etc
    - This is because the fruits processing industry is prominent in this region such as jam, wine, olive oil, etc which is generally consumed in this region  
    - Grasses generally do not grow much and hence animal production is less
    - This climate is also known as Mediterranean Climate - found along the region in Mediterranean region; also on western coats of USA i.e. the California region; western coast of South America i.e. Central Coastal Chile; Cape Town region in South Africa; Southern region of Australia

##### Warm Temperate Continental Interior:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 78.png>)

- - **Temperature**: The temperature range is high; short winters but very cold; long summers but decently hot 
    - Summer - tropical easterly with not too much moisture and winters - westerly with not too much moisture
    - Overall rainfall will be less in winter; mostly temperate cyclonic whereas in summer - both cyclonic as well as some conventional; hence overall precipitation will be relatively more in summer than winter
    -  This region will have lesser trees than the Mediterranean climate and summer rains will generally support the growth of grasses
    - This region will be a temperate grasslands region i.e. just poleward of tropical grasslands (Region 3 - Savanah Grasslands)
    - These grasslands are more nutritional as evaporation is less; very few trees  
    - In the temperate grasslands also, the region getting more rain will have taller grass whereas the regions getting fewer rains will have shorter grass 
    - Steppes Temperate Grasslands will have shorter grassland as compared to Prairies grasslands in North America
    - In Europe - Pustaz; China - Manchuria Grasslands; South America - Pampas; Africa - High Veld; Australia - Downs and Canterbury Grasslands

**Types of Grasses**:

- - Very Hot:
    - Wet - Equatorial; Tropical Marine and Wet Tropical Monsoon = Wet tropical grass regions = Rice and Sugarcane
    - Dry - Tropical Dry monsoon and Savannah Grasslands = Dry tropical grass = Dry coarse grains - Jowar, Bajra, Ragi

- - Warm and Cold:
    - Dry - the Mediterranean and Temperate Grasslands = Dry temperate grass (need some cold seasons also) - Wheat, Oats, Barley, Rye, etc 

##### Warm Temperate Eastern Margin:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 79.png>)

- - Regions = Nanking - China Type; North America - Gulf of Mexico; South Africa - Natal 
    - Highest continentality in Nanking in China; South Africa's Natal region will have maximum maritime region 
    - Pampero in South America and Sydney in Australia
    - During Summer - Tropical Easterlies in these regions bring moisture and rain as they are coming from east.
    - During Winter - Westerlies will blow above them; In China type because of coming from the continental interior will be dry and giving dry winters to China type 
    - In the South American Natal Region, the westerlies will have the least continentality effect and hence will carry more moisture eventually giving more wetter winters 
    - The other region such as the Gulf of Mexico, South America, and Australia/New Zealand regions will have moderate winter rains 
    - So, the Natal type is wetter round the year and hence have more maritime effect 
    - Whereas, China type will have wet summers but dry winters due to relatively more continentality effect
    - Vegetation:
    - Natal type - Denser and relatively evergreen
    - China type - Deciduous variety and less dense
    - They will have broad leave vegetation, etc

##### Warm Temperate High Continentality Leeward Side Rain Shadow Regions:

- - In this region, the interiors of the continent, especially on the leeward sides of the mountains, we get relatively very high continentality and hence very dry regions
    - These are the desert regions - temperate deserts of high continentality rather than tropical western margin deserts
    - Gobi Desert and Taklamakan Desert; Patagonia Desert in South America; Ladakh desert - as it is on the leeward side of Karakoram Mountains, etc 

##### Cold Temperate Western Margins Climatic Region:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 80.png>)

- - It falls within the ambit of the Polar front region
    - Temperature:
    - The western margin has a warm current on its coast 
    - During Summers, the westerlies move over the warm current and hence the summers will be relatively warmer - short summers with some rain
    - Winters will be moderated due to maritime and warm currents
    - Also, very strong fronts will be created between Polar Easterlies and Warmer Coastal Maritime Airmasses 
    - Hence we will get stronger and more frequent cyclonic conditions causing generally rains during early and late winters; snowfall during short mid winters 
    - Hence the warm current and related warm airmass has a major effect on climate and seasons giving four distinct seasons - warmer summers, milder autumn, short cold snowy winters and milder late winters i.e. spring
    - It is found in the British regions and hence called the British type climate; North-western Coastal America and Canada region; Southern Chile; Tasmanian Island and Southern New Zealand Islands

- - Vegetation:
    - The winter deciduous vegetation has evolved this way to protect itself from snow load over the short snow season and hence they shed the leaves in winter
    - So, in the British type climate, where we have a short snowfall season, we get winter deciduous vegetation which shed leaves during the winter season

##### Cold Temperate Continental Interior Regions:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 81.png>)

- - Extremely cold long winters and short warm summers due to high continentality
    - Precipitation will be less because of interior and snowy precipitation
    - Regions remain snow-covered for the major part of the year
    - Snow melts during short warm summers
    - Extremely cold winds like Blizzard blows here
    - Vegetation - Coniferous evergreen type of vegetation is grown here
        - Because the temperature remains below what is required to grow leaves.
    - These vegetation forests are called Taiga or Boreal Forests - found in the Siberian region of Eurasia/Lapland and in Northern Parts of Canada
    - Animals - Reindeer; very less biodiversity grows in these forests and hence very few types of trees
    - Mostly few varieties and hence called Pure Stand Forests exist here 
    - In Southern regions, we generally do not have such forests except for high altitude mountainous regions 
    - Such regions are called the Siberian Climatic Regions 
    - A special characteristic of coniferous trees are - such trees are softwood trees - also useful in the paper and pulp industry; synthetic fibres, etc (unlike Hardwood trees in tropical/hot regions)

##### Cold Temperate Eastern Margin Climatic Regions:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 82.png>)

- - It has a cold current on the coast due to which the region has relatively colder summers and very/extremely cold winters
    - Also, the coasts get frozen during winters and hence not easy to navigate with a lot of Fog on the coast 
    - This is pretty unlike the British type which remains navigable due to warm currents even during winters i.e. year-round navigability 
    - The European Coast warm currents keep even some ports in the Arctic Ocean navigable during winters such as the Port of Murmansk
    - Whereas, ports even around New York gets frozen during winters 
    - This cold temperate Eastern Margin Climate is broadly found around the Ekman Highlands of North America and North-Eastern Coastal Regions of China, Japan, Koreas, etc
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 28.jpeg>)

- - Hence, this climatic region is also known as the Laurentian type of climate
    - In the near coastal regions, some deciduous vegetation will be found but as one goes slightly interior into Laurentian climate then conifer vegetation starts 
    - We do not have a Laurentia climatic region in the southern hemisphere, because we do not have Eastern Coast Cold Current in a cold temperate region 

##### Polar/Arctic Climate:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 83.png>)

- - It has extremely cold long winters and short cold summers 
    - Almost all snowfall precipitation never generally fully melts and hence accumulate as ice 
    - This over a long period and mixes over polar oceans affecting the salinity of oceans 
    - Vegetation would generally be missing with some mosses and lichens growing and we might have some animals also like seals, penguins, etc 
    - This climatic region is found in Antarctic Continent in the Southern Hemisphere and the polar parts of Eurasia, Greenland, and North America 

# STRUCTURE OF THE OCEAN

- - The coastline of the country is the coastal land shape, whereas the baseline is the line connecting the outermost land points of the country, including the coastal islands, near the coast (not like Andaman & Nicobar, or Lakshadweep).
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 84.png>)
    - All the seawater between the coastline and the baseline is known as internal water, which is legally just like our land territory.
    - From the baseline, up to 12 nautical miles towards the ocean the region is known as the territorial waters of the country, and this is also considered legally the part of the country.
    - Another 12 nautical miles is called a contiguous zone.
    - Over the water, it is also considered as the region of the country.
    - But the difference between territorial water and the contiguous zone is that the national air space is considered only up to territorial water.
    - The air space over the contiguous zone is international air space.
    - The contiguous zone becomes the zone of giving warning to the incoming ships.
    - Beyond the contiguous zone, from the baseline up to 200 nautical miles, we have **Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).**
    - EEZ is the exclusive economic activity region such as fishing, mining, etc. of the country. Others can pass through such regions, and can have the right to peaceful passage.
    - Beyond the EEZ, the ocean surface region is known as the high sea, or open oceans, or international waters, and the seafloor is called the open ocean seafloor.
    - Generally, every country has the right of fishing in the international waters or move in the international waters.
    - The mining activity in the open ocean sea-bed can be done only with the permission of the International Seabed Authority, which is under the United Nations.
    - ISA was formed under the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Seas (UNCLOS).
    - If a country can geologically and scientifically prove that a country’s continental shelf extends even beyond nautical miles, then it can get exclusive mining rights only for an additional 150 nautical miles of the continental shelf.
    - This region will be known as the extended continental shelf of the country, where others can pass through and also fish. But mining activity will be done by the concerned country only.
    - Such geological proof is to be given to UNCLCS (United Nations Commission on the Limits of Continental Shelf), which is a body under the UNCLOS.
    - These classifications have become important also for laying international communication lines. And international pipelines in the ocean bed, which we cannot lay on the EEZ or continental shelf of a country without their permission.
    - In the continental margin regions, we generally get the resources, which have their source on the continents or formed during continent formation.

### MOVEMENT IN THE OCEANS AND THEIR CAUSES

- - Movements in oceans are mainly due to variation in temperature and salinity, which ultimately causes variations in _density_, and hence water having different densities tend to move differently.
    - For example, denser water tends to sink, whereas the lighter water tends to rise, and hence, they cause surface movements also.

##### Temperature variations in the ocean:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 85.png>)

- - Temperature varies in the ocean both horizontally, as well as vertically.

**Horizontally:**

- - Factors for temperature variation horizontally over the ocean surface are:
    - Latitude: As we go to higher latitudes, temperature decreases of the ocean surface.
    - Continentality & Maritime effect: Southern hemisphere has fewer continents, hence less temperature severing effect, or continentality effect during summers and winters.
    - Whereas in the Northern Hemisphere, the oceans are surrounded by bigger continents, hence more severe effects during winters and summers.
    - So northern hemisphere oceans are warmer in summers and cooler in winters as compared to the southern hemisphere.
    - Continentality: Semi-enclosed seas or oceans like the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Baltic Sea, Caribbean Sea, etc. have more continentality effect due to proximity and being partially enclosed by land bodies.
    - Ocean Currents: Cold current can keep waters colder in warmer regions whereas warm currents tend can keep the water warmer in colder regions.
    - Melting of glaciers and icebergs in the ocean: They make the oceans cooler.
    - For example- it is easier for the Antarctic region melted ice and glaciers to mix in the southern oceans, as there are relatively more open.
    - Whereas the ice and glacier melt for the arctic region does not easily get into the Northern Ocean, due to being landlocked.
    - Winds blowing over the sea: Warm winds make it warmer, and cool winds make the ocean surface water cooler.
    - The surface region of an ocean is generally considered up to a depth of around 400 meters.
    - The average temperature of the surface of the sea is around 27 degrees Celsius.
    - The surface temperature is affected by land temperature, and by the weather and climate of the region.
    - Also, the sunlight which is generally found to penetrate up to the top 400 meters of the ocean water keeps the region be bright and warm.
    - This region is known as the photic zone of the ocean, or the zone of light in the ocean.
    - As we go deeper into the ocean, the temperature of the ocean in the absence of sunlight, heat, and the absence of weather, climate, and seasons affect starts to get colder.
    - It is generally up to the depth of a thousand meters from the surface of the ocean.
    - Beyond this, is the deep ocean region, up to an average depth of 4500 meters, and the average temperature of the deep ocean is around 3-5 degrees Celsius.
    - The photic zone temperature of the equatorial tropic region is around 23-30 degrees.
    - In the temperate photic region, this might be around 13-14 degrees, whereas the polar and sub-polar photic region might be around 0-5 degrees.
    - Hence, in the polar sub-polar regions, the temperature does not decrease fast from the photic to the deep ocean region.
    - And hence, the polar, sub-polar oceanic regions do not have thermocline regions having fast temperature decrease, rather it has a constant temperature region of around 3-4 degrees Celsius.
    - The deep ocean water which is colder is generally denser, and generally, the surface water is warmer and lighter.

##### SALINITY

- - It simply refers to the salt concentration in the water body.
    - Near the mouths of the river where fresh water and saline water meets, the water will be brackish.

**Factors affecting the salinity:**

- - Horizontal layer the surface of the ocean, the salinity might decrease by the addition of freshwater, and it might increase by the evaporation of fresh water.
    - In the high continentality oceanic regions, the evaporation is high for example - near the coastal regions of tropical deserts, and hence salinity is high.
    - Similarly in semi-enclosed oceans or seas, the salinity is high due to less mixing with the open ocean.
    - It also depends on where the rivers are bringing the water, and how they are mixing.

**Vertical salinity:**

- - Most of the salt added in the ocean takes place on the surface of the ocean, and also the freshwater addition or removal also takes place on the surface of the ocean.
    - In the deeper ocean, salinity variation factors are not present.
    - Hence, the Deepwater salinity generally remains constant, while upper ocean salinity remains low and variable.
    - Especially in the photic zone where there is much movement in the ocean.
    - Deep ocean salinity is constant and high.
    - Also, the low salinity water is the lighter water, and the high salinity water is denser.
    - The region of fast change of salinity is called a halocline.

##### Density:

- - If we consider the density of the ocean vertically, due to both temperature and salinity, we find that normally both due to temperature and salinity, the surface water is lighter, and the deep ocean water is denser.
    - Hence, the final picture of the ocean density is: the deep ocean water is denser, whereas the surface water is lighter.

### MOVEMENTS OF THE OCEAN SURFACE

- - Density variation in the ocean can cause ocean waters to move from one region to the other, as many times, surface salinity might increase, making the surface water locally sink in the region and hence causing the complete circulation.
    - Similarly, movements on the surface of the ocean can also happen due to local winds which can create waves, and global surface winds such as trade winds, etc. which can create surface currents in the ocean.
    - Similarly, the gravity of the sun and moon can cause tidal movements in the ocean.
    - The density-related movements are mostly the biggest movements in the ocean, known as Thermohaline circulations.
        - Local winds - Waves
        - Global winds - Currents
        - The gravity of sun and moon - Tides
    - Density - Thermohaline circulations
    - Deep ocean currents are also due to density variations and surface currents.

##### Waves:

- - They are generally created due to the surface winds pushing the water in one direction.
    - Wind blowing in the same direction causes piling up and causes high waves, whereas simultaneous action of gravity on the high parts causes low waves.
    - This is the reason for the waves.

##### Tides:

- - Tides are generally created due to:
    - The gravitational attraction of the sun and moon, which is the gravitational force created tide.
    - Rotation of the earth causes a counterbalancing bulge on the other side of the earth, with respect to the gravitational force created by the tide.
    - Same way as if we extend one of our arms, and try to rotate, our body is trying to balance itself, extending the other arm in the other direction.
    - It creates a gravitational bulge on water, shown in the first figure, whereas the centrifugal bulge takes place on the other side of the earth, due to the earth’s rotation.
    - Hence the earth gets two bulges on both its sides.
    - These two bulges are known as high tides.
    - Because the total water on the earth’s oceans is constant, when two high bulges are created on the earth's oceans, at the same time, two depressions are also created 90 degrees longitudinally with respect to the high tides, which are called low tides.
    - Hence, the total result is that we get two high tides and two low tides 90 degrees to each other over the 360-degree longitude of the earth.
    - Because the earth rotates fully within 24 hours, hence all the coastal regions generally get high tides and low tides within a day.
    - During high tide, the coastal water gradually rises by some height, and the water dips by some height during low tide.
    - Some coastal regions get one high tide and one low tide in a day, and they are said to get diurnal tides.
    - Whereas some coastal regions get two high tides and two low tides in a day uniformly distributed over time. They are said to get semi-diurnal tides.
    - And some locations which get semi-diurnal tides have different heights of high tides and different depressions of low tides in a day.
    - They are said to get mixed semi-diurnal tides.
    - Hence all the coastal regions of the world can be divided broadly into these three categories.
    - This is mainly due to the irregular shapes of the coast, and hence irregular bouncing of the tides from the coasts and mixing, as the earth continuously rotates.
    - High tides and low tides generally hit the coasts generally at nearly fixed times during the day, and are very predictable.

**NEAP TIDES AND SPRING TIDES**

- - The moon revolves around the earth in 27 days, or nearly a month, hence nearly every fortnight, the moon, earth, and sun are in the same line, and another fortnight later or earlier, the moon and the sun are at 90 degrees with respect to the earth.
    - When the earth, moon, and the sun are in a line, the gravitational force and centrifugal force due to sun, moon and earth’s rotation are also in a line, and hence the tidal bulge pair of the moon and the sun are also in the same line and hence they add up.
    - The result is bigger than normal tides on these days of the month.
    - So on the first and last days of the month, the high tides will be higher than normal, and the low tide will be lower than normal.
    - We call these two days spring tide days, which occur on the new moon day(the next day after the new moon), and on the fortnight later on the full moon day.

**Neap Tide:**

- - When the moon and sun are at 90 degrees to the earth; the first quarter and third quarter days, separated by a fortnight.
    - One first quarter and third quarter day, we see a half-moon in the sky.
    - The moon bee closer to the earth has a more gravitational effect on the earth, and hence, the moon’s tidal bulge and depression bulge are bigger
    - Because the sun is farther from the earth, hence its gravitational effect on the earth is lesser than that of the moon.
    - Hence, the tidal bulge and depression due to the sun are lesser.
    - We should also remember the tidal bulge and depression due to any of these are at 90 degrees longitudinally and alternatively to each other.
    - The tidal bulges due to the moon will be on the line of the moon and the earth, whereas the tidal depressions of the moon (low tide) will be at 90 degrees with the moon and the earth. It will be similar for the sun also.

- - It is a weaker high tide as well as, on the same day, a weaker low tide.
    - Because the low tides and the high tides occur simultaneously at a place, we get a resultant weaker low tide due to the moon.
    - At the same time, 90 degrees is longitudinally away on the earth, we will simultaneously get a bigger high tide of the moon and a lesser low tide of the sun, hence the resultant will be a weaker high tide due to the moon.
    - This way, in these days (first quarter and third quarter) we get weaker high tides and weaker low tides on the earth known as neap tides.
    - Hence, it can be said that every day the coastal locations get a high tide or low tides, depending on, whether they are diurnal or not, depending on whether it is the new moon or the full moon day of the earth.
    - All the coastal locations on that day will get spring tides, which are bigger than normal high tides and low tides.
    - And if it is the first quarter or third quarter day of the month (half-moon days) get neap tides, which are smaller than normal high tides and low tides.

**EFFECTS OF TIDES**

- - Tides play a major role in accumulating or removing sediments on the coast, along with the waves and the currents.
    - If more deposition is done on the coast than removal by tides, currents, and waves, we call such coasts are coasts of deposition.
    - Whereas if more erosion happens than deposition, we call them coasts of erosion.
    - Tides also create a partly submerged region on the coast on a daily basis, known as the intertidal region. Such regions have their own intertidal ecosystems.
    - Tides also give us tidal ports at the mouths of the river.
    - During high tides, the channel of the river becomes wider and bigger ships can move in like the Hooghly port at the mouth of the Ganga.
    - We also use tides for generating tidal energy which is a renewable source of energy.

##### Ocean Currents

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 87.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 88.png>)

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 89.png>)

- - Currents are long-distance, large, slow-moving unidirectional movement in the oceans, nearly round the year.
    - They are of two types: the surface zone currents found in the photic zone (up to 400 meters), and we also have deep ocean currents which are found in the deeper part of the ocean below the photic zone.
    - The main causes for the currents are:
        - Sun’s heating: causes variation in temperature and density.
        - Salinity: Causes variation in temperature and density.
        - Gravity: Making water sink from the surface, hence other surface region layer moves to that region where water has sunken.
        - Surface global winds
        - Coriolis force
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 90.png>)

**Ocean Surface Currents**

- - Different **causes** of ocean currents include -
        - The global surface winds also called the planetary winds
        - Density variation due to variation in temperature and salinity
        - The effect of gravity
        - The effect of Coriolis force.

- - **How currents are created?**
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 91.png>)

- - Explained with the help of a diagram.
        - Current number 1, flows from tropical east to tropical west and the cause is trade wind.
        - Current number 2, flows from equatorial west to equatorial east and the cause is doldrums (lack of strong trade wind to oppose it).
        - Current number 3, flows from tropical to temperate parallel to the east coast of the western continent. The cause is trade wind which pushes it to move along coasts.
        - Current number 4, flows from western warm temperate to eastern cool temperate, the cause is westerlies.
        - Current number 5, flows from the cool temperate west coast of the eastern continent to the tropical equatorial west coast of the eastern continent. Coriolis force creates this current.
        - Part of the current number 4 leads to the creation of number 5 due to Coriolis force as shown. The remaining part of 4 hits the cool temperate western coast of the eastern continent and partly goes towards 5, strengthening it, and partly goes towards pole creating current number 6.
        - Current number 6, flows from the cool temperate west coast of the eastern continent to the polar west coast of the eastern continent. It is created due to the collision of current number 4 along the coast leading to bifurcation.
        - Current number 7, flows from the polar region to parallel to the eastern coast of the western continent towards the temperate region. The cause is polar easterlies.
        - These are major round the year ocean surface currents in different hemispheres..
    - **Northern pacific currents -**
        - Current number 1 - Northern equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 - Kuroshio current 
        - Current number 4 - North Pacific Drift
        - Current number 5 - California current
        - Current number 6 - Alaska current
        - Current number 7 - Oyashio current
    - **Southern Pacific Ocean currents -**
        - Current number 1 - South equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 - Eastern Australian current
        - Current number 4 - West Wind Drift
        - Current number 5 - Humboldt current (Peruvian)
        - Current number 6 - there is no equivalent of current no. 6 in the south pacific as south America does not extend much towards the polar region.
        - Current number 7 - similarly, there is no equivalent of current no. 7 in the south pacific as Australia also does not extend much towards the polar region.
    - **Southern Atlantic Ocean currents -**
        - Current number 1 - South equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 -  Brazilian current
        - Current number 4 - West Wind Drift
        - Current number 5 - Benguela current
        - Current number 6 - Not present
        - Current number 7 - Falkland current
    - **Southern Indian ocean currents -**
        - Current number 1 - South equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 - Agulhas current
        - Current number 4 - West Wind Drift
        - Current number 5 - West Australian Current
        - Current number 6 - No equivalent current
        - Current number 7 - No equivalent current
    - In the **North Atlantic Ocean**, because the coastline of this ocean is highly irregular and broken, hence, identifying the current as per our rule becomes slightly difficult. Hence, the different currents in North Atlantic as per our rule are -
        - Current number 1 - North equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 - Gulf stream and Florida current (Gulf stream is named after the Gulf of Mexico)
        - Current number 4 - Northern part of Gulf stream and Northern Atlantic Drift
        - Current number 5 - Canaries current
        - Current number 6 - Northern part of North Atlantic Drift and Norwegian current (formed by bifurcation at British island)
        - Current number 7 - two currents - Erminger current and Labrador current.

**Implications of Ocean currents**

- - The currents affect the temperature and precipitation of different regions and hence, make a region cold/warm or wet/dry. I.e. current number 7 keeps the coast very cold like the Laurentian type of climate. Current number 6 keeps the coast warm like the British type of climate. Current number 5 (cold) keeps the western tropical coast region dry and desert type (tropical deserts). And current number 3 keeps tropical coasts wet and warm like the tropical marine climate.
    - Here, it should be noted that any current moving within the equatorial tropical region like current numbers 1&2 or moving from low latitude to high latitude like current numbers 3,4 & 6 are called warm currents. Whereas, currents moving from high latitude to low latitude like 5&7 are called cold currents.
    - When warm and cold currents meet and mix like 3 and 7 meeting along the east coast, they raise nutrients from the continental shelf and make fish available, hence, making it a good fishing coast, generally called as fishing banks, good for commercial fishing.
    - The whole circulation of the currents in the ocean is known as oceanic gyres, which are large horizontal circular motions on surfaces. Many times gyres trap material within them not allowing them to move outside the gyre as they keep floating on the ocean surface. The best example of such trapped material is the Sargasso Sea.

**Thermohaline circulation**

- - The thermohaline circulation is the circulation created in the ocean mainly due to the variation in temperature and salinity and hence, their related outcome i.e. the variation in density.
    - Hence, due to density variation in the ocean the denser water sinks to the bottom, and this way a large circulation is initiated in the ocean, involving the surface region, the deep ocean region as well as the vertical regions of the ocean.
    - The circulation so created in the global ocean starts mainly due to the freezing of the surface water in the polar North Atlantic region, where, surface water tends to freeze and the salt part is slightly released to the slightly sub-surface region which makes the sub-surface water denser and hence it sinks to the deep ocean.
    - In the deep ocean, this water moves from North Atlantic to the South Atlantic, and simultaneously on the surface water moves from the South Atlantic to the North Atlantic to compensate for the sunken water.
    - This way a global circulation is started, where, the South Atlantic deep ocean cold water further continues to the deep ocean regions of the Northern Indian Ocean and Northern Pacific Ocean. 
    - These waters upwell due to continental barriers in North Indian Ocean and North Pacific and simultaneously the warm surface water of North Indian Ocean and North Pacific continue to flow gradually, finally towards North Atlantic as shown.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 92.png>)

- - This way the whole thermohaline circulation is completed.
    - Another subpart of the thermohaline circulation is a partial circulation between the Arctic and the Antarctic region covering the whole Atlantic only known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Which is the thermohaline circulation of the Atlantic Ocean.
    - These thermohaline circulations as discussed above, have large-scale implications on the global climate and seasons, and also they affect the various ecosystems of marine and coastal ecosystems. 
    - The way Headly, Ferrel, and Polar cells play a major role in heat transfer in the atmosphere, similarly, the thermohaline circulation is the largest circulation in the ocean, having the largest implication in heat transfer in the oceans.
    - Thermohaline circulation takes around 1000 years to complete one full circulation in the global oceans, hence these are slow circulation. Which will have long-term implications on the global climate like climate change if these circulations are adversely affected.

### Corals and Reef related formations

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 93.png>)

- - Coral reefs are generally a widespread formation over the continental shelf comprising of multiple coloured things as we generally know them.
    - When we look closely, we find that coral reefs have a living and a non-living part to them.
    - The living part includes the polyps (coral polyps), and zooxanthellae(algae) if they are found.
    - Whereas some polyps form calcium compound deposits called the reef which are hard stone-like structures or platforms on which the reef-forming polyps live.
    - Polyps are simple animals that are tube-like structures, generally transparent or translucent and they are **sessile**, which means, they remain fixed to a surface for their lifetime like plants.
    - The polyps can further be of two types - the **Hermatypic** (calcium carbonate deposit forming reefs aka hard corals) and the **Ahermatypic** (non-reef-forming polyps aka Soft corals).

**Hermatypic Corals**

- - Build calcium coral deposits (Reefs) throughout life.
    - They live in huge groups, their collective formations are called coral reef colonies.
    - Every generation builds its own reef layer as older layers go on eroding.
    - Because they need calcium compounds for building reefs, hence, they can live in saline water only. Not in freshwater, not in even brackish water (less saline i.e. at the mouth of a river).
    - They do not make their own food and hence depend for their food on another organism called zooxanthellae, which is a photosynthesizing algae. This means zooxanthellae can make food in the presence of sunlight and can provide food to hermatypic corals.
    - Hence, these algae live inside the bodies of the polyps themselves.
    - These zooxanthellae look like the coloured things inside corals, making corals colourful.
    - Because now the polyps have to ensure that they live in the photic zone for the sunlight for the zooxanthellae and also they need a platform to grow on in ocean waters, hence, hermatypic corals mostly grow on the continental shelf and submerged photic regions of islands. Also, they have to ensure sunlight round the year, for food, hence, they live in tropical regions only.
    - In these regions, the water is generally warm more than 20 deg. Hence, they have evolved into warm water coral and cannot survive in cold water regions.
    - Hence, because generally, the tropical western coast of the continent has cold waters due to cold current, the coral reefs are not found on the tropical western coast generally. But there are exceptions like the Indian western coast. Because the western coast of India does not get any cold current, hence coral reefs are found even on the western coast of India.
    - Because they need sunlight regularly, they cannot survive in unclear water as the suspended particles will block the sunlight. Hence, corals grow only in clear water and not in muddy/polluted water.
    - Some of the big and more populated warm water coral regions include - the Australian Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Triangle of Southeast Asia including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea.
    - In India, the coral reefs are found mainly in five regions - Andaman & Nicobar, Gulf of Munnar, Lakshadweep, Malvan, and Gulf of Kutch in Gujarat.

- - **Reef Formations**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 94.png>)

- - There are mainly three types of reef formations -
        - The Fringing reef
        - The Barrier reef
        - The Atoll reef

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 95.png>)

- - Fringing reefs generally grow near the coastal region around the continents or islands on the submerged coastal regions. Generally, reefs start growing this way.
    - Over a period, as the water between the fringing reef and the coast gets polluted and gets less suitable for polyps to grow due to lack of mixing with the open ocean because now the reefs act as a hindrance, the newer polyps tend to grow on the outward side (seaward side) hence, the reefs start growing farther from the fringing reef, many times up to 100s of times away from the continental shelves. These are known as barrier reefs like the Great barrier reef of Australia. 
    - Over a period, it might happen that the island around which they started growing might submerge due to tectonic activity whereas the polyps continue to grow in the photic zone and marine deposits or erosional material might be deposited over these reefs, making them into some kind of islands themselves. These are known as Atoll islands e.g. atoll islands of Lakshadweep and Maldives.

**Coral Bleaching**

- - Bleaching simply means becoming colourless. This happens when the zooxanthellae separate from the polyps. 
    - This separation happens under environmental stress of the surrounding in which the corals are living and shows the discomfort of the corals to this changing environment.
    - These changes include undesired changes in temperature (very cold/warm), salinity (less/high), too much pollution of water, too much turbulence due to tourism/transport.
    - If such environmental stress becomes too much, initially the corals bleach and finally they might die as a colony, degrading the whole coral ecosystem which is not good for the marine ecosystem. Because coral reefs are the most biodiversity-rich ecosystems in the oceans supporting a huge variety of other marine plants and animals. And because of this support, they are compared with and also called the rainforests of the oceans as rainforests on land also support huge biodiversity.

**Ahermatypic Corals**

- - These are polyps that do not excrete or release calcium carbonate deposits and hence do not build reefs or coral reef formations made up of calcium carbonate. 
    - Rather, they stick themselves to the floors of the ocean, and from these floors, they directly collect their food from the passing water which is generally rich in nutrients.
    - This also means that these corals do not depend on zooxanthellae for food and hence, don’t have to live in the photic zone. Therefore, they survive on the deep ocean floors. Which are the dark cold regions of the ocean. Hence, Ahermatypic corals are also called **cold-water corals**.
    - And because they don’t form hard calcium carbonate deposits, also called **soft corals**.
    - More than 4200 species of soft corals have been found in different regions such as deep coastal regions in Antarctica, Australia, Canada, Norway, New Zealand, the US, and the UK.
    - These are also found in the relatively tropical zones but in the deep cold oceans e.g. in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal region cold-water corals are found along with the hermatypic, reef-building corals.
    - The ahermatypic corals found in these Indian Ocean regions include - Black coral, organ pipe coral, fire corals, 
    - They can also be found in shallow waters as well.

**Dead Zones**

- - Also called hypoxia zones
    - It could be natural or man-made.
    - Natural dead zones e.g. Lower region of the Black Sea. Because water does not mix properly in that region and hence oxygen from the atmosphere could not be carried to the lower parts. So animals and plants are not able to survive in these zones.
    - Natural Eutrophication - because of which oxygen does not mix well in lower parts and the mixed oxygen in the water is consumed creating a dead zone.
    - Human activity - Agriculture waste such as nitrogen and phosphorus-rich chemicals into the oceans can cause hypoxia via eutrophication. Industrial waste can also cause this e.g. large dead zones have been created in the Gulf of Mexico region due to human-induced waste being released. Similarly, the Baltic Sea also has dead zones. There are around 415 dead zones across the globe in oceans. Also, large dead zones have been found in the Arabian sea along the Indian coastline due to chemical release.
