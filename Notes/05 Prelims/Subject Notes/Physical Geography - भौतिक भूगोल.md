# EARTH

- - Planets outside our solar system are called exoplanets.
    - The temperature on earth is favourable for allowing an atmosphere to exist.
    - Allow H2O (Water) to exist in liquid, gas, and solid (physical state).
    - The liquid and gaseous states are very important for life to exist. 
    - The atmosphere and water vapour in the air make the planet habitable.
    - Hence, when we try to find or look for other planets in the universe which are habitable or where we can find life as we understand.

##### Goldilocks Zone

- - The range of distance from the star which have attributes of being habitable.(The range of distance with the right temperatures for water to remain liquid)
    - Planets found in the goldilocks zone have the possibility that life could exist on such planets. 
    - But habitable zones are not a surety in themselves that they would support life.
    - Earth lies in the habitable zone with respect to the sun and hence it is important. 

### Important aspects with respect to earth

#### _The shape of the earth_

- - If the earth would not have been rotating its shape would have been sphere.  
    - An oblate spheroid is the real shape of the rotating earth. 
    - The right shape is needed for observation and scientific purposes. 
    - The geoid is basically a term used for the shape of the earth formed by the surfaces of land and water bodies where the gravitational effect (tides in the ocean) is not considered.
    - The real name of the shape of the earth is geoid.

#### _Major movements of the earth_

- - As part of the milky way galaxy, the earth is moving along with the galaxy. (19-21 lakh km/hour)
    - As a part of the solar system moving along with the sun as the sun revolves around the centre of the milky way galaxy (8.25 lakh km/hour).
    - Revolution around the sun (1.1 lakh km/hour). 
    - Rotation on its own axis. 

#### _Minor movements_

**Axial tilt and obliquity**

- - The earth tends to change its angle of tilt between 22.1 degrees to 24.5 degrees and then come back to 22.1 degrees. 
    - This whole cycle takes around 41000 years. 

**Precession or circling of the top of the axis of the earth.** 

- - Circling of the top and bottom of the axis takes around 26000 years for one precession movement. 

**Eccentricity**

- - Earth's axis of the revolution itself tends to change its shape and path and hence after doing numerous such eccentric revolutions the earth comes back to its previous revolution path.
    - The eccentricity is mainly due to the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn and they have a cycle of 1 lakh year to 4 lakh 13000 years.

These 3 minor movements together are also known as the **Milankovitch cycle**.

##### Effects of movements of the earth

- - The movement along with the galaxy and along with the sun does not have any perceptible or felt the effect on us.
    - The Revolution of the earth on a tilted axis does give us the effect of the seasons of the year. 
    - Hence, the concept of the year. 
    - Rotation of the earth gives us day and night and hence a 24 hour day and night concept.
    - Rotation on a tilted axis gives us the concept of different durations of day and night during different parts of the year. 
    - Minor movements basically cause long-term natural climate change on the earth like the ice age.

**Axial Tilt**

- - Tilt respective to a plane of revolution is 66.5 degrees. 
    - The tilt of the axis of revolution with respect to the vertical is 23.5 degrees. 
    - But, this tilt does not remain constant always. 
    - It changes between 22.1 degrees up to 24.5 degrees and then back to 22.1 degrees in a cyclic manner over a period of 41000 years. 
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 1.png>)

**Precession**

- - The slow movement of the axis of a spinning body around another axis due to a torque (such as gravitational influence) acting to change the direction of the first axis. 
    - The pole star keeps changing after every 13000 years.
    - The Pole star now is Polaris. 
    - Pole star after 13000 years will be, Vega.

### Major features of the earth

**Latitudes and longitudes**

- - These are man-made lines of imaginary lines.
    - We make latitudes and longitudes, to mark and know exactly the location of any place. 
    - Same way as we use graph paper X and Y-axis to know the location of a point on the graph paper.

**Latitude**

- - When we keep the earth vertical with respect to the axis of rotation then the horizontal circles made on the earth's surface are known as latitudes.
    - As a standard, the biggest horizontal circle made in the middle of such a position of the earth is called the equator. 
    - The Equator is considered zero degrees latitude. 
    - With respect to the plane of the equator, we find that the poles where the axis of rotation passes through the earth are at an angle of 90 degrees. 
    - Poles are located at 90 degrees. The north pole is 90 degrees north and the south pole is 90 degrees south. 
    - Hence all the other circles are measured with respect to the plane of the equator.
    - Latitudes at 23.5 degrees are known as tropics - Tropic of cancer (23.5 North) and tropic of Capricorn (23.5 South). 
    - Latitudes at 66.5 North is called Arctic circle and 66.5 south is called the Antarctic circle.
    - Every 1- degree latitude is 111 km apart though this distance also does not always remain the same because the earth's surface is not perfectly circular and hence as we go from the equator to the pole this 111 km approximately also keeps increasing slightly.

**Longitude**

- - When we draw a semi-circle from one pole to the other pole on the earth's surface.
    - This semi-circle is called longitude.
    - As many distinct semi-circles that we can draw this way on the earth's surface from pole to pole are the different longitudes that we get.
    - The standard longitude for the whole earth with respect to which other longitudes are measured and named is known as the prime meridian.
    - The prime meridian is passing through the royal observatory Greenwich England.
    - When we complete the prime meridian circle on the other side and considering the prime meridian as zero degrees the other side semi circle becomes 180 degrees.
    - Roughly, this 180-degree longitude is known as the international dateline which passes over the pacific ocean. 
    - Hence giving as zero degree and 180-degree longitudes.
    - All the other longitudes East of the Prime meridian up to the 180 - degree longitude are numbered with respect to their angle from the zero degrees latitude and known as east longitudes.
    - For example - a longitude located at an angle of 5 degrees with respect to the prime meridian will be known as 5 degrees east longitude and so on up to 180 degrees. 
    - Similarly, longitudes on the west of the prime meridian are similarly named as west longitudes.
    - The distance between longitudes at the equator is approx. 111 km and at poles, the distance is zero km. 
    - When we see this 111 km distance between for every degree of latitude and longitude and for higher precession when we want to further divide every degree of latitude or longitudes we use the system of 1- degree angle = 60 minutes of angle.
    - Hence every one minute is approximately 2 km.

**Major features on the earth with atlas**

- - The major physical features in the physical map.
    - The ocean floor is the land below the oceans.
    - Continent - land above the ocean. 
    - On the land above the ocean, features are mountains, plateaus, and plains. 
    - On the ocean - mountains are called mid-oceanic ridges.
    - For plains in the ocean, we will have a basin. 
    - For plateaus, the word high will be used sometimes in oceans. 
    - The ocean maps, oceanic shelves are the shallow land near the coast having a depth of few meters to up to 300 meters. 
    - Green regions are plains closer to sea level. Darker the green, closer they are to the sea. 
    - Brown coloured regions are higher regions in the physical map, the darker the brown the higher the place
    - In the ocean, the darker shades mean deeper regions, and light blue means shallow regions.
    - Desserts are shown in yellow colours.
    - Basins in the continent are generally the plains formed or affected by rivers.
    - Many times even the mountainous areas through which such rivers flow are considered as part of the basin.
    - Sea is the region of the ocean near the land or continent that was given a local name to distinguish it or mark it within the larger ocean.
    - **Peninsula** is with respect to the continent. The land surrounded by water from 3 sides is called a peninsula.
    - **Bay or gulf** is water which is surrounded by land by 3 sides.
        - Bays: Generally smaller and shallower indentations compared to gulfs. They provide some shelter from the open ocean but are not as deeply cut into the landmass.
    - **Isthmus**, a strip of land connecting two landmasses. Ex- Isthmus of Panama.
    - **Strait or channel**, a water body/strip of water connecting two bigger water bodies.
    - The **cape** is the tip of the peninsula.

**Revolution of earth and its effects on the earth**

- - Earth's tilt remains constant with respect to the plane of revolution and the vertical plane of revolution in the direction of the pole star, Polaris at present but the most important thing to note here is that the earth's tilt with respect to the sun is not constant.
    - In a year on two days first around 21st September and 2nd around 21st march is known as equinox days.
    - The earth's tilt with respect to the sun is zero which simply means neither the north pole nor the south pole is tilted towards or away from the sun and is rather equidistant from the sun on these two days.
    - Though throughout the revolution, the earth is tilted towards the pole star.
    - On equinox days, the earth's tilt with respect to the sun is zero degrees.
    - On two other days of the year known as the solstice days on 21st June and 21st December, the earth is so tilted while orbiting around the sun and pointing towards the pole star that it is maximum tilted with respect to the sun also. 
    - Around the 21st June solstice, this tilt is 23.5 degrees with respect to the sun so that the northern hemisphere of the earth is tilted towards the sun and the southern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun.
    - Around 21st December the earth is again tilted with respect to the sun at 23.5 degrees which is the maximum tilt with respect to the sun but on this day, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun and the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun.
    - On solstice days, the earth has a tilt of a maximum of 23.5 degrees but in different solstices the direction of tilt is opposite.

#### _EFFECT OF EARTH REVOLUTION ON TILTED AXIS_

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 3.png>)

**Circle of Illumination**

- - It is an imaginary circle on the earth, so that side of the earth towards the sun is illuminated and the side of the earth away from the sun is dark.
    - It is always a vertical circle over the earth.
    - No matter whether the earth is tilted or not with respect to the sun during the different parts of the year. 
    - Only on the equinox days when the earth is not tilted with respect to the sun.
    - On the solstice days, the sunray falls vertical at a point 23.5 degrees north of the equator.
    - The latitude passing through this point is 23.5 degrees North latitude hence simply said on the June solstice the sunray falls vertical at places located on 23.5 degrees North latitude as the earth rotates.
    - Similarly, in the December solstice, the Northern hemisphere will be tilted away and the southern hemisphere will be tilted towards the sun hence on this day, the sunray falling perpendicular to the earth's surface will be located 23.5 degrees south of the equator.
    - Hence, on this day, all places on 23.5 degrees south latitude will receive the sunray perpendicular over them.
    - Simply said, on the march and September equinoxes the sunrays fall perpendicular over the equator whereas, on the June and December solstice days, the sun rays fall perpendicular over the 23.5 degrees North and south respectively.
    - Hence, we can say that the sun never goes beyond 23.5 degrees latitude.

**Seasons and day and night changes**

- - The real reason for the seasons is not the distance but the tilt wrt the sun during the diff parts of the year.
    - Because of the tilt with respect to the sun, the hemisphere tilted towards the sun receives more sunlight whereas the hemisphere tilted away from the sun receives less part of the sunlight. 
    - As we can understand, from the may solstice diagram, that as we move from the equator towards the 90 degrees north pole, the length of daylight goes on increasing with an increase in latitude and the duration of night respectively goes on decreasing.
    - At 66.5 North degree latitude, we find that it is fully on the daylight side hence having 24-hour daylight on this day (may solstice) and hence no night.
    - Further, all the higher latitude circles will be on the daylight side and would also be experiencing 24-hour daylight including the poles. 
    - On the other hand, on this June solstice day, as one travels from the equator towards the south pole 90 degrees south, with an increase in latitude, the duration of daylight goes on decreasing whereas the duration of the night goes on increasing because this hemisphere is experiencing the winter season. 
    - When one reaches the 66.5 degrees south latitude circle, we find that it is experiencing a 24 hour night as no part of the circle goes toward the illuminated side hence the length of daylight is zero hours.
    - The same phenomenon is observed for higher latitudes here also up to 90 degrees south. 
    - The phenomena of 24 hours daylight or 24 night are generally related to the poles but here we find that it starts from the 66.5 degrees latitude circle itself.
    - Hence, these 66.5 degrees latitudes are known as polar circles.
    - The north pole experiences 6-month daylight from 21st march till 21st September.
    - During this period south pole experienced 24 hours 6 months nights.
    - From 21st September Equinox till 21st march equinox, the north poles experience 24 hours 6 month night whereas the south pole experiences 24 hours 6-month daylight.
    - The date of equinox and solstice does not always remain the same and they keep changing from 19th to 22nd/ 23rd. 
    - In terms of the sunlight, the cycle goes like dark in the night and then dawn when the sun just rises and then daylight, then dusk and then evening twilight and then the darkness of the night again. 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Latitude|24-hour day/Night|
|90|6 months|
|80|more days < 6 months|
|70|fewer days > 1|
|66.5|1 day|

**ROTATION OF EARTH**

- - 24 hours is the time taken for places on any given longitude to complete a full rotation with respect to the sun. 
    - In terms of angles, there are 360-degree longitudes on the earth, and hence the time gap between one-degree longitude the time difference will be 4 minutes. 
    - The time on our planet is kept with respect to the different longitudes for different countries.
    - The standard time for the world is calculated with respect to the time at Greenwich at zero longitudes of the prime meridian.
    - As the earth rotates from west to east hence the eastern longitudes experience sunrise before Greenwich longitude or the western longitudes. 
    - All the longitudes east of Greenwich longitudes are called east longitudes. 
    - 180 degrees is called the international dateline.

**Time Zone**

- - The standard time is calculated from zero degrees prime meridian. 
    - We will gain 4 minutes with each degree moving east and lose 4 minutes with each degree west. 
    - Indian is 5 hours 30 minutes ahead of Greenwich prime meridian time. 
    - India's longitude is **82.5** degrees east of Greenwich and India's standard timeline.

- - A time zone is an area that observes a uniform standard time for legal, commercial, and social purposes.
    - Time zones tend to follow the boundaries between countries and their subdivisions instead of strictly following longitude because it is convenient for areas in frequent communication to keep the same time.
    - India has only a one-time zone.
    - The country has officially observed India Standard Time (IST) 82.5 degrees east since 1947.
    - There are ongoing demands for 2 time zones in India.
    - India is geographically the second-largest country not to have multiple time-zones
    - India stretches from 97 degrees 25 minutes East in Arunachal to 68 degrees 7 minutes East in Gujarat — almost 30 degrees of longitude which is more than enough to have two time zones.
    - Northeast lose important daylight which can be used productively as the sun rises as early as 4 am in summer and offices open at 10.
    - Many people in India operate in a time zone that is not an appropriate diurnal cycle for them.

**Daylight time**

- - Countries that are in higher latitudes generally experience varying lengths of daylight during summers and winters to make out or to gain maximum from available sunlight during the day.
    - Some countries follow the practice of daylight saving time.
    - Here, when the winters get over (during the spring season) they set their clocks one hour ahead.
    - This way as per their clock, they get one hour of sunlight in the evening. 
    - Then, when the summers get over (during the autumn season) they again set back their clock to the previous normal time.
    - This way during their productive seasons they get one extra hour of sunlight as per their clock.

**Solar and lunar eclipse**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 4.png>)

- - When the sun is shadowed by the moon so the sun is not visible - Solar eclipse.
    - When the moon is shadowed by earth blocking sunlight is lunar eclipse.
    - Diamond Ring phenomenon is observed along the peripheral region of the totality trail.
    - The orbit of the revolution of the moon is tilted slightly with respect to the orbit of the revolution of the earth(5.1°). 
    - Because of this mostly even when -
        - A) Even if the moon is between the sun and the earth;
        - B) The earth is between the sun and the moon, the shadow of the moon or earth does not fall on the other (on earth or moon).
    - Few times in a year, the planes of the orbit of earth and moon are so positioned along with the positions of the earth and moon that the earth, moon, and sun all fall in the same line. 
    - Here, the sequence of earth and moon with respect to the sun will decide which kind of eclipse we will get. 
        - A) If the sequence in the line is sun-moon-earth, the shadow of the moon will fall on the earth's surface and at such places on the earth's surface, the sun will not be visible, hence experiencing the solar eclipse.
        - B) If in the line the sequence is sun-earth-moon, that the shadow of the earth will fall on the moon and hence it will be seen as a lunar eclipse.

**Formation of different layers of regions of the earth**

- - The formation of the solar system started approximately 8.5 billion years before the present from the supernova explosion of the protosun (precursor star of the sun).
    - The stellar nebula was formed.
    - This initial earth had an atmosphere made up of the leftover hydrogen and helium gas since the earth's formation.
    - This atmosphere was known as the first atmosphere of the earth.

- - But, at that time, the earth was hot, the sun was also in its initial phases and hence the first atmosphere of the earth was blown away because -

A) The gases were too light.

B)  The sun's heat was able to blow them away.

- - Around 4.4 billion years before the present, the earth had a major collision known as the big splat or giant impact with another relatively half-sized planet, mentioned in some sources, Theia.
    - From this collision, we got 2 things - The present earth and the present moon of earth.
    - The earth so formed this time was having a hot, molten surface so formed made up of lava.
    - Gradually, from such hot molten surfaces, as more eruptions rose, it released gases like ammonia, hydrogen, helium, water, carbon dioxide, methane, rocky material, dust, ash, etc.
    - The gases so released went on to envelope or cover the molten earth forming the second atmosphere of the earth.
    - Mostly rich in carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia but not in nitrogen or oxygen.
    - The second atmosphere also had H2O as water vapor which went on to form clouds as more and more gases erupted.
    - These clouds started causing rains which happened for millions of years, eventually leading to the cooling of the earth's surface and the formation of global oceans, covering the whole earth. 
    - Hence, before 4 billion years before the present, the earth already had a second atmosphere and a global ocean covering the whole earth.
    - Simultaneously the earth's molten surfaces were also gradually cooling over these millions of hundreds of years. 
    - As earth lost its heat to space and was also gradually cooled by global oceans.
    - Hence, as the molten minerals cooled and solidified, they led to the formation of rocks, over periods, the rocks led to the formation of a rocky layer below the oceans as a rocky ocean floor.
    - This way the oceans floors were formed as a rocky surface the way we know them presently. 
    - This way the first rocky surface was formed below the oceans.

**Formation of continents and Islands**

- - The ocean rocky floor doesn't remain forever once formed, rather it sinks back partly into the molten interior and again melts so that the lighter rocky molten part tends to rise again through volcanic eruptions.
    - When such lighter material solidifies, it initially leads to the formation of Islands.
    - When many such Islands get together they lead to the formation of continents.
    - This is how gradually, Islands and continents also started forming.
    - Such formations started appearing on the earth's surface around 4 billion years before the present.
    - Hence, this way around 4 billion years before present, the earth had;

A) The second atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia.

B) A global ocean covering most of the earth.

C) Islands and some initial continents.

- - But still, our present atmosphere is rich in O2 and N2 was still to form.
    - Also, at that time, there was nearly no life on earth.

**Evolution of life and present atmosphere (third atmosphere)**

- - Around 3.8 billion years before the present, single-cell life forms evolved on the earth.
    - Most probably it was in the ocean (as per some current sources, life evolved earlier than 4 billion years before the present).
    - For the evolution of life, along with the other physical atmospheric conditions like temperature, moisture presence of some chemicals are also necessary such as phosphorus, sulphur, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc.
    - They gave us nucleic acid and amino acids which are required for life forms and protein formation.
    - These are complex compounds, and these require reactions and these reactions are not easy to occur on land (solid or gaseous medium).
    - They need a liquid medium for easy formation. 
    - For the formation of life single-cell life forms, the required conditions were most probably fulfilled in the oceans different chemicals were present in the oceans dissolved from the atmosphere, brought down by the rains to the oceans, or dissolved from the ocean floor rocks.
    - The required energy for such life-forming reactions was provided by lightning from the sky during rains or volcanic eruptions over the ocean floors. 
    - This way as per the most accepted life evolution theories, life evolved on the earth as single-cell life forms around 3.8 billion years before present either near the top surface of the ocean or at the bottom surface of the oceans due to volcanoes. 
    - But, these life forms neither required too much oxygen nor produced too much oxygen. 
    - Photosynthesising bacteria's evolved in the oceans around 3 billion to 2.5 billion years before the present.
    - Gradually the photosynthesizing organisms led to making the oceans saturated with the oxygen around 2000 million years before present and gradually this oxygen started leaking into the atmosphere as simultaneously the other gases were being dissolved and taken to oceans.
    - Hence, slowly, more complex living forms evolved as the atmosphere was also evolving gradually into an oxygen-rich atmosphere.
    - Around 530 million years before present life started to creep from the oceans to the land in the coastal areas as the atmosphere was now rich in oxygen to support such life and gradually more and more photosynthesizing life forms evolved and spread over the land, they absorbed more of CO2  from the atmosphere and released more of O2 into the atmosphere.
    - This way the present third atmosphere having negligible CO2 and substantial O2 was formed.
    - Throughout these reactions, when nitrogen gas was being released, it being a relatively non-reactive gas, it accumulate more and more in the atmosphere.
    - This is how finally the earth had a third atmosphere and made oceans and continents full of life.

### EVOLUTION OF EARTH'S AND ATMOSPHERE

- - The atmosphere goes up to 3500 km.
    - Living forms survive a maximum within 20 km in the atmosphere, called the biosphere.
    - Parts of Biosphere - oceans, land, and atmosphere.
    - The Interior of the earth goes up to 6400 km.

**INTERIOR OF THE EARTH**

##### Evidence

**Direct Evidence**

- - Mining (3-4 km).
    - Drills - Research (9-12 km).
    - Volcanoes (400 km).
    - The limitation of direct sources about the earth's interior is that it doesn't come from deeper than 400 km.

**Indirect evidence or inferences**

- - Characteristics of the earth - temperature, density, and pressure.
    - Space material and knowledge - meteoroids, space research.
    - Seismic activities.

### Characteristics of the earth

**Temperature** 

- - When we go deeper from the surface of the earth the temperature toward the interior goes on increasing at the rate of 1-degree Celsius for every 32 meters of depth.
    - Hence, this helps us in predicting the temperature of the interior of the earth, at least to a certain depth, because we were not sure whether this rate remains constant (now we are certain that this cannot be a constant rate).
    - Because at this rate the temperature at the centre would be 2 lakh degrees Celsius but as per our advanced sources, we now know that the temperature at the centre of the earth is around 5000 degrees Celsius. 
    - The surface of the sun and upper layer of the exosphere has the same temperature i.e., 5000 degrees Celsius.

**Density**

- - Density = Total mass of earth/total volume of earth = 5.5 gm/cm cube.
    - Continental crust density - 2.7 g/cm3, Ocean Crust density - 3 g/cm3.
    - Rocks coming with volcanoes = 3.3 gm/cm cube.
    - From temperature and density, we can infer which material might be present at such depth. 
    - Average density at centre of the earth came out from inference to be 13 gm/cm cube.

**Pressure**

- - Pressure helps us predict the physical state (solid, liquid, gas) of the material inside the earth. 

**Role of seismic energy**

- - Gravity Keep changing slightly from place to place and hence we can understand what mass variation might be there in the earth's interior at those locations.
    - The magnetic field of the earth is an outcome of different magnetic materials inside the earth along with other factors such as earth's rotation etc. 
    - The earth's magnetic field also keeps varying from place to place and hence helps us in understanding what kind of magnetic material might be there inside at different places. 
    - The earthquake waves or the seismic waves are created due to seismic activities inside the earth which causes the release of seismic energy, and this energy travels in the form of seismic waves. 
    - Seismic activities in the earth's interior take place up to a depth of 700 km from mean sea level.
    - Below the earth's surface generally in the rocky region, some cracks might be there known as faculty or fault lines.
    - They might spread up to 100 or 1000s km. 
    - Some movements inside the earth might cause tension, compression, or friction, and hence energy might build up in such regions over a long period.
    - Hence, gradually substantial energy gets stored in such regions, and when the elasticity limit of the region is surpassed, then a sudden release of all the energy might take place, which is known as seismic activity. 
    - Such seismic activities release a tremendous amount of energy stored over 100 or 1000s years. 
    - This seismic activity energy released tends to shake the earth's interior by releasing shaking energy waves released from the location of seismic activities. 
    - The location of the seismic activity is known as the focus or hypocentre. 
    - Hence, the seismic energy released from the focus takes the earth's interior by traveling as seismic body waves. 
    - The body waves hit the earth's surface at different locations on the earth's surface after traveling the earth's interior as they travel inside the earth, the energy goes on decreasing, hence maximum seismic energy is transferred to the surface of the earth at the location which is vertically above the focus. 
    - This location is known as the epicentre of the seismic activity which is vertically above the hypocentre on the earth's surface.
    - When the body waves reach the earth's surface, on the earth surface they generate new waves known as surface seismic waves.
    - **These surface seismic waves vibrate the land surface, this vibration is felt by us as an earthquake.**
    - This is how the surface seismic waves create earthquakes.
    - Hence, we have 2 types of seismic waves - seismic body waves and seismic surface waves. 
    - The surface waves help us understand earthquakes.
    - The seismic body waves generated from the focus, generally travel mostly throughout the earth's interior before reaching the earth's surface at different places, where they are sensed by a device known as a seismograph. 
    - Hence by studying the seismic body waves, which reach the earth's surface at different locations, we can better understand the earth's interior region to which the seismic body waves must have travelled. 
    - This way the seismic body waves help us understand the earth's interior much better. 
    - These are the only saves that travel through the body of the earth (even gravitational waves travel through the interior of the earth and hence in very recent years our understanding of gravitational waves will also help us understand the earth and the universe better.

**Characteristics of body waves**

- - P waves are known primary and S waves are known as secondary.
    - P waves travel faster than the secondary waves and hence they reach the surface of the earth also relatively faster.
    - P waves are longitudinal whereas S waves are transverse.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 6.png>)
    - P wave can travel in all mediums i.e., solid, liquid, and gases.
    - S waves can travel only in solid medium.
        - because there is no mechanism in fluids to drive the motion perpendicular to the wave.
    - P waves bend when the density of the medium changes.

##### How P and S waves help to understand the interior of the earth.

- - The zone between 103° and 145° from the epicenter was identified as the shadow zone for both types of waves.

**S waves role** 

- - The entire zone beyond 103° does not receive S-waves, and hence this zone is identified as the shadow zone of S-waves.

**P waves role**

- - The shadow zone of P-waves is between 103° and 145° away from the epicentre.
    - This is because P-waves are refracted when they pass through the transition between the semisolid mantle and the liquid outer core.
    - However, the seismographs located beyond 145° from the epicentre, record the arrival of P-waves, but not that of S-waves.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 7.png>)

**S-Waves:**

- - As we have seen in the S-waves diagram that considering the epicentre angle of any given earthquake with respect to the centre of the earth as 0*
    - When we try to measure the places up to where the body waves appear on the earth surface, we find that they appear only up to the region which is up to 105* or 103*
    - This region on the earth surface where the S-waves does not appear is known as the S-Wave Shadow Zone 
    - From the S-Wave Shadow Zones diagram for various earthquakes, we finally conclude that there is a region at the centre of the earth where the S-Waves are not able to pass through
    - This is because it must be in a liquid state and having a spherical shape (deduced from the constant angle 105* for all the earthquakes)
    - Hence simply said the S-waves practical observation tells us the state, shape and depth known as core.

**What P-Waves tell is about Earth Interior:**

- - we observe in reality the P-Waves appears on the surface only in the region from 0* up to 105* and then it reappears on the earth's surface in the region between 145* to 180*
    - But it is not observed in the region between 105* to 145*
    - Hence from this, we deduce how P-Waves must be travelling in the earth's interior.
    - Hence they give us the final picture as per their observation 
    - In understanding the P-Wave role we already use what S-Wave has informed us about the core  
    - Hence, from the P-Wave diagram observation, we conclude that the P-Waves which do not enter the core region before they appear on the earth's surface 
    - Appear up to a maximum of 105* with respect to (wrt) the epicentre i.e. 0*
    - Whereas the P-Waves which enter the core bend twice and are not able to come out on the earth's surface between 105* to 145*
    - They come out only in the region between 145* to 180*
    - This is mainly due to the bending of the P-Wave due to change in the medium (solid to liquid and liquid to solid) as well as change in density.
    - Hence the bending tells us how much has been the change in the density
    - Hence, simply said the P-Wave observations help us understand the density difference in the core wrt to its surroundings 
    - Hence from P-Wave and S-Wave, density and state-related observations, we can figure out which minerals must be found in the core region

### Earth's Interior

**Chemical Characteristic (What Chemicals):**

- - Crust: The crust which is primarily made up of SiAl i.e. Silica and Alumina 
    - It includes both the continental crust and oceanic crust 
    - The thickness of the Ocean crust is 5 Km and that of the continental crust varies from 30 to 100 Km
    - Plains having thickness of 30 Km; plateau of about 70 Km and mountains around 100 Km
    - The rock density of oceanic crust is 3 gm/cc and that of continental crust is around 2.7 gm/cc
    - Oceanic crust is denser because it has some Magnesia along with Silica and Alumina 
    - On the other hand, Continental crust has no Magnesia but only Silica and Alumina and hence lighter than Oceanic crust
    - Mantle Region: Below the Oceanic crust comes to the mantle region and is made up of SiMa i.e. Silica and Magnesia (Oxide of Magnesium)
    - Core Region: Below the mantle region is the Core made up of NiFe i.e. Nickel and Iron
    - Hence, we can say that crust, mantle and core are chemical characteristics based classification of the earth's interior 

**Physical Characteristics of Earth's Interior (What State):**

- - The earth's interior is broadly divided into solid and liquid regions 
    - Solid Region: Further, the solid region is divided into rocky solid (Lithosphere); Weak Solid (like plastic which can bend i.e. Aesthenosphere) and nonrocky continuous hard solid (Mesosphere). All these three are part of Mantle.
    - Another fourth solid region is the Inner Core is another hard solid
    - Liquid Region- Outer Core is the liquid region
    - Lithosphere - Whole crust and top rocky mantle.
    - The oceanic lithosphere is around 10 Km thick whereas continental crust is up to 200 Km thick
    - The asthenosphere is the plastic solid which is up to the depth of 700 Km from the surface of the earth/sea level
    - The mesosphere is up to 2900 Km from the surface of the earth/sea level
    - The core is divided into outer core and inner core
    - The Outer Core (liquid) is up to a depth of 5100 Km and the inner core (solid) up to 6400 Km from the surface of the earth/sea level
    - All the depths are from the surface of the earth i.e. sea level
    - The whole core is also known as Barrysphere.
    - 7-29-51-64

**Discontinuities in the Earth's Interior**:

- - All these different regions in the earth interior are separated from each other by Zones known as dis-continuities as shown below
    - The crust has an upper and lower section and the discontinuity between them is Conard discontinuity 
    - The crust is separated from Mantle by Moho/Mohorovicic Discontinuity 
    - The Mantle is further divided into upper and lower mantle and the discontinuity between them is known as Reppitti Dis-continuity 
    - The Mantle is separated from Core by Gutenberg Discontinuity
    - The core is also divided into the lower and upper regions which are called Lehman Bullen

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 9.png>)

**Earth's Magnetism:**

- - Some metals like Iron, Nickel, etc show magnetic characters
    - Every magnet has two poles i.e. magnetic north and south poles 
    - There are some natural magnets and some are induced magnets that are created due to currents 
    - Earth's magnetism is an induced magnetism and is induced when 3 phenomena occur simultaneously perpendicular to each other 
    - These three are electric current(eddy currents), physical movement and induced magnetism
    - If any two are simultaneously present then the third is created.
    - Hence the earth creates magnetism because in the earth's interior some huge electric current is flowing along with large scale physical movement of material on which magnetism can be induced
    - The same principle applies to magnetism created on different bodies in the universe like other planets, stars, etc 
    - In the case of the earth; the earth's core has conducting metals in every hot molten liquid state which generate some kind of huge current flow inside the earth's interior 
    - The substantial speed of rotation of the earth generates the required physical movement and hence as these two conditions are fulfilled, the third phenomenon i.e. induced magnetism is created on the earth known as Geo-magnetism
    - By the same logic in the solar system, magnetism is created on many planets, some of their natural satellites as well as in the sun
    - Two planets Venus and Mars do not have magnetism because Venus rotates very slow so the required physical movement is not present.
    - Mars is very cold at its core or rather it has cooled down and does not have the required currents generated

**Importance of Earth's Magnetism:**

- - Magnetism has the characteristic of deflecting electrically charged particles
    - Earth has a magnetic field that creates a shield around itself from charged particles coming from space as solar charged particles known as solar winds which have the ability to destroy all life on earth as one of its effects
    - The solar winds are deflected by the earth's magnetic field from reaching the earth.
    - Due to the distortion of the earth's magnetic field, some solar-charged particles are able to reach near the earth's poles where they create moving lights in the sky known as Aurora
    - Also known as northern lights in the northern poles which are also known as Aurora Borealis and in southern pole it is known as Aurora Australis.
    - The earth's magnetic field is also used for navigation; for example, earlier in the seas magnets were used for navigation
    - Even some birds and animals use the earth's magnetic field for navigation. 
    - In recent years there has been news of shifting the earth's magnetic pole from the Canadian Polar region to the Russian Polar region
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 3.jpeg>)

- - It is to be noted that the earth's magnetic field reverses itself over a short period of few thousand years at an interval of few lakh years. 
    - This is known as the magnetic reversal of the earth's pole which is a natural phenomenon and has happened many times since the earth's formation 
    - Magnetic Reversals: Occasionally, over much longer periods (hundreds of thousands to millions of years), the entire magnetic field can flip, with the north and south poles reversing positions. This is called a geomagnetic reversal.
    - The reason for this magnetic reversal is not very well known
    - Though in recent years we had seen slightly faster shifting of the magnetic poles we still do not know if earth's magnetic fields are reversing finely, etc

### Movements of ocean floor and continents

- - Earlier more than a century ago our understanding of the land surface, continent, and ocean floor was that they are fixed on the earth's surface.
    - Though, in the last few centuries, starting from the 16th century, some scholars had started pointing out that the different continents seemed to be fitting together as part of a bigger block.
    - One of the first scholars to bring this out was Abraham Ortelius in 1596 and later on even Antonia Pellegrini but nobody till the beginning of the 20th century talked about any movements of the continents or the ocean floors.
    - It was in 1912, that the continental drift theory was given by Alfred Wegener, in which Wegner for the first time stated and tried to explain the movements of the continents over the ocean floors, just like ships move over the ocean.

#### _CONTINENTAL DRIFT THEORY_

**Why did Alfred Wegner say so**

- - Alfred Wegener was a palaeoclimatologist.
    - He was trying to understand the climate of the past of the earth.
    - For this, he collected vegetation and animal fossils from different continents on the earth. 
    - Because the vegetation and the animals give us clear hints about the climate of the period when these animals and plants existed. 
    - Wegener while collecting evidence from different parts of the world found some contradicting evidence as compared to the present time.
    - In the present day, polar frozen regions he found evidence of very hot equatorial tropical type of climate, whereas in the present day hot equatorial regions, he found evidence of the polar frozen type of climate in the past.
    - This was very confusing and there were just two ways to explain this or to clarify this confusion.  
    - First, in the past, both the poles were so exposed to the sun that they had hotter equatorial climates whereas the present-day equatorial climate region was less exposed to the sun that doesn't seems logical.
    - Hence simply said as per this explanation the climatic belts of the earth have not shifted, rather the continents themselves have shifted or drifted.
    - The second possibility that he thought of was that the present continents have moved or drifted from their past positions so that earlier the continents were so positioned that the tropical equatorial hot regions were in the hot climate belt on the earth and on the other hand the cold polar evidence regions on the continent were in the cold climate belts.  
    - This seemed to be more logical and he also found support in the words of scholars like Ortelius and Pellegrini.
    - Hence, he started looking for evidence and gave a complete theory in 1912.

**What does the theory say**

- - 250 million years ago all the present-day continents were joined together and were joined together known as Pangea.
    - Pangea was surrounded by a global ocean, super ocean Panthalassa.
    - Pangea started breaking into 2 groups, Laurasia and Gondwanaland where Laurasia comprised of North America and Eurasia except India.
    - Northern parts of India were not even formed by this time.
    - Gondwana land was made up of all the other continents of the present including peninsular India.
    - Laurasia had started drifting forming a sea in between known as the Tethys Sea. 
    - Around 145 million years before the present as Laurasia kept drifting northwards, Gondwanaland also started breaking as present - day South America and Africa separated from present - day Antarctica and Australia. 
    - Simultaneously peninsular India also separated from Gondwanaland and Africa and started drifting northwards. 
    - Around 65 million years ago as the northward drifting off all the broken continents continued the western continents of South America and North America also started drifting westwards. 
    - At present, we find that all these continents continue to drift Northward and westward and hence have reached their present positions.
    - Simply said Wegner in his theory said that starting from 250 million years ago all the continents were joined together a Pangea, gradually due to breaking of Pangea into different parts and simultaneous northward and westward drifting of these parts (continents), we get the present-day location of the present-day continents over the earth.

##### Evidence of Continental drift theory

**1st evidence - Jig-Saw Fit**

- - The continent shapes are taken and when we try to put them together, they are a perfect fit as part of a jig-saw puzzle. 
    - Some scholars criticized the jig-saw fit evidence of Wegner saying that the ocean surface waves might have hit continuously, the continent's coast, and hence over 250 million years, the coast shapes must have changed by waves. 
    - Hence, of the continent shapes are fitting together at present times, that doesn't mean that in the past also they were fitting. 
    - Another scholar Bullard in 1964, much after the death of Wegner made the continent-shaped map of different continents measured at the depth of 1000 fathom. (1 fathom is 1.8 meters).
    - He said that because at such depth, ocean surface waves cannot erode and break, the continental edges hence the same shapes would have been there for the continents even 250 million years before present. 
    - Hence, if these continental shapes, also fit together well then Wegner's jigsaw fit evidence was right.
    - As he was successful in making such maps and fitting them together, hence he proved that this criticism was wrong and even, in reality, the continents were together.

**2nd Evidence - Rocks on different continents**

- - He found that rocks on different continents had similar age and chemical characteristics.
    - Rocks on the eastern coast of South America had similar age and chemical characteristics as rocks on the western coast of Africa. 
    - The question was how so far away, rocks had similar age and chemical characteristics. 
    - Wegner answered this question by saying if we place the continents the way he is suggesting in his theory, for Pangea.
    - Then because the continents were joined together, hence the rocks must have formed together much before Pangea started breaking (the rocks on these coasts are as old as 2000 million years). 
    - Then as the continents broke and moved away the rocks on the coast were separated and coastal deposits were deposited on these newly formed coasts. 
    - Therefore, the coastal rocks are thousand of million years old and similar but the coastal deposits are less than 250 million years old and hence new.

**3rd evidence - Placer deposits**

- - A placer deposit or placer is an accumulation of valuable minerals formed by gravity separation from a specific source rock during sedimentary processes.
    - The mineral rocks might be far away from the mineral deposits because the deposits are brought by different mediums like waves, rivers, etc. Such deposits are called placer deposits.
    - Wegner found placer deposits of gold on the Ghana coast of Africa but there were no gold mines nearby.
    - Whereas goldmines are found on the Brazilian coast and Wegner said that when the continents were joined together as told in his theory then the gold must have moved as placer deposit from the Brazilian gold mines to the African coast.
    - Then the continents broker away and the placer deposits separated from the mines. 

**4th evidence - Fossil evidence**

- - Fossils of Cynognathus, Glossopteris, Lystrosaurus, and Mesosaurus were found by Wegner on present-day continents. 
    - But, Wegner said if you put the continents together as per his theory in Pangea then we can see definite belts of migration of these animals and plants over Pangea before it started breaking. 
    - Hence, he said that the continents must have been together.

**5th Evidence - Tillites**

- - The Tillites or till deposits are deposits of broken rock parts that move at the bottom of glaciers hence they keep moving till the glaciers are moving as some of these deposits go on getting deposited at different places. 
    - Then gradually, if the climate of the region changes and the glaciers completely melt away with no sign of water left behind, the till deposits become the evidence of glaciers in those regions. 
    - This is how even millions of years later after the glaciers have disappeared, from the till deposits we come to know that in these regions glaciers were present earlier. 
    - Wegner found till deposits evidence in different parts of the world in tropical equatorial regions also.
    - Many of these regions are tropical regions now and hence it is not possible to have glaciers in these regions but not in their neighbouring regions.
    - Wegner explains that glaciers in these regions were only possible if we place these regions as Pangea around the south pole and all these regions at that time were inside the southern polar circle.
    - Hence, these regions had glaciers as part of Pangea. 
    - Gradually they broke and reached the present location. 

**Weaknesses of continental drift theory** 

- - Wegner talked about the movements of the continents in a northward and westward direction, whereas practical observations have shown that the continents, or rather the crust drift in all directions.
    - Wegener started nearly 250 million years before the present whereas in reality it has been observed that the continents have been moving or drifting nearly since their formation which was around 4000 million years before the present.  
    - Wegner started from the last supercontinent and then talked about the breaking of the supercontinent and the formation of the different continents of present times. 
    - But, in reality, in the past, this process has taken place many times and different supercontinents have formed and then broken with drifting of the continents of those times and then later on those continents again coming together to form newer supercontinents.
    - In this sequence, Pangea was the last supercontinent, which had broken, and millions of years in the future all the present continents would join together to form a new supercontinent.
    - Wegner did not talk about the movements of the ocean floor and rather he said that the continents drift over the fixed ocean floors in the same way as the ship drifts over the ocean water surface.
    - But, in reality, it is found that both continentals, as well as oceanic crusts, are drifting, and also it has been found that continental crust is not drifting over the oceanic crust.
    - The reasons that he gave for the northward and westward movement of the continent were wrong.

**Wegner's contribution**

- - Wegner was the first scholar about 100 years ago to talk about and give a complete theory about drifting off the continents. 
    - His weaknesses led to further research in understanding how the different crusts of the earth are behaving and this way his work proved to be the foundation in many ways to much later research.

**Reasons are given for movements**

- - Northwards movement - Polar fleeing force (centrifugal effect). ( trying to maximise their distance from centre) 
    - Westward movement - Tidal forces. He said as tides move east to west in oceans, tides drifts continents westwards just like waves can push ships in some directions.

### POST DRIFT THEORIES/ DEVELOPMENTS

**Convection** --- the movement caused within a fluid by the tendency of hotter and therefore less dense material to rise, and colder, denser material to sink under the influence of gravity, which consequently results in transfer of heat.

**Convectional current theory**

- - Given by Arthur Holmes.
    - Convections are created in fluid mediums which can flow when the fluid is heated and because of heating and related expansion, it becomes lighter than the surroundings and hence tends to rise to create vertical rising movements known as convections.
    - When such convections gradually cool down they again tend to sink at some other locations completing the cycle of convection by sinking conventions.
    - As per Arthur Holmes presence of radioactive material in mantle material is the cause for the creation of the convectional cycle in the molten mantle region.
    - These convectional cycles comprise molten material. Hence conventional theory discarded the reasons given by Alfred Wagner for the movement of the continents.

**Mapping of the ocean floor**

- - During WWII many ships sank and sonars were sent, to find such sunken objects.
    - During such sonar-based expeditions, it was realized that the ocean floor had many uneven surfaces and hence they were not as flat and featureless as we thought them to be.
    - Rather there are many formations on the ocean floor.
    - Once we realize so many features were present on the ocean floor, further studies were done and more characteristics of the ocean floor were realized.

**Different features of the ocean floor**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 10.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 11.png>)

- - The first region is the continental margin which is made up of continental shelf(< 1 degree slope), continental slope, continental rise, and also it contains partly the side of the continental margin trench which is towards the continental rise.
    - Continental margin = c shelf + c slope + c rise + deep oceanic trenches
    - Continental shelves are generally around 80 km wide measured from the coast of the continent. (At some coast they can be as wide as 1500 kms)
    - Continental slopes are generally formed 200-300 meters up to around 3000-6000 meters.
    - Oceanic trenches are on an average 3-5 km deep from the ocean floor. These are suddenly deep regions like a long deep cut on the floor of the ocean floor.
    - We have found nearly 57 trenches in all global oceans. The deepest of them is Mariana Trench in which the deepest point is known as challenger deep.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 12.png>)
    - There are two type of continental trenches - continental trenches and deep oceanic trenches.
    - At places where there are no continental margin trenches the abyssal planes directly start after the continental rise.
    - Ridges are also known as seamounts which are on an average 3000-4500 meters tall and mountains with pointed peaks. They rise from the ocean floor but never reach the ocean surface or mean sea level.
    - Islands are like Guyots(flat top) or ridges but they have risen above the mean sea level and hence are small land regions surrounded by oceans.
    - Mid-oceanic ridges are like two parallel mountain chains or ranges divided or separated by large depressions known as the central fault of the mid-oceanic ridges. These central fault regions are generally seen to have continuous low volcanic eruptions.
    - When we see in the world oceans the average height of the mid-oceanic ridges is around 2000-2500 meters and hence they rarely rise above sea level.
    - It has also been observed by studying the ocean floor is that generally around the central fault of mid-oceanic ridges we have volcanic eruptions.
    - The age of the rocks in general on the ocean floor keeps getting older as one moves away from the mid-ocean ridges towards the trenches.
    - The age of the rocks never gets older than 200 million years for the rocks of the ocean floor whereas continental rocks have been found to be as old as more than 3500 million years.
    - The equidistant rocks from the central fault or the crest of the mid-oceanic ridges on both sides of the central floor equidistant rock at a similar age, structure, and chemical composition.
    - Also, it was found that though we expected that the ocean floors would have very old and thick sediments coming from the continents and deposited on the ocean floors.
    - But, in reality, it was found that the sediments are very thin and also never older than 200 million years. This was despite the fact that oceans are as old as 4000 million years.
    - Earthquakes were seen to happen frequently near mid-oceanic ridges where the hypocentres was never very deep and also near the trenches where the hypocentres were generally very deep.
    - All these observations led to a new theory given in 1961 by Harry Hess known as Seafloor spreading theory.

### Seafloor spreading theory

- - At the mid-oceanic ridges, central fault some magma rises to cause a volcanic eruption.
    - This magma is part of a much larger convectional cycle taking place below the oceanic lithosphere.
    - Most of this convection does not erupt and rather it diverges below the oceanic lithosphere.
    - This divergence causes the seafloor to continuously drift away from the central fault region causing the seafloor to spread at the same time as newer magma is also rising and erupting along with the deep depression of the central fault as this volcanic lava gradually cools down it keeps adding new rocky material along the deep depression wall.
    - Hence forming new material for the mid-oceanic ridges while the older material keeps going away from the central fault.
    - Also, as it keeps eroding, the height to mid-oceanic ridges goes on decreasing finally becoming the abyssal plain.
    - This is how newer rocks are formed at mid-oceanic ridges as older rocks keep going away and finally the oldest rocks go down into deep trenches.

- - Seafloor spreading theory as explained by Harry Hess was the first theory to discuss the formation and spreading of the ocean floor in a symmetrical manner over a period of time on either side of the central fault of the MOR, starting from the MOR.
    - This formation and spreading of the seafloor at the MOR are mainly driven by the rising convections in the asthenosphere which cause continuous volcanic eruptions through the central fault hence providing the molten lava needed to solidify and turn into new MOR (the seafloor).
    - The diverging conversion below the oceanic lithosphere also moves the lithosphere away on the two sides of the MOR and hence the spreading.
    - This finally ends in the trenches.
    - This way all the observations of the ocean floor are broadly justified by the seafloor spreading theory.
    - Hence, we can see that the volcanic eruptions at the MOR, newer rocks near the MOR, similar character of rocks at a similar distance on the two sides of the MOR.
    - Older rocks as we go away from the MOR and the oldest rocks at the trenches all these observations are justified now as per seafloor spreading theory.
    - Also, the shallow focus earthquakes along the MOR are also justified by the rising part of the asthenosphere.
    - As well deep-focus earthquakes along the trenches are also justified which are due to the sinking of the oceanic floor back into the asthenosphere.
    - We can also understand that from formation to the destruction of seafloor the total time taken is never more than 200 million years and hence we never get any rocks or sediments older than 200 million years from the ocean floors.
    - Harry Hess also used the regular reversal of the earth's magnetic field as evidence to support the sea-floor spreading theory.
    - Earth's magnetic field reversal is a well-known fact known to take place after every few lakh years.
    - Harry Hess used this phenomenon by stating that on the ocean floor we should find alternate bands of magnetic material which came out with the lava eruptions where these alternating bands could show the reversing of earth's magnetism.
    - The newest band on top of the MOR should show the present time magnetic field direction of the earth. (alternate band of magnetic material on the sea-floor)
    - This was also practically confirmed from the samples from the seafloor.

**Challenges/Weaknesses of sea-floor spreading theory**

- - This theory does not talk much about continent formation and movements. 
    - Do not talk about smaller formations such as ridges, seamounts, Guyot. 

**Contribution** 

- - First theory talking about the formation and talking spreading of the seafloor which was also practically confirmed.

**Conclusion**

- - Still, there was no comprehensive understanding of the continental oceanic and lithospheric formation and movements and many other formations on the continents and the ocean floors.
    - Further newer observations led to the evolution of a newer more comprehensive theory known as the plate tectonic theory in 1967.

### PLATE TECTONIC THEORY

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 13.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 4.jpeg>)

- - It was developed by a team of many scientists, Mackenzie, Parker, Morgan, Wilson - **more comprehensive theory**
    - As mentioned in the diagram the whole of the earth's lithosphere is broken into pieces known as plates tectonic plates.
    - The bigger plates are known as major plates.
    - Bigger plates are 7 in number and the smaller pieces are known as minor plates.
    - There are many minor plates. 
    - —- oceanic plate ( pacific ) and continental plates (all other 6 major plate)  

**Classification of plates based on lithosphere on the given margin (common margin where two plates are meeting) of plates**

- - The most common and most used classification.
    - The edges of the plates are called margins.
    - When plates share the boundaries it is called common margin.
    - There are two type of margins —- diverging margin and converging margin 

**Reasons for the tectonic plate movement**

- - The molten magma rises from the depth and spreads laterally below the crust.
    - While spreading, it moves the overlying plate along with it. The molten magma then sinks back, completing a cyclical motion.
    - The molten magma beneath the lithospheric plates is kept molten from the heat released from the radioactive decay in this region from the residual heat coming from higher depths.
    - Ridge Push is the pushing movement along the mid-oceanic ridge where the magma is able to penetrate the lithosphere and hence, pushes the fractured plate laterally.
    - Slab Pull occurs along the trenches or subduction zones where the underlying plate moves down due to gravity and progressively pulls down the plate.

**3 types of interacting margins**

- - Oceanic-oceanic (O-O).
    - Oceanic-continent (O-C).
    - Continent-continent (C-C).
    - There are two types of convictions causing different plate boundaries, Rising convection, and Sinking convection.
    - Rising convection causes divergence at the margin.
    - Sinking convection causes convergence at the margin.
    - Side by side convection (in the relatively opposite direction) causes transform movement at margins.
    - Under Rising convection and related diverging plates margins we can get all 3 types of plate margins - Oceanic-oceanic, oceanic-continental and continental-continental.
    - Sinking convection and related converging plate margins also all three types of plate margins can be found.
    - The same applies to transform boundaries too.
    - So, in all, we have 9 types of boundaries.

#### _Layers of earth_

- - The lithosphere is the earth’s solid outer crust.
    - It is rich in Silica, hence acidic in nature.
    - It is separated into Continental and Oceanic plates.
    - The Asthenosphere is the part of the Upper Mantle which lies just beneath the lithosphere, rich in Iron, Magnesium, hence basic in nature.
    - Continental and Oceanic plates are situated on the Asthenosphere.
    - Temperature is very high at the Asthenosphere, which makes it partially molten, and fluid enough to flow very slowly under heat convection currents.

**Boundaries**

- - Divergent Boundary - Plates move away from each other to form Mid Oceanic Ridges on the floor and Rift Valleys on the land, among other landforms. Formation of the new lithosphere.
    - Convergent Boundary- Plates collide with each other to form Fold Mountains on land and Trenches on the seafloor. Destruction of the old lithosphere.
    - Transform Boundary - Plates slide past each other. It causes no construction or destruction, only deformation of the existing landform.

**Rift valley**

- - Rift valleys are created when due to faulting and block formation and resultant vertical adjustment of the blocks (1000s of km long) long depressions are created which might be deep by a few kilometres and wide by 30-40 or 100 km.
    - Standing at the lower parts of the rift the vertical high rising sides look like mountains which are the block mountains. 
    - For example, the Rift of Vindhya and Satpura, Vosges, and the black forest at the boundary of France and Germany. 
    - In the rift of which the rhine river flows.
    - If the long rifts are so sloping that water from both sides block mountains flows through the rift it can lead to river formation in the rift or aid the already flowing river.
    - For example, rhine is not formed by rifting but aided by rifting.
    - But, if the rift is not so sloping then the water from the nearby slopes might accumulate at different depressions in the rift leading to the formation of different lakes in the rift.

**Magma**

- - When Blocks between two continental plates are adjusting themselves.
    - They can melt and form magma.
    - There are two types of Magma. ( 1. Rising convection magma (lithosphere melted magma), 2. magma formed due to sinking (asthenosphere rising magma) )
    - Magma from the Asthenosphere- rising from deep inside and Block melted magma- formed by a slight sinking of melting lithosphere.
    - Since the density of the lithosphere is lighter than the density of the asthenosphere, hence Lithospheric magma is less dense than Asthenosphere Magma.
    - The ability of flow (or even viscosity) is not related to density.
    - Asthenosphere magma has more ability to flow.
    - Lithosphere melted magma- more vertical.
    - Asthenosphere rising melted magma- more horizontal.
    - Asthenosphere magma is hotter and mostly in a molten state, so it does not solidify as fast as the lithosphere.
    - New Asthenosphere magma can easily displace the earlier ones.
    - Hence no explosive eruption. Most eruptions of Asthenosphere magma are silent.
    - Lithospheric magma show explosive eruptions because it solidifies fast, hence new magma must displace earlier solidified magma, which will need much force.
    - Lithosphere has more silica.
    - So lithospheric magma will be lighter and more acidic.
    - Lithospheric magma is also called Andesitic magma.
    - The asthenosphere has more iron and magnesium.
    - Asthenosphere magma is darker in colour.
    - Asthenosphere magma- is basic in nature, and called- Basaltic magma.
    - Due to the lighter magma eruption in the rift can lead to volcanically active peaks.
    - For example - Mount Kilimanjaro(Tanzania), Mount logan(Canada), Mount Elgon(Uganda), Mount Longonot(Kenya), Mount Meru(Tanzania).

**Volcanism in Rift Valleys**

- - The East African Rift Zone is the largest seismically active rift system on earth. It includes many active and dormant volcanoes.
    - During the formation of the African rift valley, a lot of faulting occurred. The stress in crustal blocks melted the subsurface lithosphere into magma.
    - This lithospheric magma had a high silica proportion.
    - Due to this faulting, Kilimanjaro lies outside of Rift Valley, though being formed by it.
    - Also, the resultant acidic lithospheric magma caused Kilimanjaro to be a Stratovolcano.
    - Normally divergent boundaries see basaltic magma which makes Shield volcano.

**Oceanic – Oceanic convergence**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 14.png>)

- - In the case of convergence of oceanic plates(at least one of the oceanic plates) always tends to sink into the asthenosphere.
    - On the other hand, during the convergence of continental plates never sink, rather they tend to rise.
    - Due to the sinking of denser oceanic plates, convection will get affected.
    - The first formation is of the oceanic trench.
    - Second Formation - Lithosphere melting magma.
    - This will start cracking the non-sinking plate. The magma will erupt in the process and hence create relatively vertical peaks.
    - This will cause volcanic activity on the ocean floor to create volcanic peaks. This will form Ridges/ Seamounts and Guyots.
    - Ocean-Ocean Convergence on the ocean floor gives Lithospheric melting magma.
    - Ocean-Ocean Divergence on the ocean floor gives the Asthenosphere rising magma.
        - Examples, red sea, and the Gulf of Aden.
    - When the continents further diverge away and simultaneously due to basaltic eruption along with the MOR newer ocean floor is formed, the seafloor spreads further forming bigger oceans.
    - For example, the Indian ocean and the Atlantic ocean.

- - As the denser oceanic plate subducts below the relatively less dense oceanic plate, it leads to the formation of trenches. Thus subducting oceanic plate tends to melt and its lighter silica-rich material tends to rise. Whereas the remaining basaltic dense material tends to sink.
    - The rising lighter magma creates acidic volcanism above the seafloor and leads to relatively vertical formations such as ridges, seamounts, guyots, till they are below sea level. When they rise above sea level, they lead to the formation of islands.
    - These islands are generally volcanically active. Hence they have volcanic peaks.
    - This way nearly parallel to the trenches a whole chain or arc of islands are formed known as island arcs/island chains/Archipelagoes e.g. the Aleutian Islands, Kurile Islands, Japan Islands, and the Philippines, Indonesian Islands also the Andaman Nicobar Islands.

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 5.jpeg>)
    - In a similar way, even the New Zealand and the Caribbean Islands are formed.

**Oceanic-Continental Convergence**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 15.png>)

- - When oceanic-continental convergence starts, then the oceanic plate tends to subduct below the continental plate, forming a trench at the margin of convergence.
    - Simultaneously, the lighter continental plate tends to fold creating a fold mountain chain on the continental crust, parallel to the convergence margin. Hence, such mountains will be near to the coast like the Andes and the Rockies.
    - Due to the subducting oceanic plate, some volcanic activity is also created due to the rising magma below the continental plate. This leads to the formation of some volcanic peaks in the fold mountains.
    - Andes fold mountain is formed due to South American continental plate and Pacific oceanic plate convergence. And there are many volcanically active peaks in the Andes mountain e.g. Cotopaxi(equador, highest active volcano), Aconcagua, Ampato, Misti, Chimborazo, Tolima, Sangay etc.
    - When we look at North America along the Western coast, we find the Rockies mountain, they are also found due to the oceanic, continental convergence. And there are some volcanically active peaks in the Rockies also e.g.. Mt. Saint Helens, Dotsero, etc.
    - In oceanic-continental convergence, the oceanic plate tends to subduct whereas the continental plate tends to fold forming fold mountains. The subducting oceanic plate leads to some volcanic activity in the fold mountains.

**Continental-Continental Convergence**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 16.png>)

- - When we have C-C convergence, neither of the plates subduct. 
    - In very special cases like the Tibetan Plateau region, there might be some doubling/overlapping of the plate and hence forming a tectonic plateau like the Tibetan plateau.
    - But in general, it would only lead to both the plates folding and hence forming fold mountains where they have converged.
    - Hence, starting from divergence where we have C-C divergence where one continent gradually breaks into two continents and over a period forms ocean in between at some place of the earth. But because the earth is spherical hence at some other place the ocean between continents is gradually consumed and the continents converge along the fold mountains to form a bigger continent and this way the breaking and joining of continents and forming and consuming of oceans goes on in a cyclic manner many times. In this process, different formations are made on the oceanic and continental floors as discussed earlier.

**Transform Movement**

- - Divergent plate boundaries are called **Constructive plate boundaries**, and converging plate margins are referred to as **Destructive plate margins**.
    - A transform boundary is neither a constructive nor a destructive boundary. Also called a **Conservative Boundary**.
    - Three types -
    - The **continental-continental transform boundary** just looks like a fault. E.g. San Andreas fault in the USA.
    - Similarly, **Oceanic-oceanic transform faults (boundary)** form only along the MORs where the whole part of the MOR gets fractured into pieces.
    - **Oceanic-continental transform movement** does not take place.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 17.png>)

- - Faulting
        - Normal Fault - Divergent plate boundary
        - Reverse Fault - Convergent plate boundary
        - Strike slip Fault - Transform plate boundary
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 6.jpeg>)

### Intra plate tectonic activities

- - They take place within the plate.
    - **How do they take place?**
        - Magma is involved in interplate tectonic activity.
    - Types of magma
    - 2 types were already covered in the previous class.

- - **Asthenosphere - normal convection magma**
        - This is basic and basaltic.
        - More higher than 7 pH
        - Formation: Relatively more horizontal
        - Leads to the formation of the Abyssal Plain
        - Mid Oceanic Ridge
    - **Lithospheric melted magma -**
        - Formed by melting of lithosphere in convergence boundary (O-O & O-C)
        - It is acidic and andesitic.
        - Less than 7 pH.
        - It leads to formation of strato volcanoes, ridges and seamounts.
    - **Mantle Plume Magma - Less basic.**
        - Slightly more than 7 pH.
        - Relatively less horizontal.
        - They are shield volcano domes.
        - It leads to formation of Fissure Basalt Plateau. They form only on land and not on the ocean floor.
        - Mantle plumes are also known as hot spots.

#### _Hotspots_

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 7.jpeg>)

- - Globally, we have different hotspots of importance such as Galapagos, Hawaiian, Azores, Icelandic hotspot.
    - Icelandic is at the plate margin.
    - Hawaiian island - The plate kept moving due to convection.
    - This led to the formation of the Emperor seamount chain, Midway, Hawaiian Ridge, and Hawaii in a sequence.

**Mantle plume activity over the seafloor**

- - The mantle plume might erupt in the inner parts of the plate away from the margin either over the ocean floor or over the continental crust.
    - Over the ocean floors, the mantle plume leads to the formation of shield volcanoes only and hence forms either seamounts, ridges, or guyots if the formation remains below the sea level, or might form islands also if the formation rises above the sea level.
    - E.g.- the Emperor seamount chain, the Hawaiian ridges, and the different islands such as Hawaiian island, Galapagos, Azores, Reunion, Yellowstone (continental).

- - **What are Mantle plumes?**
    - They are also known as hotspots are formed in the asthenosphere region due to some variation in the density and mineral composition of the material in the asthenosphere.
    - Hence, this material in the asthenosphere does not mix with the rest of the asthenosphere magma and rather it rises as huge bubbles of magma which could fracture the plates and cause volcanic eruption and relatively basaltic eruption known as mantle plume. This might take place either on the ocean floor or over the continental crust.
    - Basalt is a mafic(mg-fe) extrusive igneous rock formed from the rapid cooling of lava rich in magnesium and iron exposed at or very near the surface of a terrestrial planet or a moon. More than 90% of all volcanic rock on Earth is basalt, and the eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year.
    - **Difference between mantle plume island and converging plate islands**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Mantle Plume Island|Converging Plate Island|
|- - - Mantle plumes are in general away from plate margins or trenches.<br>        - Though there are some exceptions also like Iceland (where 2 plates meet)|- - - In the case of the converging plate islands, the islands would always be parallel to as well as near the trenches.|
|- - - Mantle plume islands are newer just above the mantle plume/ hotspots activity regions. They are also volcanically active.|- - - But when we go away from the hotspot activity region. The islands would be older and volcanically inactive having formed and moved away from the hotspot region due to the normal asthenosphere convection, gradually moving the plates.|

**Hotspot activity over the continent crust**

- - When the hotspot activity takes place over the continental crust, it generally leads to the formation of basalt lava plateaus and rarely leads to the formation of shield volcanoes depending upon the particular erupting magma.
    - An example of mantle plume eruption over continental crust is the Deccan Basalt Lava plateau.

- - Around 65 million years before the present, when the Indian subcontinent crust region was moving from south to north, it was located over the reunion hotspot which was active then also.
    - The mantle plume lava eruption over the Indian subcontinent region led to the formation of the Deccan Basalt lava plateau region as the Indian subcontinent moved further north and hence away from the reunion hotspot.
    - The mantle plume eruption stopped over the subcontinent and continued over the oceanic floor region.
    - Gradually, the Indian subcontinent united with the Eurasian subcontinent and at the hotspot region an island was formed known as reunion island.
    - Similar lava plateaus are also formed in other parts of the world such as the Columbia snake Lava plateau in North America. the Patagonia plateau in south America, the Siberian plateau in Russia and also the Mongolian plateau in Mongolia and the Ethiopian plateau from where the Nile river starts in Africa.

### Volcanoes

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 18.png>)

- - The term is derived from the word Volcano which means “flow of lava”.
    - It is below the Earth’s surface in the lithosphere crust is also volcanism which is called as Intrusive volcano. 
    - Once it erupts over the land surface, it is the flow of lava over the land surface. It is called as extrusive.

- - In the region, below the earth surface normally there are layers of sediments forming the crust or lithosphere region.
    - In this region, as the lava flows through, it can move broadly **either near horizontally** between the layers or it can move relatively vertically across the layers.

- - **Horizontal formation:**
        - The simplest one is sills.
        - Others are Laccolith - the large dome-shaped mound which has a level base fed by a pipe
        - Phacolith - lens-shaped 
        - Lopolith - saucer shape
        - Batholith - huge mass of igneous rocks
    - **Vertical formation**
        - Dyke

**Extrusive volcanoes**

- - It is grouped on the basis of the frequency of volcanic activity
    - They are divided into 3 parts
    - Active which have erupted frequently in the recent past.
    - Dormant volcanoes are known to have erupted or shown signs of possible eruption in the future.
    - Extinct volcanoes are volcanic formations, but have not erupted in human history.
    - But this is not a very technical classification rather based on observation.
    - Also, any active volcano can become dormant or extinct volcano can suddenly erupt and become eruptive or can show the signs of eruption but become dormant.
    - The other classification is relatively more scientific as shown below:

**Nature of magma and shape of formation**

- - **Asthenosphere convection and magma volcanoes:**
        - Over ocean floor: Mid oceanic ridges
        - Over the continents : It does not take place over the continent. 
    - **The mantle plume magma volcanoes**
        - They can take place over the both ocean and continents.
        - Over the ocean, it will form a shield volcano that is dome-shaped.
        - Over the continent, mostly, it is a basalt lava plateau.
        - And rarely, it will form, shield volcano domes such as the Mauna Loa and Kilauea dome peaks on the Hawaiian island.

- - **3 type of volcanos -  less acidic, moderate acidic and most acidic**
        - Less acidic — Ash and cinder volcano 
            - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 8.jpeg>)

- - Moderate acidic — Strato volcano - all the major volcanic peaks in the world
    - Most acidic —- caldera cone volcanos (upper part fully blown away during eruption, normally hollow region turns into lake called as crater or caldera)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 9.jpeg>)

**Distribution of volcanoes**

- - Volcanoes are generally found more along the plate margins such as converging and diverging plate boundaries and relatively lesser in the interiors of plates where they are found around the mantle plume region.
    - When we see the global distribution of volcanoes, we find that the margins of the pacific plate contains 2/3rd of the world's volcanoes.
    - It is also known as the pacific ring of fire with more than 250 active volcanoes in the region.
    - The other region known for volcanic activity includes the extension of the circum-pacific belt up to the Andaman Nicobar islands.
    - Active volcanoes are also found in the East African rift valley, Mediterranean sea region as also in the Caribbean islands and some active volcanoes along the mid-Atlantic region.
    - At some places, we also find hot water bodies which are related to underground volcanic regions of the present or past.
    - These regions are known as natural hot water body regions, geysers or hot springs.

### Earthquakes

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 19.png>)

- - Surface waves are created when body waves hit the surface of the earth. 
    - These waves are created like waves on a water surface created due to a stone dropping in water.
    - Surface waves travel only on the surface of the earth. 
    - There are two types of surface waves, the Rayleigh waves and L waves (Love waves).
    - These surface waves are transverse waves where Rayleigh travels like water waves.
    - Whereas love waves travel snake-like, they are the reason for most of the destruction that we see during the earthquake.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 10.jpeg>)

- - Earthquakes are also classified on the basis of the depth of their focus from the epicentre.
    - The focus shallower than 70 km is known as shallow-focus earthquake, which has its effect only up to a narrow region.
    - The second type of earthquake is between 70-300 km, known as inter-mediate earthquakes, they have their effect over a relatively inter-mediate region.
    - Earthquakes with a focus deeper than 300 km are known as deep-focus earthquakes, they affect a relatively much wider region.
    - Earthquakes are created due to seismic activities causing a sudden release of a considerable amount of energy in the earth's interior where the interior rocks surpass their elastic limit releasing considerable seismic energy creating seismic waves causing earthquakes.

**Causes of earthquakes**

- - Earthquakes can because naturally due to tectonic activities such as plate movement, mantle plume activities, volcanic activities, meteorites falling on earth can create huge earthquakes, landslides.
    - Human-induced earthquakes - due to mining activities when hollow regions collapse, groundwater extraction, construction and blasts and related activities, reservoir induced seismicity, nuclear explosion.

**Measurement of seismic activity**

- - We have two types of scales to measure seismic activities.
    - **Intensity-based scale and measured amplitude** were used for calculated magnitude.
    - Intensity-based scale is how strong the earthquake is as we feel it, it is subjective hence not very scientific.
    - **Amplitude based is based on measured shaking of the earth called amplitude, with a machine called a seismograph**.
    - We have magnitude-based scales - Richter and moment-based.
    - We have two intensity-based scales- the Mercalli scale (derived by Mercalli) and Medvedev.
    - The Mercalli scale was the first scale used for measuring earthquakes in 1902 and the scale is divided into twelve scale levels, ranging from level one which is an earthquake not even felt by human beings.
    - The strong earthquakes as per this are from level-6 and extreme earthquakes are from level-12 where level 12 implies total destruction and ground seems to move like a wave and things are up in the air.
    - But, the Mercalli scale has a limitation because it is based on the perception of the people.

**MSK Scale**

- - It is a macro - seismic scale used for giving national-level data of earthquakes dividing the regions into different earthquake-prone zones.
    - For example, the government of India has divided the whole country into four earthquake-prone zones starting from zone- II up to zone- V.
    - Earlier we had a zone-I which was later on merged with zone-II.
    - These 4 zones of India are on the basis of level - 5-6 up to level 9 of the MSK scale.
    - Zone 5 is the most destructive earthquake-prone zone in India.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 11.jpeg>)

**Richter scale**

- - The Richter scale is a more scientific scale.
    - The magnitude is from 1-10.
    - Magnitude is a measure of strength or amount of energy released during an earthquake.
    - Each number increase in magnitude on the scale implies 10 times increase in the amplitude of the earthquake, which also means a nearly 31-32 times energy release increase as the magnitude scales are logarithmic scales.

**Moments Scale**

- - The Richter scale has a limitation in that it is not very accurate in measuring earthquakes of magnitude more than 8 and hence a moment scale is developed for measuring earthquakes of more than 8.
    - The moment scale is based on the total moment released of an earthquake, where the moment is the product of the distance that fault moves due to the earthquake and the energy required to move that distance.

**Earthquake-prone regions in the world**

- - On average, more than 50000 earthquakes happen annually.
    - Nearly, 70% of all earthquakes occur in the circumpacific region.
    - Nearly 20% of earthquakes occur in the Mediterranean Himalayan region from the alps up to the Himalayas and also the mountains in China, north of Tibet.
    - The rest of all the regions on the earth get only the remaining 10% of the earthquake.
    - The most intense earthquake ever measured in the world was in the 1960s in Chile at a place called Valdivia with a magnitude of 9.5.
    - One of the most intense regions in India was in 1934 near the Nepal-Bihar border with 8.4 points.

### Tsunami

- - The word Tsunami has a Japanese origin, meaning harbour waves.
    - But, in reality, the word tsunami is a misnomer because tsunami waves are not harbouring waves and are not created at the harbours but rather are created in deep oceans and open ocean regions.

**Causes tsunami**

- - Tsunami waves can be created on the deep ocean floors due to tectonic activities, can be caused by explosive Volcanoes on the ocean floors, also can be caused by deep water landslides and also by meteorite hits or by a nuclear explosion in the oceans also.
    - For a tsunami wave to be formed an earthquake of magnitude around 6.5 or is required as lower magnitude earthquakes do not cause a tsunami in general.

**How the Tsunami is formed**

- - For tsunamis to form we need a decent magnitude earthquake (magnitude equal to more than 6.5).
    - Such a seismic activity leads to a tremendous amount of sudden release of energy and this released energy travels in the deep ocean as waves gradually move up to the surface of the ocean in the open ocean region.
    - The Tsunami waves on the surface of the ocean in open oceans are very wide one wave from a very little height but very high speed which means very high kinetic energy
    - This is due to the low fiction provided by water.
    - As the waves travel closer to the ocean coast, the ocean depth decreases and the waves start getting friction from shallower water.
    - Hence, the waves speed starts to decrease and the high kinetic energy gradually starts to change into higher potential energy which means the higher height of the waves with lesser speed.
    - Hence, the tsunami wave takes more height near the shallower coast and despite the lower speed, as compared to speed in the open ocean, away from the coast. 
    - Still, the speed on the coast is high enough to flood the whole coast and cause enough damage to humans before they could evacuate the coast.
    - The tsunami wave height near the coast are up to 30 meters high and the wave speeds are up to 50 km per hour.
    - This is why tsunami is so destructive. 
    - When a tsunami is created more than one tsunami wave is created.
    - Every tsunami wave has a low part and a high part.
    - During high tsunami waves, flooding of the coasts generally takes place due to fast-moving waves.
    - Whereas the low waves generally lead to the ocean water receding and hence exposing the coastal continental shelf.
    - People who do not understand this phenomenon might move towards the exposed continental shelf during the low tsunami wave without realising that a following high tsunami wave will succeed the low tsunami wave.
    - Hence, again it will flood the coast, causing damage and loss of life.
    - Hence, during a tsunami, one should not move toward the continental shelf even if the water is receding backwards.

**Tsunami Genesis**

- - Tsunami genesis is the process of formation of tsunamis and normally plate margins in the deep open ocean regions are considered as tsunamigenic regions.
    - Such as the Indonesian tsunamigenic region, tsunamis form can affect India's eastern coast as well as Makran, a tsunamigenic region near Pakistan- Iran border can affect India’s western coast.

## GEOMORPHIC FORCES AND PROCESSES

- - Geomorph means changing the earth surface.
    - Endogenic forces - un-levelling the earth surface.
    - Exogenic forces - levelling the earth surface.
    - Endogenic and exogenic forces together are called geomorphic processes/forces, because they change the earth's surface continuously.

**Types of forces**

- - Sudden catastrophic forces and slow Diastrophic forces.
    - Sudden - earthquakes and volcanoes.
    - Diastrophic - Vertical and horizontal.
        - Vertical forces (Epeirogenic forces)- Uplifting or subsiding . - mainland uplifting - continental building
        - Horizontal forces (orogenic forces) - compressing and tensing. - mountain building through severe folding
        - Earthquakes - involving local minor movements
        - Plate tectonics - horizontal movements of crustal plates.

**Endogenic processes**

- - Diastrophism
    - Volcanism

**Exogenic forces**

- - Energy - solar energy.

- - The process of levelling the region is called gradation.
    - Gradation is achieved by degradation and aggradation.
    - Degradation of uplifted regions.
    - Aggradation of depressed regions.

**How is gradation achieved**

- - Geomorphic processes are of two types exogenic and endogenic.
    - The exogenic geomorphic process is gradation which involves degradation and aggradation which is achieved by denudation.
    - The process of gradation involves 5 sub-processes.
        - Weathering - breaking at the location. (in-situ).
        - Mass movement - Moving broken material down the slope using gravity.
        - Erosion - Breaking of material due to friction is called erosion.
        - Transportation - by agents - (rivers, glaciers winds, waves, ground water)
        - Deposition

Degradation and aggradation is achieved by denudation

### Sub-processes of denudation

##### Weathering

- - Weathering basically means breaking at the site. 
    - Three types of weathering take place in nature.
        - Physical weathering - due to physical processes.
        - Chemical weathering - involves chemical reactions and chemical processes.
        - Biological weathering - involves biological reactions and biological processes.

**Physical weathering**

- - Physical weathering takes place due to - loading or unloading, which means when rocks are loaded by other rocks they break under pressure.
    - Similarly, rocks that were stable under pressure might break down when the overlying rocks are unloaded.
    - Temperature changes and related expansions.
    - Temperature changes may cause expansions and contraction in the rock surfaces.
    - If rock is broken layer by layer it is called exfoliation.
    - Freezing and melting are also called thawing.
    - In thawing the water accumulated in the cracks freezes during very cold temperatures and due to freezing, ice tends to expand and hence it puts pressure on the rocks.
    - Hence by putting pressure like this the rocks gradually break.
    - Salt also on absorbing water swells whereas on drying it contracts.
    - Hence when salts in the rocks tend to become moist, they put pressure on the rocks and break them whereas on drying the pressure reduces.

**Chemical weathering**

- - Chemical weathering involves different chemical reactions which take place with the rocks and gradually break them such as oxidation of rocks, reduction of rocks, solution etc.

**Biological weathering**

- - It involves the actions of plants and animals that break the rock.
    - Decaying of plants in the rocks breaks the rock. 
    - Roots grow in the rocks and break them.
    - Animals decay on the rock, it weathers or breaks the rocks. 
    - Some animals can dig or break rocks.
    - Humans, mine, constructs which contribute to the breaking of the rocks.

##### Mass movement and mass wasting

- - Mass movements (also called mass-wasting) is the down-slope movement of a loose uncemented mixture of soil and rock particles that covers the Earth's surface by the force of gravity without the aid of a transporting medium such as water, ice, or wind. 
    - Types of mass movements- Slow mass movements and rapid mass movements.
        - The slow mass - movements have two parts, soil creep and solifluction.
        - Slow mass movement is the imperceptible slow movement of weathered soil material downslope.

**Slow mass movement**

- - The slow mass movement is generally not perceptible to our eyes and rather we realise that it is taking place only when over a long period the removed material or the accumulated material become the evidence.
    - The slow mass movements are further divided into soil creep which takes place in water unsaturated regions and hence there is no excessive water in the soil.
    - The presence of water lubricates the soil and makes the soil movement easier.
        - Solifluction takes place similar to soil creep with the only major difference being that here the soil is saturated with water and hence has surplus water available.

**Rapid movements**

- - Earth-flow takes place when the soil is moving visibly but the soil is not water-saturated.
    - The soil is held by some vegetation cover.
    - In the case of mud-flow, the soil is relatively saturated with water and the soil movement takes place in the absence of vegetation cover.
    - A huge amount of snow slipping of a slope at a very fast pace is called a snow avalanche.
    - In a debris avalanche, debris means the waste of weathered broken rock material accumulated in the upper parts of hills or mountains.
    - When such a huge amount of debris tends to slip over the hill slope at a relatively fast speed we call it, debris avalanche.
    - It is like a snow avalanche but the snow is replaced by debris.

##### Landslide

- - It takes place when a part of the land on the hill weathers and tends to slip off on a relatively large scale.
    - This normally happens when either due to earthquakes or large explosions such as dynamite explosions or excessive rainfall causing the water to seep deep into the hills.
    - Hence a relatively deeper and bigger part of the slope breaks off.
    - We get a lot of earthquakes and explosions in the Himalayas due to construction and also due to heavy rains in some areas.
    - In the western ghats, though earthquakes do not take place, heavy rainfalls are a major cause of landslides especially in the southern hills like Nilgiris.

##### Transportation and erosion

- - 5 agents of erosion assisted by gravity - Rivers and rains, glaciers, ocean waves, groundwater and winds.

**Type of erosion**

**Corrasion and Abrasion**

- - In this relatively bigger rock parts such as gravel, pebble etc are rubbed in motion by relatively smaller parts such as sand or silt and the bigger parts get broken into smaller parts.
    - This takes place in all types of in all five agents of erosion.

**Attrition**

- - In attrition, similar size rock parts rub against each other while in motion and break into relatively smaller parts.
    - It also takes place in all 5 agents.

**Corrosion**

- - It takes place in water-based mediums, such as fluvial or river water, glacial water, ocean wave movements and groundwater.
    - It does not take place in aeolian erosion, especially when the wind is dry.

**Hydraulic action**

- - It takes place when relatively fast-moving water due to its flow-related pressure tend to break down rocks and their parts.
    - This takes place mostly in ocean waves and river water breaking coastal rocks and rocks in waterfalls.

**Plucking**

- - This takes place only in glacial agents which tends to pluck the rocks and form tills.

**Deflation**

- - Deflation takes place only due to winds.

## Landforms

- - Landform basically means any unique feature on the land which we can see, we call as landforms.
    - The five agents form denudation from their own unique landscapes, which are the pieces of evidence that in a given region which agent is dominantly forming landforms.
    - Groundwater landforms are mostly formed in calcium-rich rock regions because calcium dissolves in water and hence gets eroded and forms different landforms.
    - These calcium-rich regions are also called limestone regions.
    - Such limestone landform regions are also called karst regions.
    - The five agents of denudation are mainly associated with the erosional processes and the depositional processes and hence these five agents of denudation mainly form different landforms either by erosion or by deposition.
    - Hence all the landforms due to exogenic geomorphic processes can broadly be grouped into erosional landforms or depositional landforms due to one of the five agents.

#### _Endogenic geomorphic landforms_

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 21.png>)

#### _Exogenic geomorphic landforms_ 

- - Fluvial (river) Erosional and depositional landforms.
    - Aeolian (wind) Erosional and depositional landforms.
    - Glacial Erosional and depositional landforms.
    - Coastal waves Erosional and depositional landforms.
    - Karts Erosional and depositional landforms.

##### Landforms of fluvial (Riverine) Process

- - Rivers are natural medium or large streams of water flowing on the land surface, carrying water for the most part of the year, if not all part of the year.
    - They generally start from high altitude places such as mountains or plateaus, flowing due to gravity to the lowest place possible which is generally the mean sea level then the river flows into the sea and that location is called the mouth of the river.
    - But, some rivers do not reach up to the ocean and water dries before they reach the ocean such as the Ghaghra river in Haryana or Luni river in Rajasthan. These are called inland drainage rivers.
    - Every river has a course of life generally starting from high elevation regions and ending in the oceans.
    - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 12.jpeg>)

**Phases of rivers**

- - Youthful stage - Fast erosion. First phase.
    - Moderate - Both erosion and deposition.
    - Mature stage - Finest silt is found here. More deposition.

**What all materials are carried by the river**

- - When these rivers come to the mature stage they start to deposit first the boulder(big rocks), then the rocks, pebbles(rounded rocks) and gravels(1-2 mm), sand(0.05-1 mm), silt(05-0.005), clay( <.005 mm) — this are the unresolved matters. 
    - Different salts are also present in river water ( very low concentration ) and they are dissolved in water. 
    - Parallel to the foothills of the Himalayas towards to India, Nepal-Bhutan side we find the initial deposits of the Himalayan rivers, namely - boulders, rocks, pebbles and gravels. — This region is known as the Bhabar region. — this is where the river disappears between rocks ( flowing below the rocks on the ground surface ). 
    - The Bhabar will continue up to Assam.
    - Hence this is Not very fertile, and only deep-rooted trees etc grows here.
    - South of the Bhabar region, we find another parallel belt having deposits of sand and silt, it is called the wet or Terai region.
    - The terai region has a width of 10 to 20 km.
    - It continues from Kashmir up to Assam.
    - This is a naturally dense vegetated region as the river reappears over the sandy silty soils.
    - As the tributary rivers continue to flow and meet their main rivers , They tend to deposit some of the silt on their way as also they tend to pass on their remaining silt and clay to the main river.
    - The north-western part where the Indus, Yamuna and Ganga flow, region is relatively higher in altitude.
    - Hence slightly more slowly and hence deposited by the sand and silt of Indus tributaries and Ganga and Yamuna.
    - It is known as the Bhangar region, sandy-silty and coarser soil.
    - The central and eastern part of Ganga and where it meets the Brahmaputra around Assam-Bangladesh.
    - The region is relatively low-lying and hence has finer silt and clay deposits known as the khadar region.
    - This way the Bhabar, Terai, bhangra and khadar together make the north Indian plains stretching from the Jammu Kashmir region up to the Assam region south and parallel to the Himalayas.

**Deltas**

- - A river delta is a landform created by the deposition of sediment that is carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower-moving or stagnant water.
    - This occurs where a river enters an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or another river that cannot carry away the supplied sediment.

Erosional - pools, sinkholes, Lapies, Limestone pavements.

Depositional - stalactites(hangs), stalagmites(rises up) and pillars

# Winds | Aeolian Landforms

- - Erosional - Pediments and Pediplain, Playas, deflation hollows and caves, mushroom, table and pedestal rocks
        - Erosion is carried in three ways - deflation(removing unsorted dust particles), abrasion(sand grains particles eroding rocks), attrition(wear and tear of sand).

# Climate

## Atmosphere

**Energy in the atmosphere** 

- - Energy in the atmosphere (Energy budget/heat budget). Earth's interior energy is negligible as compared to solar energy. Vertical and horizontal.
    - A vertical heat budget is a balanced budget in terms of received and returned - Net saved = zero.
    - Heat Energy - Latent and specific.
    - Measuring latent heat is not easy.
    - Earth average temperature has not changed substantially over the last nearly 4 billion years.
    - Anything in the universe above absolute zero temperature releases heat.
    - The hotter equatorial tropical regions have a net surplus heat budget whereas the cooler polar regions have a net deficit heat budget when seen horizontally over the earth's surface.

**Factors/elements of Weather and Climate**

- - Temperature.
    - Precipitation.
    - Winds.
    - Humidity.
    - Pressure.
    - Visibility.
    - Sunlight.
    - Clouds.
    - Different phenomenon over a short period is called weather phenomena and over a long period, they are called climatic phenomenon.

##### Composition of the atmosphere

- - Gases in the atmosphere - nitrogen, oxygen, argon etc.
    - The atmosphere ends vertically at a height of 3500 km within mean sea level. (NCERT)
    -  But, some other sources might state up to 10000 km because generally up to there some hydrogen gases have been found, (only trace amount).
    - Apart from the gases, there are other particles also such as dust particles and water vapours.
    - The atmospheric gases are found up to a height of _88 km from the mean sea level in the same proportion as given in the composition table._
    - This region is called the homosphere because it is homogenous in composition.
    - The other region 88-3500 km is called heterogeneous because the densest gases like nitrogen, oxygen are only found in the lowest levels whereas the lighter gases are only found in the highest levels.
    - The dust particle in the atmosphere is only found in the lowest layer of the atmosphere which is the troposphere.
    - Because the dust particle mostly originates from the land surface and the ocean hence most of the dust particles are concentrated near the earth surface.
    - Even in the troposphere, they grew out thinning as we go higher.
    - The dust particle mostly originates from sea salt, fine soil particles, smoke, soot (unburnt particle), ash, pollen and meteor dust.
    - The water vapours in the atmosphere vary from 4% of the total atmospheric composition which is the maximum to less than 1% of the total atmospheric composition normally in the desert regions.
    - Most of the water vapour is also found only in the troposphere.
    - Water vapour is added by evaporation, transpiration and sublimation.

- - **Dust particles and water vapours**
        - Many dust particles have a hygroscopic nature and due to this, they tend to play a major role in the formation of or condensation of water vapour back into water droplets.
        - By this process, it leads to the formation of different suspended atmospheric water bodies like clouds, mist, fog, dew and frost etc.
        - Dust particles play the role of hygroscopic molecules.
        - All of these are formed due to the role of dust particles which play the role of hygroscopic molecules.
        - Dust particles are formed near the land and when we go higher dust particles reduce.

### Structure of the atmosphere

- - It can be understood based on temperature variation and composition.
    - On basis of chemical composition - homogenous and heterogeneous.

**Atmospheric structure on the basis of temperature**

As we go higher in atmosphere, temp decreases by normal lapse rate.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 32.png>)

##### Troposphere

- - Extends up to 8km on poles and up to 18 km on the equator.
    - Because the temperature around the equatorial region is hotter and at poles, it is cooler, the air around the equatorial region heat up - expands - becomes lighter and hence rises.
    - The opposite happens on poles.
    - The air mixes up in the atmosphere.
    - It is the sphere of mixing of the air, hence the name troposphere (Tropo = mixing).
    - The tropopause is the region where the mixing of the air comes to an end and hence it separates the troposphere from the above spheres.
    - Beyond the troposphere, there is no season, weather or climate.
    - All the atmospheric horizontal heat transfer takes place here and hence most of the weather and climatic phenomena take place here.
    - As we go higher in the atmosphere the air tends to cool because rising air expands, hence lesser inter-particle friction and collision and hence lesser temperature.
    - The average fall in temperature with height in the troposphere is around 1 degree Celsius for every 165 meters of rising, which is nearly 6-6.5 degrees fall for every 1 km rise - Normal lapse rate.
        - 1 degree reduction in for 165 m increase in height.
    - Temperature at Tropopause above the equator is -80 and above pole is -45.
    - Tropopause in mid-latitudes during summer is higher, around 15 km.
    - The tropopause in the mid-latitude during winters is lower around 12.5 km.

##### Stratosphere

- - Because the UV radiations coming from the upper part of the space hence most of the UV is absorbed in the upper part of the ozone region and hence as we go higher in the stratosphere the temperature again starts to increase.
    - All UVC, some UVB is absorbed in the ozone layer and all UVA passes through it.
    - The ozone layer absorb the UV radiation and most of this absorbed UV radiation is released back at the same layer as heat energy.
    - By the time we reach stratopause the temperature increase to around -15 degrees to -2.5 degrees.
    - The layer of the atmosphere lies between the troposphere and the mesosphere.
    - The lower portion of the stratosphere is nearly isothermal (a layer of constant temperature), whereas temperatures in its upper levels increase with altitude.
    - The temperature inversion happens because as sun rays comes down in stratosphere there is less and less rays for absorption, the isothermal layer is due to the balanced effect by heat given off by earth.

##### Mesosphere

- - It is the region where most of the particles falling from space ultimately fully get burnt.
    - It goes to around 80kms from MSL.
    - The temperature decreases and is around minus 100 degrees. — it is the coldest natural place in earth’s system.

##### Thermosphere

- - The thermosphere extends up to a height of 400 km above mean sea level.
    - Here, the air density becomes very thin and hence very few gas particles, far separated from each other.
    - The temperature shoots up to 1500 degrees.
    - The heated gas particles turn into ions and hence we call the region an ionosphere.
    - Ions are electrically charged particles.
    - Because of these electrically charged particles, the ionosphere can deviate the radio waves.
    - Radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer.
    - Auroras are created around the Ionosphere region when solar charged particles and ionosphere particle interacts with the earth's magnetic field. (solar charged particles are electrically charged particles).

##### Exosphere

- - Extends up to 3500 Km.
    - Particles are much rare and are hotter.
    - The temperature at exopause is the same as the surface of the sun and the earth's centre (around 5000 degrees celsius).

### Heating and cooling of the atmosphere

- - The earth gets nearly 2 billionth parts which mean 2 parts out of a billion parts of the total heat released by the sun.
    - It is nearly 1.94 calories per square cm per minute on top of the atmosphere(exosphere).
    - Hence two billionth part of the sun's heat that we receive, we call incoming solar radiation or we call it insolation.
    - The insolation mainly has visible light (VIBGYOR) and infrared radiation.
    - The UV radiation also reaches close to the earth surface but finally gets absorbed by ozone.
    - The insolation received on the earth surface is not the same but varies from place to place.
    - There are different factors that affect insolation received at different places on the earth's surface.

**Factors affecting insolation received on the earth's surface**

- - Rotation of the earth - night side, no sunlight and dayside different amount of sunlight during different parts of the daylight.
    - Revolution of the earth - it alone has a very negligible role in insolation variation on the earth if considered without the tilted axis of the earth.
    - Earth's shape - the earth shape (spherical) gives every location on the earth a slightly different inclination with respect to the falling sun rays.
    - The inclination of the earth itself with respect to the revolution orbit of the earth due to which we get the seasons.
    - Inclination also gives us the different duration of daylight and night hence affecting the total insolation received.
    - Affect of slope - slope toward the sun receive more sunlight and vice versa in mountainous regions.
    - Aspect effect - one side of the slope receives more sunlight(sunlight facing) and one side receives less in the mountains.
    - Transparency of the atmosphere - cloudy regions and dusty regions will have less transparency and hence low sunlight.
    - Sunspots also impact the amount of insolation received due to the dark sunspots created due to localised magnetic fields on the sun's surface. 
    - Sunspots have a cycle of 11 years and do have some effect on the insolation.

**Insolation received at different places on the earth's surface**

- - On earth's surface, in a tropical region, we receive a minimum of 70 watts per meter square of sunlight and a maximum of 320 watts per meter square.
    - On the equator, we receive less than 320 watts per meter square of sunlight.
    - Near the oceanic regions, the insolation is relatively lesser than in the continental interior due to low humidity and cloudiness.

**Processes involved in heating**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 33.png>)

- - The region of the atmosphere which is directly in contact with a hotter surface is heating due to _conduction._
    - The upper atmospheric air above the hotter region will get heated due to _convection._
    - Radiation does not need moving particles, wherever sunlight reaches, some heating will occur due to _radiation._
    - With respect to the atmosphere heating, there are two parts of the radiation that we talk of - insolation (direct sunlight) and Terrestrial radiation.
    - Both types of radiation heat the atmosphere but insolation heats very less directly and terrestrial radiation, high heating.
    - _Radiation_ depends on the temperature of the surface.
    - The low energy terrestrial radiation is easier to block for the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which first absorbs this heat and then hence heats up the atmosphere.
    - Hence the troposphere mostly gets heated by terrestrial radiation whereas the insolation (higher energy radiation) easily passes through the troposphere and hence heats it lesser.
    - Almost the whole of the atmosphere will get heated by radiation.
    - The lower part of the troposphere is more heated and the upper part is less heated.

- - Condensational heat release in the atmosphere in addition to the 4 processes written above.
    - The transfer of heat or matter by the flow of a fluid, especially horizontally in the atmosphere or the sea is called advection.

##### Vertical heating and cooling of the atmosphere/Vertical heat budget

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 34.png>)

- - The earth receives a certain amount of insulation (short waves) and gives back heat into space by terrestrial radiation (longwave radiation).
    - Through this inflow and outflow of heat, the earth maintains a constant temperature and this phenomenon is referred to as the heat budget of the earth.
    - Consider that the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere is 100 per cent.
    - While passing through the atmosphere some amount of energy is reflected, scattered and absorbed.
    - Only the remaining part reaches the earth surface.
    - Roughly 35 units are reflected back to space even before reaching the earth’s surface.
    - Of these, 27 units are reflected back from the top of the clouds and 2 units from the snow and ice-covered areas of the earth.
    - The reflected amount of radiation is called the albedo of the earth.
    - The remaining 65 units are absorbed, 14 units within the atmosphere and 51 units by the earth’s surface.
    - The earth radiates back 51 units in the form of terrestrial radiation.
    - Of these, 17 units are radiated to space directly and the remaining 34 units are absorbed by the atmosphere (6 units absorbed directly by the atmosphere, 9 units through convection and turbulence and 19 units through latent heat of condensation).
    - 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (14 units from insolation + 34 units from terrestrial radiation) are also radiated back into space.
    - Thus, the total radiation returning from the earth and the atmosphere respectively is 17+48=65 units which balance the total of 65 units received from the sun.
    - Reflected back (2%) heat doesn't play any role in the heating of the atmosphere.
    - **The 65% heat stored temporarily with the earth system keeps the earth system relatively warm.**
    - But, ultimately even this 65% of the heat is finally released back to space making the earth's net budget a balanced budget.
    - 23% is radiated by the earth system.
    - 9% is released by convection to the atmosphere.
    - Only 17% is released back to the space and the remaining 34% is first absorbed by the atmosphere which plays a major role in heating the atmosphere.
    - Because this heat is released from the bottom of the troposphere hence the bottom of the troposphere gets most heated and therefore we say the troposphere is heated most by terrestrial radiation.
    - This way the atmosphere had 14% earlier and 34% more adding to it hence a total of 48% is added to the atmosphere directly or indirectly.
    - This 48% of the heat keeps the atmosphere warm in fulfilling the goldilocks zone condition and hence supporting life.
    - But till this heat remains in the atmospheric system, it keeps the atmosphere warm by atmospheric radiation.
    - The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hold up 48% of heat in the atmosphere.
    - Though the 48% heat is not held up forever in the atmosphere, it is constantly present in the atmosphere to keep it continuously warm.
    - If the content of greenhouse gases increases especially by abnormal or unnatural interventions like human intervention, it can cause an unnatural increase in the overall earth's temperature.
    - The kind of global warming we are experiencing presently.

**Horizontal heat budget** 

- - As we see in the horizontal heat budget that the lower latitude regions are in the net heat surplus region whereas the higher latitude regions are a net deficit region.
    - But, because the whole earth on average has a balanced heat budget.
    - Therefore the surplus heat is transferred to the deficit regions.

A) through the atmosphere which hence created different weather and climatic phenomena giving us different weathers, seasons and climates in different regions.

B) through the ocean creating different movements and related phenomena in the ocean.

- - This is how different weather and climate are created on the earth.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 35.png>)

## Weather and Climate

- - Some climates have distinct seasons - Summer, winter, autumn and spring.
    - The most important similarity between weather, seasons and climate is primarily the 8 elements that we use to objectively quantify these three phenomena.
    - 8 Elements - Temperature, pressure, winds, humidity - condensation, clouds, precipitation, visibility and sunshine.

### Temperature

- - Temperature is the measure of the specific heat of a body.
    - The lowest temperature possible is zero kelvin - absolute zero.
    - The average temperature of the universe is -270 degree. 
    - Important of temperature;
        - The basic requirement of the goldilocks zone.
        - Energy always flows from high to low.
        - It also decides the moisture content in the atmosphere.
        - More temperature implies More possibility of evaporation if the moisture is available and also a higher capacity of the air to hold moisture.
        - Warmer air has more potential to hold moisture.
        - This does not mean every time air temperature is high, it has more moisture.
    - On earth, different regions have different temperatures.

**Different factors which affect the temperature in different regions** 

- - **_Latitude_** - temperature increases from the equator to tropic and then decreases from tropics to poles.
    - **_Altitude_** - The lapse rate during summers is higher as also during daytime.
    - On the other hand, the lapse rate during winter is low as also during night-time.
    - During night-time or winter, the earth's surface temperature at mean sea level is also low.

- - _Continentality and maritime effects_ - During the colder period land become very cold and during warmer period it becomes very hot, whereas water has the tendency to be less cold during colder period and less warm during warmer period.
    - Water or water bodies need to exchange more heat for bringing a 1-degree change in temperature whereas land bodies need less heat to change the temperature by 1 degree.
    - In summers if you are standing in the middle of the continent and middle of the ocean (same day, same latitude and same time), more heat will be felt more on the continent.
    - This is called continentality.
    - The continent has a more severe temperature and oceans have a moderating behaviour with respect to temperature.

- - **Continentality:**
        - **Severing character**
        - **When we are talking about the interior of a continent, continentality means the regions away from the coast.**
        - **When we are talking about oceans the continentality means parts of the ocean closer to the continent.**
    - **Maritime influence (Ocean currents)**
        - **Moderating character**
        - **Maritime means regions of the ocean away from the continent's coast.**
        - **Generally, we talk about the maritime effect on the continent.**
        - **It means coastal regions are affected by the ocean.**
        - **Ocean Currents are of 2 types:**
            - **Surface ocean currents and**
            - **Deep ocean currents**
    - Surface ocean currents affect the temperature of the coastal regions —- they are unidirectional, generally around the year, wide(100-200km) flow of water in the ocean. If they come from colder region we call them cold currents and visa versa. 
    - Warm current moving to coastal regions makes such coast relatively warm and visa versa.
    - The moderating character of maritime regions means that such regions during summers remain relatively less hot.
    - Whereas during winters they remain relatively less cold.

- - **Airmass**
        - **Huge parcel of air having uniform characteristics such as temperature or humidity, spreading over thousands of Kms and stretching up to the tropopause.**
        - **Because they have uniform character, they are called warm or cold air mass wrt each other.**
        - **Warm air masses, if they move to colder regions they make such regions relatively warmer.**
        - **Whereas cold air masses make a warm region relatively cooler.**

- - **Slope, Shelter, and aspect:**
        - **The slope is cooler than flat regions and shelter is cooler than sunny regions**
        - **Aspect: The sun-facing side is warmer.(example of Himalayas)**
    - **Natural Vegetation:**
        - **Moderating effect**
        - **Cooling effect in warm areas and a warming effect in cool areas.**
    - **Types of surface:**
        - **Wet surfaces have a moderating effect and Dry surface has a severing effect**
        - **The albedo effect also plays a role.**
        - **Light surfaces reflect sunlight and as a result, are cooler.(have less albedo)**
        - **While dark surfaces absorb light and as a result are warmer(Have high albedo)**

**Temperature distribution on Earth's surfaces**

- - Isotherms are the lines connecting places with similar temperatures.
    - If we consider only the effect of latitudes and not of others then in some ways we find that latitudes also tend to behave like isotherms.
    - Considering only the latitude factor, we can generally arrange the isotherms parallel to the latitudes.
    - Assuming the Earth was only made of oceans, one can say that isotherms would be parallel to latitudes.

##### How does the presence of continents affect the isotherms?

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 36.png>)

- - If there is no continent then the summer region isotherm would have been parallel to latitudes.
    - But due to the presence of continents, the isotherms have been bent, and as we can see the summer isotherms are bent poleward over the continents due to continentality.
    - We can say this in another way that **during summers** if we go along the isotherms from oceans to continents then the isotherms bent poleward.
    - Whereas if we go from continent to oceans the isotherms bent equatorward.
    - On the contrary, during winters when we travel along the isotherms from oceans towards continents, the isotherms bend equatorward.
    - The bending is more in Northern Hemisphere.
    - Isotherms are relatively parallel over the southern hemisphere.
    - The average temperature of the Earth is 15 degrees Celsius.
    - The summer maximum temperature noted anywhere on the Earth is 60 degrees.
    - It is 45 degrees more than average.
    - The lowest temperature is noted in the Arctic and Siberian region.
    - It is close to -80 degrees Celsius.
    - Hence the most extreme temperature on the Earth is experienced during Winters.
    - Hence, the isotherms bend relatively more in the winter season (December-January).

**Temperature range**

- - It means the deviation in the temperature from the normal temperature.
    - The temperature ranges are measured both annually as well as daily(diurnal).
    - In the case of annual, we talk about the coldest month average and hottest month average.
    - In the case of diurnal, we talk about the coldest temperature and hottest temperature of the day.
    - Some regions have a high diurnal range where the daytime temperature is very high and same day's night time temperature is very low.
    - The maximum diurnal range (means maximum temperature range within a day, the range b/w afternoon and the same day’s late midnight) is found in tropical deserts.
    - e.g. Thar desert, Sahara desert.
    - Diurnal Range is very less in equatorial coastal regions.
    - The maximum annual range is found in the Siberian region.
    - The minimum annual range/diurnal range is found in Equatorial coastal regions.

##### Temperature inversion

- - Temperature inversion is the special case where vertically the temperature change reverses in the atmosphere.
    - It means the temperature starts increasing with an increase in altitude.
    - There is no fixed rate for temperature inversion.
    - It varies from situation to situation.
    - Different types of Inversions:
        - 1. Radiation inversion: It takes place in plains.
        - 2. Subsidence inversion: It takes place in mountains and valleys.
        - 3. Marine inversion: It takes place in coastal regions specially where sea temp gets colder.
        - 4. Frontal inversion: It takes place when fronts are formed between air masses, especially during the occlusion of fronts.

**Radiation inversion:**

- - Conditions: Cold winter nights, clear sky, still air or very slow winds.
    - During the night in winter, the earth’s surface tends to radiate (heat radiated is more than heat absorbed.)
    - Hence the surface cools down.
    - Temperature decreases as per altitude:
    - Surface: warm, mid-altitude: cool, high altitude: cooler.
    - But during winter nights: Earth’s surface will become cooler than the air at lower altitudes gets cooler with it( against the normal lapse rate).
    - Hence we experience radiation inversion.
    - Above certain altitudes, the temperature will start decreasing again (normal conditions).
    - The clear skies allow the radiated heat to scape through the troposphere as there are no clouds to absorb and reflect back this heat. If clouds are present they do not let the heat to escape and some of the heat is reflected back to plains and will not let the plains to cool down. —— hence no inversion.

**Role of clouds:**

- - Radiated heat escapes through the troposphere, as there are no clouds to absorb and reflect back this heat.
    - If clouds are present, they do not let the heat to escape, and some of the heat will be reflected back to the plains and will not let plains to cool down.

**Role of winds:**

- - If winds are strong, They might remove the cool air; hence inversion type conditions will not form.
    - Radiation inversion can lead to the formation of dew and frost condensation on the earth’s surface, and also fog and mist condensation in the lowest layer of the troposphere.

**Subsidence/Valley Inversion:**

- - It takes place between the valleys between the hills.
    - As the air between valleys becomes cold, it also becomes dense.
    - Dense air tends to go down the valley.
    - From hill slopes, it tends to go down the valley.
    - The warmer valley air will be lifted up.
    - During cold nights on the hill-upper slopes, the air cools down, and hence syncs, hence the denser air goes down the slope into the valley.
    - And the warmer lighter valley air is lifted up. 
    - Hence inversion conditions are created in the valley, up to a certain height in the valley.
    - This way the valley gets colder than the slopes of the hill.
    - Hence, in regions where inversion is frequent, and the valley experiences frost and fog frequently, in the valley, the hill residents generally build their homes on the slopes where it is warmer in night, and also agriculture and food crops are grown in the slopes.
    - As frequent fog and frost is harmful for the crops.(contrary is written in NCERT which is wrong)
    - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 19.jpeg>)

**Trapping of cold air:**

- - As shown in the subsidence inversion diagram, The cold surface might get trapped as the warm wind coming from another side of the hill envelopes, which is lighter also, will trap this cold air.
    - Warm air will not allow it to escape.
    - Lighter warm air will keep moving.
    - Pollutants in the region will also remain trapped in the region, increasing pollution.
    - Even in the plains, due to radiation inversion, when the surface air gets cooled, the pollutants in the air are trapped especially over cities.
    - And the cold air does not rise, because the upper air is relatively warmer, and hence the pollution remains trapped. — this is why there is higher pollution in Delhi during winters. - Temperature Inversion

**Marine Inversion:** 

- - It takes place near colder, oceanic coastal regions.
    - E.g. temperate and sub-polar regions. 
    - It takes place during the Spring season when the winters are over and the summers are about to start.
    - The land becomes warmer faster, and air above the coastal region becomes warmer faster. 
    - At the same time ocean relatively becomes colder, hence the air above the ocean is also relatively cooler.
    - Due to this, when the coastal warmer air tends to rise, the cooler oceanic air moves towards the coastal region.
    - Hence on the coastal regions, inversion conditions are created, known as marine coastal inversion.
    - Frontal Inversion: will be covered when we talk about air masses and fronts.

### Pressure

- - Pressure is force per unit area (by something).
    - Atmospheric pressure is the force per unit area put by air in a region on the surrounding surface.
    - The normal atmospheric pressure that we generally talk about is the atmospheric pressure measured at mean sea level.
    - It is not just the weight of the air, in the atmosphere, but it is due to the weight.
    - Atmospheric pressure acts in all directions.
    - The pressure is measured by a barometer, and we used the unit millibar.
    - Normal atmospheric pressure at Mean Sea Level is 1013.2 millibars.
    - Atmospheric pressure also decreases with height, as the air gets thinner as we go higher.
    - When we talk of the atmospheric pressure on earth, we normally have horizontal pressure on the earth's surface. 
    - Hence, places having the same pressure are shown by a line called an isobar.
    - The normal mean sea level pressure range on the earth is 960 millibar to up to 1040 millibars.
    - The decrease in pressure accounts for 1mb for each 10m increase in elevation.

- - Air movement: 
        - At low pressure: Air enters horizontally and exits vertically.
        - In cold places, high-pressure areas: The air comes ‘vertically in’ and gets horizontally out (downward air will create more weight, high-pressure conditions).
    - Pressures created due to heating and cooling are called as thermally created high pressure and low pressures.
    - When on the surface we have low pressure (e.g. 960 mb), we have relatively high pressure at the tropopause, but not with respect to the earth’s surface pressure. Hence, this upper atmosphere high pressure e.g. 250 mb.
    - When on the earth’s surface, e.g. 1040 mb, then above it in the upper atmosphere, we have relatively low pressure, (e.g. 160 mb), with respect to the upper atmosphere's high pressure (**hence we mostly compare pressure horizontally only**).
    - In order to eliminate the effect of altitude on pressure, it is measured at any station after being reduced to sea level for purposes of comparison.
    - The upper atmosphere high-pressure/low-pressure, are created mechanically.
    - Hence we have learned, that relative high-pressure and low-pressure conditions can be created both mechanically and thermally.

### Wind

- - Near horizontally, the air moves from high pressure to low pressure.
    - Both near the earth's surface or in the atmosphere.
    - This high pressure to low-pressure air movement is called as ‘wind’.
    - The wind blows because of a pressure difference between the two such locations. 
    - Simply said, if there is a pressure difference, horizontally or near horizontally, between two locations, then wind will blow between such two places. 
    - Vertical movement of air is called as draft (updraft: air going up, or downdraft).
    - Drafts are not only because of pressure but mainly due to gravity and buoyancy. 
    - The pressure difference tells us the direction of the winds.

**Pressure Gradient and the related wind speed and wind strength:**

- - Gradient is the rate of change of a given thing between two locations. 
    - Hence, the Pressure gradient is the rate of change of pressure between two locations per unit distance. 
    - It is generally seen, more the gradient faster or stronger winds flows/moves from higher to lower value.
    - Hence, understanding the rule of pressure gradient, that higher the gradient will cause faster movement from high point to low point.

##### Factors which affect the wind:

- - In wind movement there are two parts:
    - Motion/drive of the wind, which causes movement or motion. (Pressure gradient is the driving force of the wind).
    - Steering force: which causes the direction of the wind.(imagine in 3-D)
    - There are three steering forces: 
        - Coriolis Force,
        - Frictional Force
        - Centripetal force: Inward during circular motion. Centrifugal Force: Outward during circular motion. Hence, they cancel each other. 

###### _Coriolis Force_

[The Coriolis Effect Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIyBpi7B-dE)

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 20.jpeg>)

- - **Merry-go-round observation:** 
    - When merry-go-round is rotating clockwise, the ball seems to deflect towards ‘left’.
    - From the North Pole, the earth looks like rotating Anti-Clockwise (objects will seem to deflect to right).
    - From the South Pole, the earth looks like rotating Clockwise (objects will seem to deflect to left).
    - The Coriolis Force hence is a pseudo-force, which seems to deflect long-distance traveling objects, such as winds, ocean currents, airplanes, rockets, missiles, etc., toward the right in North Hemisphere, and towards the left in the Southern Hemisphere.
    - The deflection is zero at the equator, and the maximum deflection is towards the pole. (speed से समझो)
    - Higher the latitude, the more the deflection.
    - If latitude is zero, deflection is also zero.
    - Earth’s rotation is the cause of the Coriolis Force.
    - The more the wind speed, the more will be the Coriolis Force will seem to be.
    - Coriolis force does not change with the movement of sun, it is related with the rotation of earth.

###### _Frictional force:_

- - The frictional force is due to the friction provided to moving objects by Earth’s surface such as land, ocean water, etc.
    - For example, friction to the land and ocean surface. 
    - The friction tends to slow down the speed of the object.
    - More the friction, slower the movement of the object.
    - Hence, the slower the object, the lesser the deflection.
    - More the friction: implies lesser the speed, lesser the speed implies lesser the deflection, and lesser the deflection implies lesser the Coriolis Force.
    - So if we compare, frictional force and Coriolis force tend to oppose each other.
    - Finally, frictional force opposes Coriolis force.
    - Frictional force seems to deflect opposite to Coriolis force.
    - Hence reducing the net deflection.
    - There is no frictional force in the upper troposphere for winds. Because wind cannot give friction to the wind.

#### _Winds on Earth:_

**Winds on the Non-rotating earth**: 

- - On non-rotating earth, there will be a single blanket of air from the poles to the equator.
    - Having low at the equator and high at the pole. 
    - As we see, if the earth was non-rotating, each hemisphere of the earth, N/S, we will get one vertical cell of the air movement rising at the equator and sinking at the pole.
    - But in reality, the earth is rotating.
    - And hence, a more complex formation takes place as discussed below:

**Wind movement on rotating earth:**

- - Coriolis force will act right/left of the moving object. (so In turn would create a circular movement of wind.)

**Formation of Geostrophic wind in the upper atmosphere:**

- - Geostrophic winds are created in the upper atmosphere
    - They move west to east, going round the earth, nearly parallel, and above certain latitudes, e.g. the one that is formed over 30 degrees latitude in both the hemispheres.
    - Similar geostrophic winds are formed above 60 degrees latitude by some complex phenomenon beyond our syllabus.
    - Geostrophic winds help us better understand the wind movement on the rotating earth.

**Tricellular Circulation:**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 37.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 38.png>)

- - As we see, that three cells are created in the atmosphere, the Hadley(0-30 degree), Ferrel(30-60) and Polar(60-90) Cells.
    - This is known as the three cell model or tricellular model which explains the movement in the atmosphere.
    - Due to the tricellular model, as understood above, we get seven pressure regions over the Earth's surface parallel to the latitudes, known as pressure belts.
    - Direction of wind patterns in northern hemisphere is clockwise, whereas in southern hemisphere it is counter clockwise.
    - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 1.gif>)

#### _Pressure Belts:_

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 39.png>)

- - These are: 
        - Belt 1: Equatorial low pressure, Spreading: 10 degrees N/S,
        - Belts 2 and 3: Subtropical High-pressure belts one in each hemisphere formed over 30 degrees, spreading: (from 23.5 to 35 degrees) N and S.
        - Belts 4 and 5: Sub Polar Low-pressure belt: Formed over 60-degree latitude (N/S), spreading between 45 to 66.5 degrees (N/S)
        - Belt 6 and 7: Polar High-Pressure Belts (one each on both poles, above 90 degrees, spreading up to 75-80 degrees latitude).
    - As we see, between the Seven Pressure Belts on the earth, a set of 3 winds blow in each hemisphere, between the high-pressure and low-pressure belts, and also affected by the Coriolis force, which tends to bend them as shown.
    - These three set of winds blow globally generally between 0-30 degrees, 30 and 60 degrees and 60 and 90 degrees.
    - Hence, they are also known as global surface winds or global winds.

**The naming of winds:**

- - The rule for the naming of winds is : they are named on the basis of the direction from which they come.
    - The naming of winds is done on the basis of the direction from which they are coming from.
    - E.g. Wind coming from the west will be called as westerly.
    - Winds between 0 to 30 are called as easterly winds.
    - The 30-60 N/S: the winds are called as westerly winds.
    - The 60-90 N/S: the winds are called as easterly winds.
    - Westerly of Northern Hemisphere is called South Westerly.
    - Westerly of South Hemisphere is called as North Westerly. And so on.

**Breaking of Pressure Belts:**

- - **Summer effect on the pressure Belt:**
        - In the month of June, when summer is there in NH, how these pressure belts are broken, is as given below: 
        - In summer, in the equatorial region, it will be hot only over the ocean or the continent, supporting the equatorial low-pressure belt created thermally.
        - In the summers, in polar regions, it remains extremely cold only, supporting the thermally created polar high-pressure belt, both over the ocean and continents.
        - Simply said, during summer, the polar high-pressure belt remains the same, both over the ocean and continents.
        - The sub-polar region does become slightly warm during summer and hence this thermal warm condition supports the mechanical low pressure, in this region.
        - Hence, the sub-polar low-pressure belt is also not adversely affected during the summer season.
        - The subtropical high-pressure regions, become hot during summers.
        - The continental regions become very hot, creating thermal low-pressure conditions over the continent, which oppose the mechanical high-pressure condition in this region.
        - _If the thermal low-pressure is very strong, it rather breaks the subtropical high-pressure belt over the continent, creating a local sub-tropical low-pressure cell over the continent._
        - _Over the oceans of sub-tropical regions, the temperature is not very hot, hence very strong low-pressure cells are not created there._
        - Hence, though, the broken parts of subtropical high-pressure belts now called cells, though weakened, still remain over the oceans as high-pressure cells.

- - **Winter effect on Pressure Belts:**
        - In the winter season, the equatorial region remains hot, over ocean and land, so the equatorial low-pressure belt continues, both over ocean and land.
        - The polar region becomes very cold, strengthening the polar high-pressure belt.
        - The sub-tropical region also becomes cold, hence creating, thermal high-pressure, which supports the subtropical high-pressure belt. 
        - Sub-Polar regions become extremely cold, especially over the continent, hence creating extremely cold High-pressure conditions over the continent, which opposes and hence breaks the sub-polar low-pressure belts only over continents. Though over oceans, they are weakened but not broken.
        - Hence, broken parts of the sub-polar belt, become sub-polar low-pressure cells over oceans, whereas, on continents, a sub-polar high-pressure cell is created.

**Effect of breaking of Pressure cells:**

- - In the summer over the continent, we have the sub-polar low-pressure belt and subtropical low-pressure cell, hence the pressure difference becomes less, hence westerly becomes weak.
    - In the winter season, over the continent, the sub-tropical region has a high-pressure belt, and the sub-polar region has a low-pressure cell.
    - Hence, the pressure difference between these two regions becomes, hence westerlies are again weakened over the continents in winters.
    - Hence westerlies are generally weak over the continent, they are strong only over the oceans.

**Shifting of Pressure Belts:**

- - We know that around the year, the sun apparently shifts from Tropic of Capricorn around December to equator around March, and Tropic of Cancer around June, and then again returns back to equator around September, further going toward Tropic of Capricorn towards December, completing one cycle of the year.
    - Hence we see, that for six months the sun keeps shifting Northwards from the Tropic of the Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer, and the subsequent six months shifts southwards from the Tropic of Cancer to Tropic of Capricorn.
    - We also know, that the equatorial low-pressure belt is created around the equator, when we consider the sun’s position over the equator.
    - And the subtropical and subpolar pressure belts are subsequently created between equatorial low and polar high.
    - Hence simply said, the sub-tropical and sub-polar pressure belts are created indirectly due to the equatorial low-pressure belt, polar high-pressure belt, the Earth’s rotation and the resultant global winds.
    - But because the sun keeps shifting round the year, hence it does not always remain over equator, and hence the equatorial low-pressure belt does not always remain over the equator.
    - Rather, the equatorial low-pressure belt keeps shifting, along with the shifting of the sun.
    - Hence, as the sun shifts towards the Tropic of Cancer, the equatorial low-pressure belt tries to follow it.
    - Though, the pressure belt shifting is not by 231/2 degrees, and rather the pressure-belt shifts only by 5-10 degrees maximum.
    - Hence, the equatorial low-pressure belt is around the equator during March and September. From March to June it shifts towards the Tropic of Cancer (by 5 to 10 degrees).
    - From June to September, it shifts back towards the equator, from September to December, it shifts towards the tropic of Capricorn by 5-10 degrees.
    - And December to March shifts back towards the equator. 
    - A very important point is that as the equatorial low-pressure belt shifts in one direction, because the other pressure belts are also related to equatorial pressure belts( subtropical and sub polar ), hence they also shift in the same direction(5-10 degrees max).
    - Hence, as we see, in the pressure-belt shifting diagram, that all the three pressure belts, Equatorial Low (EL), Sub Tropical High, and Sub Polar Low, shift with the shifting of the sun.
    - Because, we know that, the global winds tropical easterlies, westerlies, and polar easterlies, are created between two subsequent pressure belts, hence, we can also understand, that as the pressure belt shift, the global winds will also shift.

**Effects of the wind shifting:**

- - Hence the shifting of global winds with the shifting of pressure-belts though does not affect the regions in the middle of the wind belts but the regions on the edge of the wind belts or the pressure belt regions, as the pressure and wind belt shifts, such regions also experience different global winds, during different parts of the year.
    - For example, at 30 degrees North latitude, during June, when the wind-belts have shifted northwards, the North East trade winds(tropical easterlies) will blow.
    - Six months later in December, when wind belts have shifted maximum southwards, by (5-10 degrees) then South Westerlies will blow.
    - Hence, we can conclude that most places on the earth get same global winds around the year (places well inside the wind belts, but few places experience changing global winds with the shifting of pressure belts, because these few places, are located around 30 degrees and 60 degree latitudes, and hence, the pressure belts and related global winds shift across the them)

**Rossby Waves and Jet Streams**

- - These are part of winds in the upper atmosphere.
    - Will be covered later.
    - Surface global winds are called as ‘Primary Winds’.

**Flow of the winds:**

- - Similar to the flow of the river (which has a unidirectional flow of water round the year).
    - Within this unidirectional flow, we also get to see, some whirlpool type of movements.
    - The whirlpool also flows with the river, as a part of river, they are neither very big, nor very small. 
    - There are further smaller flows in the river, which are the third level of flow in the river, like the water going up-down a stone or rock in the river, or water narrowing between two rocks in a river.
    - Third flow: These are the smaller local flows in the river.
    - Similarly, the winds being fluid, like water also create 3 levels of flow, over the earth.
        - First: The Primary Winds, which are like the rivers themselves, also called ‘global winds’.
        - Second: The Atmospheric Whirlpools, which are the secondary winds, which are the one example of secondary winds, or second type of circulation, taking place within the global winds
        - Third: The Tertiary Winds (also called the Local Winds): Which are the third level of flow, like the water around the rocks in the river.
    - The monsoon winds in India, which are seasonal are also an example of Secondary winds.
    - Hence secondary winds are also called as seasonal winds.

##### Primary Winds

**Tropical Easterlies Characteristics:**

- - They are mostly driven by the more fundamental equatorial low-pressure belts, and hence generally they are strong global winds. Blowing nearly round the year, between nearly 10-30 degrees latitude (tropical region).
    - Here they are known as trade winds, because earlier traders used to sail, using these strong constant winds round the year.
    - They have good moisture-holding capacity because they are warm/hot.
    - Between 0 to 10 degrees, as they horizontally converge to rise vertically, hence at the equatorial region, we have very less winds (as winds are vertically rising Equatorial Low Pressure). Hence this region is also known as Doldrums (very less wind, due to low pressure).
    - This 0 to 10 degrees N/S is called as Equatorial region.
    - 30 to 10 degrees N/S region is called a Tropical region.

**Westerly Wind Characteristics:**

- - They are relatively stronger in the Southern Hemisphere because there is more oceanic region.
    - On continents, the westerlies are weak (Northern Hemisphere).
    - Westerlies in Southern Hemisphere are called by different names:
        - Roaring Forties (40 degrees South)
        - Furious Fifties (50 degrees South)
        - Shrieking Sixties (60 degrees South).
    - And westerlies are more parallel to latitudes in Southern Hemisphere because they are very strong.
    - Westerlies are weak and variable winds in Northern Hemisphere over the Continents.
    - Westerlies carry heat from the sub-tropical region (35 degrees to 23.5 degrees), to the mid-latitude (30-60 degrees N) regions and sub-polar regions (around 60 degrees).
    - Westerlies start from Sub-tropical high-pressure belts, and it is generally known that low-pressure regions have strong winds, and high-pressure regions have weak winds.
    - Hence, the sub-tropical high-pressure regions generally have very weak winds. And hence are known as Horse Latitudes (30 latitudes).

**Polar Easterlies**

- - Polar Easterlies are also strong because they start from the thermal polar high-pressure belts.
    - And they carry the colder winds from polar to sub-polar regions, which get warmed in the sub-polar regions.

##### Tertiary Winds (Local Winds)

- - Land and Sea Breeze:
        - Sea Breeze blows during the late afternoon, from sea to land.
        - Land Breeze blows during early morning from land to sea.
    - Valley Breeze and Mountain Breeze:
        - Valley breeze takes place during the daytime, the Mountain breeze takes place during night.
        - Valley breeze causes rains, during day. Known as Anabatic (warming) winds.
        - Mountain breeze blows during night, temperature inversion type condition. Known as Katabatic (cooling winds).
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 40.png>)
    - The third type of winds are the warm and the cold local winds.

### Humidity

- - It is basically the wetness and dampness in the air that we generally feel.
    - Humidity is measured using a Hygrometer.
    - Three types of humidity that we talk about are:

**Absolute humidity:**

- - The measure of actual amount of water vapour present in the air. Here the water vapour is measured in grams and the air we take a unit volume 1 meter cube. Simply said grams of water vapour present in one meter cube is absolute humidity.
    - Absolute humidity tells us how much water vapour is present in the air.
    - Here it should be noted that amount of water vapour present depends on the availability of water sources, e.g. surface water, river water, ocean or soil moisture, etc.
    - The moisture-holding capacity of the air depends on the temperature as the higher the temperature, the more the moisture-holding capacity.
    - But if availability is not there, then capacity does not matter much.

**Relative humidity:**

- - Relative humidity is the ratio, of the actual amount of water vapour present to the maximum amount of water vapour that air can hold at the given temperature.
    - For example, if at 30 degree temperature the maximum possible capacity to hold moisture is 50 grams/volume but in actual air has only 30 grams of water vapour then the RH of such air will be 30gm/50gm i.e. 60% of the capacity.
    - So we say such air has 60% relative humidity.
    - **Dew Point**: If the relative humidity at a given temperature becomes 100%, then we say that the air is saturated with moisture and it can no more hold any moisture.
    - If any excess moisture is present at such temperature, as water vapour, it starts to condense into due.
    - Hence, saturation is also known as Dew Point, because at such temperature, dew formation begins.
    - Moist air, which at a relatively higher temperature is relatively not saturated, can get saturated by gradual cooling. And the temperature where it gets saturated will be called dew point.
    - Any further cooling of air leads to further condensation. 
    - Relative humidity tells us what is the possibility of condensation in the air, as more the relative humidity, the more the possibility of condensation.
    - Specific humidity :- Specific humidity is a measure of the weight of water vapour present per unit weight of air.

**Condensation:**

- - Condensation is gas turning to liquid, due to cooling, hence releasing the heat.
    - Conditions for condensation:
        - It requires cold conditions (either a cold surface, or cold air). Below dew point.
        - It requires a solid surface (either a solid cold surface, e.g. bottle, ground, grass, or it requires dust particles, i.e. hygroscopic particles).

**Results of Condensation:**

- - Dew and frost happen Dew on grass/ground in liquid conditions, frost is solid.
    - In Air: 
        - In the troposphere (upper atmosphere): We get clouds.  
        - In lower atmosphere (near the ground): We get fog and mist.

### Clouds 

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 42.png>)

- - Clouds are a huge bunch of small condensed droplets around hygroscopic particles also called condensation nuclei, in the upper atmosphere.
    - Because they are in the upper atmosphere, hence the height of the cloud is their first basis of classification. 
    - Clouds generally have two parts to their names.
    - Where the first part generally tells their height.
    - The second part of the name will give them their expanse or raininess.

- - Height: Cirrus, Alto, Stratus.
    - Expanse: If they are horizontal in continuous layer - stratus, if the cloud is not continuous, in small spaces, it is called a cumulus.
    - The Raininess of a cloud is referred to by: Nimbus.
    - Above the troposphere we have two more clouds: 
    - Polar stratospheric cloud found just above the tropopause, above poles. They have some role in Ozone hole formation.  
    - They are also related to the Polar Vertex phenomenon.
    - Noctilucent Cloud: These are the clouds in the Mesosphere, generally over the pole, and they shine in the night.

**Characteristics of Clouds**

- - Horizontal clouds cause relatively slower rains.
    - Whereas the vertical clouds, which are like vertical water tanks, cause relatively more intense rain, like the Cumulonimbus Clouds.
    - The altitude of clouds also affects the precipitation from the clouds.
    - For example, we know that we have clouds at high altitudes as well as at low altitudes.
    - For incoming solar radiation, the low clouds are the last barrier, hence more low clouds mean, more reflection of insolation.
    - Hence lesser insolation will come to the surface of earth, and hence the heating of the lower troposphere, where we live will be less.
    - Hence, simply said, more amount of low clouds will mean, the earth will be heated less.
    - More clouds mean less heating of the earth, has an overall cooling effect on the earth.
    - More higher clouds act as the last barrier for outgoing terrestrial radiation, and more amount of high cloud means, terrestrial radiation will be reflected back toward the earth, hence warming the earth surface/region where we live.
    - Hence, simply said, more amount of high clouds like cirrus clouds mean, more warming of the earth.

**Sun's Halo**

- - 22-degree ring that appears due to the dispersion of light passes through ice crystals found in upper-level cirrus clouds, cause the sun's halo to have colours.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 22.jpeg>)

#### _Precipitation:_

- - Precipitation in simple English means settling down of suspended particles.
    - Hence, precipitation in the atmosphere simply means settling down of suspended water droplets in the atmosphere.
    - Here the water droplets are suspended, as clouds.
    - Like the ones we read above.
    - These water droplets are formed around small condensation nuclei, forming small water droplets, which form the cloud, and remain suspended as clouds, because they are too small and light in weight.
    - The precipitation here happens when bigger hygroscopic particles or condensation nuclei reach the upper troposphere due to some specific processes. 
    - In the cloud, around these bigger hygroscopic particles, bigger droplets tend to form.
    - As smaller droplets accumulate around these bigger hygroscopic particles.
    - Hence, these bigger water droplets become heavy enough so as to fall down as precipitation.
    - These bigger drops are what we call as raindrops.
    - Hence this is how rain forms from clouds.
    - When the bigger droplets are formed around bigger condensation nuclei, as the smaller droplets in the cloud accumulate around bigger condensation nuclei, due to more weight, the bigger droplets precipitate towards the ground.
    - This is how rain as precipitation takes place.
    - But rain is not the only form of precipitation, as we also know about other forms, such as sleet, hail, and snow.
    - The other forms of precipitation are as explained below:

**Sleet(ओले) formation:**

- - We should have a layer of very cold (freezing zone) region below the cloud.
    - When rain passes through this region, it will turn into frozen water balls, this is how sleet is formed.
    - Below the clouds, for example extremely cold air from mountains.
    - When the droplets pass through such regions, they freeze into ice balls, known as sleet.
    - After formation, sleet will fall (small spherical ice).

**Hail(बड़े भारी ओले) Formation:**

- - Hail formation also starts similar to sleet formation, but in addition to sleet forming conditions, some additional conditions are also there, such as rising convections, which could be a mechanically rising convection or thermally caused convections.
    - The convections tend to carry back the frozen sleet-like droplets back into the clouds where more water accumulates around the sleet-like frozen balls, and again these bigger size balls fall back through the freezing zone and hence refreeze, forming bigger frozen balls.
    - If the convection is strong enough, and hence the freezing balls are carried back and forth a few times, it can lead to the frozen balls becoming bigger and bigger.
    - Ultimately, causing them to precipitate back on the ground as hail.
    - Hail might form in hilly areas or even in plains and can also form during summers, due to thermal convection.
    - For example, hail forms in India even during summers in regions such as Jharkhand, Odisha, UP, Bihar.

**Snow Formation**

- - Snow formation takes place in region where the cloud itself, is in a subfreezing zone.
    - Like in temperate regions in winter or polar regions, or on the mountain top in tropical regions.
    - Snow or snowflakes grow around hygroscopic particles by freezing of small droplets in the clouds.
    - As the flakes become bigger they become heavy enough to slowly fall down.
    - And that is exactly how snowflakes form and fall down.
    - These are the forms of precipitation for snowflakes.

- - For these precipitations to take place there are processes leading to precipitation or rainfall.
    - Requirements for precipitation: Small droplets, large condensation nuclei, temperature (above freezing: rain, below freezing: sleet, hail).
    - Normally large condensation nuclei, are present near earth's surface. And not in the upper troposphere.
    - This is why not everywhere we get precipitation happening always.
    - Precipitation takes place only when:
        - There are clouds - suspended water particles on small hygroscopic nuclei.
        - Large condensation nuclei reach those clouds.
    - Hence, the more important condition is how large condensation nuclei reach the cloud.
    - Hence the processes causing the large condensation nuclei to reach the cloud are rising air processes, which carry such particles with them.
    - Such as: 
        - Convectional rise of air (heated, thermal convectional rise).
        - Orographic (mountain) rise.
        - Cyclonic rise: Frontal cyclonic and tropical cyclonic rise.
    - Just clouds themselves cannot cause rain.

**Convectional Rise:**

- - Due to rising air in hot conditions gradually cloud formation and further precipitation might take place.
    - Also leading to cumulonimbus cloud formation. 

**Orographic Rise:** 

- - Rising winds over mountain slopes cause orographic precipitation.
    - This causes rains in the mountain.

Cyclonic precipitation will be explained while explaining cyclones. 

##### Major regions of precipitation in the world: 

- - Normally precipitation decreases as we go from the equator towards the pole.
    - It also decreases when we go from coastal regions to the interior of continents.
    - On continents, it decreases from east to west,  between 0 to 30-35 degrees latitude over the continents.(winds)
    - And in 35 to 65 degrees latitude, it decreases when we go from west to east.(winds)
    - Earth has been divided into major precipitation zones on the basis of amount of rainfall. Here it should be noted, that the global average precipitation is around 100 cm annually. 
    - In India it is 125 cm.

**Par Humid Regions: (more than 200 cm annually)**

- - Hence regions receiving more than 200 cm annually, are known as par humid regions.
    - This includes:
        - A: Equatorial Belt.
        - B: Coastal monsoon regions.
        - C: The windward slopes of mountains in westerlies wind regions.

**Humid Regions (100-200 cm annually):**

- - A: Continental coastal region.
    - B: Windward sides of interior continents.

**Semi-Arid Regions (50-100 cm annually):** 

- - A: Interior tropical regions.
    - B: Interior temperate regions
    - C: Western tropical and eastern temperate regions.

**Arid Regions (less than 50 cm annually).** 

- - A: Tropical Deserts (western sides of continents).
    - B: Rainshadow/Leeward side of mountains.
    - C: Polar regions.

##### Sunshine

- - The same factors which affect the insolation, affect the sunshine.
    - And hence, tropical regions have more sunshine, because they have mechanical high pressure (descending winds, hence clear skies). 
    - Equatorial regions have low-pressure and hence clouds, hence slightly lesser sunshine than tropical regions.
    - Further, as we go poleward, sunshine decreases in intensity, because it becomes inclined. 

##### Visibility

- - Visibility is affected both in dry and humid regions.
    - In dry regions (less than 75% RH), we generally get haze, which is dusty condition, too much of dust in the air, which reduces visibility to less than 2 km. such as sandy dust storms in deserts, which makes the air hazy.
    - In humid regions (about 95% RH), we get two kinds of low visibility conditions, such as mist and fog.
    - Mist and fog form similarly, and they are like clouds near the ground.
    - But mist has fewer and bigger droplets with visibility around 1000 metres.
    - Fog has numerous smaller droplets and visibility might be as less as few metres.
    - Fog is like dense clouds.

## Cyclone

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 44.png>)

**How winds move in cyclonic conditions:**

- - Cyclonic conditions develop over low-pressure conditions.
    - These are absolute low-pressure conditions.
    - Low-pressure conditions: Horizontal inward wind starts to blow.
    - Lower the low pressure, stronger and faster will be the winds.
    - If wind speed is below 31kmph, we call it low.
    - If the wind becomes 31km - 49 kmph, we start calling it depression.
    - If wind speed is 49 - 62 kmph, we call it as deep depression.
    - If the wind speed becomes 63 - 88 kmph, we start calling it as a cyclone.
    - Severe Cyclone: 89 -117 kmph (wind speed).
    - Very Severe Cyclone: 118-165 kmph (wind speed).
    - Extremely Severe Cyclone: 166-220 kmph (wind speed).
    - Super Severe Cyclone: more than 220 kmph (wind speed).

**For cyclones, the other conditions which need to be fulfilled are:**

- - A regional low-pressure condition.
    - When we see, in reality the high and low pressures on the earth, we find that certain regions have high pressure, and certain regions have low pressure. And as we go away around them, we find that circular or some non-uniform isobars formed around them.
    - And wind tend to flow from high to low-pressure regions.
    - Hence in reality, we get circular or near-circular isobars, hence for cyclones also, circular or near-circular isobars are needed.
    - The other conditions of cyclones are:
    - Inward spiralling winds horizontally, around the low-pressure centre, having required minimum speed, which moves vertically outwards.
    - The opposite condition of this with wind vertically inwards, and spiralling horizontally outwards slowly, around a high-pressure condition is called as anti-cyclonic conditions.
    - How does wind spiral around circular isobars?
    - For tropical cyclones, in the northern hemisphere, we find that the wind moves anti-clockwise spiralling inwards horizontally.
    - High-pressure anticyclone: Horizontally spiralling outward, clockwise.  

**WINDS FLOW IN CYCLONIC AND ANTI-CYCLONIC CONDITIONS**

- - Around low-pressure centres, with near-circular isobars, cyclonic conditions are created with horizontally inward spiralling winds, and around high-pressure centres, with circular isobars, anti-cyclonic conditions are created with horizontally outwards spiralling winds, over the whole earth.
    - Direction for spiralling in the two hemispheres(clockwise or anti-clockwise) is decided by the overall effect of Coriolis force as discussed below.

- - **Northern hemisphere condition-**
        - As we have seen in the diagram of northern hemisphere cyclonic winds due to low-pressure gradient force is radially inward hence initially winds try to move inwards. As the Coriolis in the northern hemisphere acts towards the right as inwards coming wind also try to bend towards the right, and because of pressure gradient force and Coriolis force the northern hemisphere winds around the low-pressure centre move anti-clockwise and circular
        - Due to the additional effect of frictional force acting opposite to Coriolis force and hence in the direction of Pressure Gradient Force, finally, the winds spiralling inwards towards the low-pressure centre
        - Hence, simply said finally we find that the wind due to PGF, Coriolis force and frictional force is spiralling inwards anti-clockwise around the low-pressure centre in the northern hemisphere.
        - In The Anti-cyclonic HP condition in Northern Hemisphere, the PGF is acting outward the wind also tries to go radially outward. The Coriolis force acting right to the wind finally acts opposite to the PGF and hence the wind starts moving circular around the High-pressure centre due to PGF and Coriolis force.
        - As the Frictional force acts opposite to the Coriolis force and hence in the direction of PGF so the wind starts finally spiralling outwards.
        - Hence, simply said through the PGF and Coriolis force and friction force finally the wind moves spiralling outwards around HP centre in the Northern hemisphere creating the anti-cyclonic condition.

- - **Southern Hemisphere condition-**
        - In the southern hemisphere due to the leftward direction of Coriolis force clockwise and anti-clockwise direction of cyclonic and anticyclonic condition in the southern hemisphere.
        - So simply said cyclonic winds in the southern hemisphere are clockwise and anti-cyclonic winds are anti-clockwise
        - These conditions prevail for the cyclonic and anticyclonic condition of the tropic, temperate or polar region.

##### PRIMARY UPPER ATMOSPHERIC WINDS

**GEO-STROPHIC WINDS**

- - Are generally created below the tropopause above 30 degree and 60 degrees latitude in general. But there are certain more conditions creating geostrophic winds which move west-east. These winds through moving nearly parallel to the latitude in the upper atmosphere but are not strictly parallel. As they move slightly wave-like shifting poleward and equatorward like away as they broadly move west to east.
    - These west to east geostrophic winds moving wave-like are called Rossby waves
    - Rossby waves are wide horizontally spreading over a few degrees latitude and thousand km wide and most of the wind in Rossby waves moving relatively slow

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 23.jpeg>)

**JET STREAM**

- - They are type of geostrophic wind, strongest where the pressure gradient is highest
    - Are generally formed within the Rossby waves and are horizontally narrower up to 100-150 km wide vertically 2-3 km depth but having high wind speeds of 100km/hr to more than 300 km/hr
    - Jet streams are formed below the tropopause between the primary atmospheric cells generally. But few jet streams are also formed elsewhere
    - Jet streams are formed due to High temperature and pressure gradient in the upper atmosphere. The major jet stream of importance to us are
        - Polar night jet stream-during night (which means winters) of poles and hence they are formed only for 6 months. The polar night jet stream plays a role in the formation of the polar vortex, polar stratospheric clouds. Move west to east.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 46.png>)
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 47.png>)

- - Polar frontal Jet Stream - also called a Polar jet stream. This is formed above 60-degree latitude between the polar cell or Ferrel cell below the tropopause over the polar front. With the shifting of sun and polar and Ferrel cells, this jet stream also shifts between 30-70 degree latitudes. They blow at a height of 9 to 12 km, are related to the polar front formation with wind speeds of 100-300km/hr. moving west to east.
    - The sub-Tropical westerly jet stream - formed over the subtropic HP belt and below the tropopause over the sub-tropical front. This jet stream also keeps shifting btw 20-35 degrees latitude with the shifting of the sun and the pressure belts. Subtropical westerly jet stream formed at a height of 10-14 km. moving at a speed of 300km/hr. Moving west to east. They also play a role in bringing temperate cyclones called western disturbances in India
    - The tropical easterly jet stream - is a seasonal jet stream blowing only during June-sept in the northern hemisphere over the Indian subcontinent and Indian ocean between 8 degrees to 30 degrees north latitude at a height of 14-16 km. The wind speeds are around 100 km/hr. The tropical easterly jet stream is responsible for the summer monsoon over India. They also play a role in bringing tropical depressions and tropical cyclones into India and hence causing rainfall.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 48.png>)

- - Somali Jet stream - important for Indian perspective. Moving in middle atmosphere from Somalian coast towards India pushing the south-west monsoon winds towards Indian and hence enhancing monsoon rains over India

**POLAR VERTEX**

- - During the polar night, polar night jet stream is formed just below the tropopause
    - Jet streams from the beginning of winters trap the upper atmospheric air within the jet streams
    - This trapped air becomes cold or extremely cold over the winter period and leads to the formation of extremely cold clouds which sometimes extend even above the tropopause into the stratosphere known as polar stratospheric clouds
    - These clouds play a role in ozone depletion and creating ozone holes over poles
    - Extremely cold air trapped btw the circling jet stream moves like a vortex in the upper atmosphere and technically this is the polar vortex.
    - As the winters end and the polar night jet stream weakens the polar vortex air which is extremely cold starts to descend to lower altitudes and spread to lower latitudes.
    - These are extremely cold storm like winds that are experienced in the subpolar region and high latitude temperate region by end of winters and this phenomenon is known as polar vortex during this period.

### TEMPERATE CYCLONES AND CONCEPTS

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 51.png>)

##### AIR MASSES AND FRONTS

- - Temperate cyclones are also known as an extratropical cyclone, frontal cyclone, mid-latitude cyclone
    - 40-60 degree cyclone.
    - Are formed over the front region (within the warm front and cold front)
    - such fronts are formed between air masses having contrasting temperature conditions (COLD AIRMASS AND WARM AIRMASS)

##### AIRMASS -

- - Airmass is a huge Parcel of air above the surface of earth and extending through the troposphere
    - It has a wide latitudinal extent spreading over 100km or 1000km.
    - One given airmass would generally have horizontally uniform pressure and temperature condition whereas vertically and throughout the airmass it would have humidity condition
    - Hence, simply said throughout the given air mass there is uniformity of temperature and pressure condition horizontally and also uniformity of humidity in general.
    - We will focus on Hot and cold air masses. Two Adjacent airmasses are called hot or cold on the basis of their relative temperatures.
    - It is also known that airmasses over oceans are relatively more humid and once over interior continents are relatively drier or less humid airmass.

**DIFFERENT MAJOR AIR MASSES**

- - On the basis of latitudes we have 3 airmass -

a)The Arctic and Antarctic airmass

b)Polar Airmass

c)Tropical Airmass

- - Accordingly, following types of airmasses are recognised:

Maritime tropical (mT)

Continental tropical (cT)

Maritime polar (mP)

Continental polar (cP)

Continental arctic (cA)

##### FRONT

- - A front is a narrow region separating one air mass from the other air mass. Hence, generally on the two sides of the front, the temperature, pressure and humidity condition will be different
    - A front is called the strong front if the air masses on the two sides have a very distinct character. For ex. one is much cold or the other is much warm
    - On the other hand, a front is called as the weak front if the two air masses on the two sides of the front have very similar kind of characteristics like both are having cold air mass or both are warm airmass
    - Hence, generally across a distinct front, the temperature and hence the pressure gradient is high
    - But it should also be noted that if the air masses are very distinct in terms of temperature and humidity then do not easily mix with each other

**CLASSIFICATION OF FRONT**

- - ON THE BASIS OF AIRMASS - STRONG FRONT (DISTINCT & CONTRASTING AIRMASS) AND WEAK (SIMILAR AIRMASS)
    - ON THE BASIS OF MOVEMENT OF AIRMASS - STATIONARY FRONT; WARM FRONT; COLD FRONT; OCCLUDED FRONT
    - As we see in the stationary front diagram - because the air masses do not push into each other hence the front between these airmasses does not move either poleward or equatorward and hence remains stationary. hence we called as a **stationary front.**
    - But we also know for example that between the polar cell and Ferrel cell in the upper atmosphere below the tropopause we have a polar front jet stream and we have seen that these jet streams move wave-like or Rossby waves making poleward /equatorward waves and some regions moving clockwise (HP) and other region moving anti-clockwise (LP)
    - Hence mechanically in the upper atmosphere polar front jet stream make HP and LP regions.
    - So, wherever we have HP in the upper atmosphere then we gave corresponding LP on the earth surface and vice-versa

**Warm and Cold Fronts:**

- - As seen in the figures for warm fronts and cold fronts, we find, that, when Jet Streams, like Polar front jet streams, are moving over the stationary polar fronts, between polar cell and Ferrell cell, below the tropopause, these Jet Streams, as they move wavelike, between North and South Sides, at some locations they create anti-clockwise movement, whereas at others they create clockwise movements. 
    - These upper atmospheric anti-clockwise and clockwise movements create upper atmosphere low pressure and high-pressure conditions respectively. 
    - And corresponding high pressure and low pressure on the surface of the earth.
    - Hence, wherein the upper atmosphere, where the polar jet stream creates anticyclonic conditions, on the surface of the earth, over the stationary front, creates cyclonic low-pressure conditions.
    - This leads to an anticlockwise wind movement around the low pressure. 
    - Due to this anticlockwise wind movement, on the eastern side of the stationary front, the warm air mass pushes the front towards the cold air mass, whereas, on the western side, of the stationary front, the cold airmass pushes the front towards the warm air mass.
    - Hence, warm and cold fronts are formed.
    - In respective figures we can see, how cold airmass if pushing the cold front into warm airmass, vertically.
    - A warm front cyclone is formed due to the rise of warmer winds when the warm front meets the cold air mass and rises.
    - Along a warm front, we have inward anticlockwise wind in the northern hemisphere. Further, we have seen that as the warm air mass pushes the colder airmass, hence it tends to rise along the warm front. 
    - Hence if the winds are strong, fast, and spiralling inward, with clouds and rains, then we call it as a temperate warm front cyclone.

- - As the cold air mass pushes into the warm airmass, around low pressure or due to the low pressure created along the front, we get spiralling inward winds.
    - As the cold front moves towards the warm air mass, shown in the cold front cyclone diagram, warm air accumulated along the cold front, being lighter, tends to rise. 
    - And hence form relatively vertical clouds like cumulonimbus clouds and precipitation.
    - Hence this way, we get strong spiralling inward winds, along with clouds and precipitation. 
    - And hence we call it the cold front cyclonic condition. Or simply cold front cyclone. 
    - Hence we have seen the formation of warm front cyclones as well as cold front cyclones. 
    - Temperate cyclones are formed in the mid-latitude region. (30 to 60 degrees), Their jet streams also move in the west to east direction.
    - And are also driven by the westerlies wind.
    - Temperate cyclones are always formed along fronts, they are formed along the polar fronts, which is between polar cell and Ferrell cell.
    - They are also formed along subtropical fronts, which is between Ferrell cell and Hadley cell, there it is driven by sub-tropical westerly winds.
    - Hence moving west to east.
    - They are formed over large areas and hence spread over thousand to two thousand kilometres. 
    - They originate or form over both land and sea.
    - And affect the weather condition in the mid-latitude. 
    - The wind velocity is less, around 30-60 km per hour, hence they are not destructive cyclones, rather they provide moisture to temperate region crops, and hence have a constructive role to play. They are also called a family of cyclones.
    - The beginning of the front formation, or when a stationary front is formed, is known as the frontogenesis.
    - And the beginning of the cyclone formation is known as cyclogenesis. 

**End of fronts, Frontolysis:**

- - When the warm front cyclones and the cold front cyclones are moving in a west to east direction, at that time, because, the cold air is denser, hence, it is able to push the warm air easily.
    - Hence, the cold front moves faster, at the same time, because, the warm air, being lighter cannot easily push the denser cold air, hence the warm front moves slower, gradually, therefore, the cold front is able to catch up with the warm front.
    - Or start overlapping. As the happens, we can see that near the earth’s surface, cold air mass accumulates on both sides of the overlapping fronts, hence, the front becomes weak, and gradually tends to end, known as the **occluded front.**
    - Which also leads to the end of front or Frontolysis. 
    - Occluded, dying front: No more distinct front, hence called as the occluded or dying front.
    - As the fronts end, the associated cold front cyclone and warm front cyclone also come to an end. 
    - And hence this way, the end of the cyclone takes place.

### Thermal Equator and ITCZ:

- - Zero-degree latitude is the geographical latitude of the earth.
    - We have another concept called ‘thermal equator’, as discussed.
    - Different longitudes on earth may have different maximum temperatures, when we connect all these places, using a line, it is known as ‘thermal equator’.
    - A thermal equator is a line connecting places having maximum temperature on the earth’s surface, during a day, week, month, or year.
    - The thermal equator is not the same as the geographical equator, and it normally lies between the tropics.
    - We generally get an equatorial low-pressure belt over the thermal equator, and as the day-to-day thermal equator keeps shifting, hence equatorial low-pressure belt also keeps shifting generally day to day.
    - At the equatorial low-pressure belt, the trade winds of the Northern and Southern hemispheres come and converge.
    - And because these locations of trade wind convergence, are generally within the tropics, hence we also call this zone of convergence of trade winds as Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
    - The ITCZ keeps shifting with the thermal equator, or with the sun, hence it normally remains in tropics, but over the Indian subcontinent, because the hottest places are not within the tropics, but slightly north of tropic, during Summer (June/July), hence, the ITCZ also shifts up to the northern end of northern plains.
    - During winter, they tend to move south, hence, ITCZ tends to move towards the Southern Hemisphere.
    - But even in January, the warmest temperatures in Southern Atlantic and Southern Eastern Pacific, are not in the southern hemisphere, but in the Northern Hemisphere. 
    - Mainly due to high continentality in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as the cold current effect along the western coast of South America, hence ITCZ does not shift to these regions round the year.

### Tropical Cyclones

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 56.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 57.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 58.png>)

- - Conditions for formation of tropical cyclones:
        - Not formed in Equatorial Regions (0-10 degrees N/S).
            - Coriolis Force is absent/weak near the equator.
        - Tropical cyclones are formed only over the oceans.
            - Because they pick heat by evaporating water from oceans.
    - They do not form over rivers or lakes, due to size requirements (they travel 600, 1200 km).
    - The temperature should be 27 degrees or more.
    - In the summer to the beginning of winter seasons, they are formed, because such ocean conditions are available.
    - At the end of summer, the temperature of the ocean is maximum. E.g. in the Indian context, maximum tropical cyclones occur during October-November and May and June.
    - They do not form in India during June, July (due to monsoon season).
    - They are getting the pre-existing low pressure by ITCZ. 
    - Due to the presence of additional low pressure over the warm ocean surface, due to Coriolis Force, they tend to spiral inwards and pick moisture from the ocean.
    - They also pick enough heat during evaporation.
    - But it is hot summer season, hence, the ocean surface water has enough heat, and hence it does not get cooled easily.
    - Hence simply said, for a few days, the ocean is able to continuously provide moisture and heat by evaporation.
    - As the wind spiral in and vertically out, condensation takes place leading to the formation of clouds, along the vertically spiralling winds. Hence it forms the cumulonimbus clouds along with the cylindrically rising winds.
    - In this process, heat is released to the surrounding region, and they become relatively warm, 
    - And hence, rising air does not cool, and hence continues to rise.
    - This causes more suction at the surface of the ocean, hence more winds move horizontally inward, picking more moisture from the ocean surface.
    - And hence carrying more heat. This way the low pressure keeps intensifying, the inward spiralling continues, and the rising air also continues, with more condensation and heat release in the upper parts, along with cloud formation and precipitation.
    - Hence, with strong low pressure and fast and strong spiralling winds, and rising winds causing vertical cumulonimbus clouds and associated heavy precipitation, cyclonic conditions develop.
    - And this is how tropical cyclones are initiated.
    - For tropical cyclone development, the vertical wind shear should be less.
    - This means, vertically at different levels, the wind speed and direction should not vary much.
    - Else the vertical structure of tropical cyclones does not develop well.
    - Also, in the upper atmosphere, divergent wind conditions should be there.
    - So that more and more winds can rise from below, strengthening the tropical cyclone.
    - Hence, for the development for tropical cyclones, a wide range of conditions need to be fulfilled simultaneously. Hence they do not form easily everywhere.

##### Different parts of the Tropical Cyclone:

- - The low-pressure centre is known as the eye of the cyclone.
    - The vertical surrounding region is known as the ‘eye-wall of the cyclone.
    - Normally eye of cyclones is a relatively calm and clear sky.
    - The eye is around 16 to 30km.
    - Eyewalls are around 30 to 60 km from the centre.
    - Outward spiral is also present in cyclones.
    - On the sides of the eyewall, we have some clouds called rainbands.
    - From rainband to rainband the width would be 600 km.
    - There might be some subsiding winds in the eye, however, it does not reach the bottom.
    - Because ITCZ does not reach South Atlantic and South-Eastern Pacific, hence tropical cyclones are not formed there.

##### Major Characteristics of Tropical Cyclones

- - Tropical cyclones are formed within tropical easterlies and hence they tend to move in an East to West direction.
    - The width of the tropical cyclone and the associated strong winds, and clouds, and precipitation, spreads over a region of around 600 to 1200 km.
    - Tropical cyclone continues to strengthen as long as it is located over the warm ocean region, while other required conditions are also fulfilled.
    - The wind speed of the spiralling winds can be as high as 250km/hr.
    - And the tropical cyclone might progress at a speed of 15 to 25 km/hr. moving with the trade wind, in the east to west direction.
    - Because the trade winds move towards the ITCZ, so as to converge, hence the tropical cyclone also moves towards the ITCZ.
    - And hence, it does not move towards the equator in general, but rather towards the tropics, where the ITCZ is located during the summer season.
    - When the tropical cyclones hit the land, the place where they hit the land is known as landfall.
    - The strength of the cyclone at the landfall is very high, or the highest as for the given cyclone.
    - And gradually as the cyclone proceeds overland because it is not able to pick more moisture and heat, hence a cyclone starts weakening over the land.
    - Hence generally landfall and further land movement weaken a cyclone, finally, it might end over land, by moving further landward.
    - But it would cause a lot of destruction on land by them.
    - Sometimes the cyclone is able to cross the land and again reach the ocean on the other side of the land.
    - If the conditions in the other ocean are also favourable for the cyclone, then the cyclone might further strengthen.
    - For example, practically, on the Southeast Asian and East Asian coast, a large number of tropical cyclones form, and as they cross Indo-China and Malaya Peninsula, they reach to the Bay of Bengal region, where sometimes they further strengthen.
    - Hence, some of the tropical cyclones of the North-Western Pacific do move over to the Bay of Bengal.
    - And similarly, fewer tropical cyclones of the Bay of Bengal might cross over to the Arabian Sea, by crossing the Indian Peninsula.
    - After landfall, if the cyclone tends to recurve back towards the ocean while moving to higher latitudes, it tends to strengthen and become a stronger cyclone.
    - Normally recurving makes the cyclone stronger.
    - Recurving might happen, if the low-pressure condition towards which the cyclone was moving along with remaining trade winds is relocated, like the relocation of the ITCZ.
    - Also if some strong low pressure is created over the ocean, it might cause recurving.
    - Tropical cyclones also lead to phenomena known as Storm Surge near the coastal regions of landfall.
    - Storm surges are created when due to the low pressure of tropical cyclones, the water is risen by a few meters in the coastal areas, and due to very strong winds, the waves generated near the coast might hit at high speed.
    - This causes a high level of destruction in coastal areas, making storm surge as the most devastating tropical cyclone phenomenon in the coastal region.

##### Naming of Cyclones:

- - Cyclone naming is done in Nine regions of the world.
    - Six regional specialized meteorological centres and five regional tropical warning centres, which give warning for cyclones.
    - Indian Meteorological Department is one of the six RSMCs to provide tropical cyclone and storm surge advisories to 13 member countries (including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Qatar, etc.). Along with naming the tropical cyclones of the Northern Indian Ocean region. Including the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
    - All these 13 countries, provide a list of 13 names each, making a total list of 169 names.
    - These names are local names as per these countries' cultures.
    - So that every cyclone can be given a specific name. 
    - And hence specific warnings can be generated for each cyclone.

##### Tropical cyclone from an Indian perspective:

- - Though in the North Indian Ocean region, only 7% of the world’s cyclone takes place but their impact is high and devastating, because the coastal regions have high density of population, especially coastal regions of Bay of Bengal.
    - In this region, there are two peaks, October to November having a maximum number of cyclones, as after this ocean tend to cool.
    - The second peak is May to June, 13 coastal states and union territories with their 85 districts are affected by tropical cyclones in India.
    - Four on eastern coast Andhra Pradesh, Pondicherry, Odisha, West Bengal.
    - And one state Gujarat on the western coast is highly vulnerable to these cyclones.
    - In India, Odisha gets the maximum number of tropical cyclones.

**Why more tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal than the Arabian Sea?**

- - On an average for every 1 tropical cyclone in the Arabian Sea, there are three tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, because:
        - One, the Bay of Bengal water is relatively warmer than that of the Arabian Sea.
        - Second, more freshwater addition in the Bay of Bengal, so less saline and more evaporation.
        - Third, some tropical cyclones of the North-western Pacific come to Bay of Bengal.
        - However, fewer tropical cyclones of the Bay of Bengal move on to the Arabian Sea.

**Why less tropical cyclones during the monsoon?**

- - More rain, oceans have high pressure and 
    - Colder water in ocean due to rains.

##### Recent understanding of Tropical Cyclones as per Sixth IPCC Report

- - As per this Sixth Report of IPCC, the following major understanding has been developed about Tropical Cyclones: 
    - Globally we will have more tropical cyclones.
    - We will get wetter and windier tropical cyclones.
    - Tropical cyclones will shift to higher latitudes and hence, even higher latitudes are getting warmer.
    - More explosive tropical cyclones because they are intensifying rapidly.
    - The movement of cyclones is generally slowing down.
    - Also, climate change is affecting different tropical cyclones by increasing their severity.
    - Another group of Indian scientists has recently supported this IPCC view that the intensity of cyclones is increasing in the Northern Indian Ocean region.
    - With respect to temperate cyclones, especially the sub-polar region, normally, the very rapid growth of cyclones takes place with the atmospheric pressure dropping at least 24 millibars per day.
    - Which creates explosive temperate cyclones in these regions, known as bomb cyclones, or bombogenesis.

**Different weather disturbances in terms of time and size:** 

- - When we see different weather disturbances taking place in the atmosphere, we find them to have different sizes and times. 
    - Major ones are mentioned below in terms of decreasing size and time: 
        - Wave type of creation in Upper Atmosphere (Rossby Waves and Jet Streams).
        - Temperate Frontal Cyclones : Cold Front Cyclones/ Warm Front Cyclones (May remain for a week or more, size is 2000 km or more).
        - Tropical Cyclone (Size is 600 to 1200 km, might remain for a few days or weeks).
        - Land Breeze, sea breeze, local warm winds, and cold winds.
        - Thunderstorms (a few hours to a few days).
            - They might stretch a few 10s of km to a few hundreds of km.
        - Tornadoes, water spurts, smaller thunderstorms, might be for a few minutes to a few hours, and size might be a few kilometres.
        - Finally, you might have a few turbulent Eddies.

### Thunderstorms

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 59.png>)

- - Thunderstorms are when we have dark clouds with somewhat strong winds generally, and very heavy rain, which continues for some time.
    - There are three stages of thunderstorms.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 60.png>)

- - Developing, mature and dissipating, stages.
    - Developing Stage: When there is heat convection or some mechanical rise of winds, causing cumulus cloud formation. Which might get some rain and lightning initially.
    - As this stage continues, the cumulus cloud gradually develops into high vertical cumulonimbus clouds. 
    - From the top of these cumulonimbus clouds, large raindrops start to fall down.
    - Which also drag the air with them downwards, creating vertical air downdrafts. 
    - Mature Stage: Where convection on one side and downdraft on the other side simultaneously occur.
    - This is when we receive heavy rainfall accompanied by lightning and thunder and sometimes strong wind also. 
    - This stage continues for a few minutes to maybe an hour, causing heavy rains, which we generally associate with thunderstorms. 
    - This also leads to the gradual cooling of the earth's surface, which is the most common cause of the initial convection in the developing stage.
    - Hence by the end of the mature stage, as the thunderstorm rains come to an end, the convection also comes to an end, which was causing the cumulonimbus clouds.
    - This is the beginning of the end of a thunderstorm, what we call a dissipating stage. 
    - Dissipating Stage: In this due to the downdraft due to heavy downward rains, with no further cumulonimbus cloud formation, the thunderstorm comes to an end. As the rains gradually end.

### Lightning and Thunder:

- - Normally lightning and thunder are associated with dense cloud formation, and thunderstorm or similar heavy rain phenomena.
    - Lighting is created when two clouds vertically one above the other rub against each other or within a vertical cloud like a cumulonimbus cloud, the upward moving small droplets cause friction, and accumulate charge, with respect to downward moving larger droplets.
    - When the air between these two charged layers does not allow the charges to flow from one region to the other, then there is no electric current.
    - But when the charges are high enough they tend to fuse, an electric current passes from one layer to other.
    - But because air is a poor conductor, hence it extremely heats up and burns with the temperature shooting up to 20,000 degrees Celsius.
    - This burning is what we see as the lightning.
    - Once the charges have fully moved across, the current comes to an end, so does the burning.
    - And hence the lightning also comes to an end.

**Thunder:** 

- - When the air burns suddenly due to the heavy current flowing through it, it expands suddenly creating a cracking noise.
    - The same is produced also when the current suddenly stops, and the air suddenly cools, again producing a cracking noise.

**Tornados**

- - Tornadoes occur in temperate regions.
    - They occur where warm air rises to form cumulonimbus clouds.
    - Hence normally tornadoes occur on the leading edge of cold fronts.
    - Along the cold front, as the warm air rises and causes cumulonimbus clouds, from the bottom of such cumulonimbus clouds a small trunk-like formation starts growing towards the surface of the earth.
    - Due to spiral upward wind, it further increases, speed increases, up to 350 km/hr., hence trunk-like formation occurs. 
    - Coriolis force is higher in higher latitudes; hence speeds are high.
    - Along the leading edge of a cold front, because of rising warm air and cumulonimbus cloud formation.
    - And also due to strong spiralling winds, over higher latitudes due to higher Coriolis force, normally from the bottom of the cumulonimbus clouds, long trunks start to grow downwards. 
    - And when the growing trunks touch the ground, we call them as tornadoes. 
    - The wind speeds in tornadoes might be as high as 350 km/hr, and hence they are very devastating though smaller in size, as they form over few meters to a few hundred meters on the ground, and hence much smaller than tropical cyclones.
    - When tornadoes move over water bodies, they tend to spin and throw away water, a phenomenon we call as water sprout.
    - Highest number of tornadoes take place in USA(13,00 tornadoes every year), and also Canada, also Europe, Australia, South America, South Africa, New Zealand, and parts of Japan, Korea, China.

**Dust Devils:**

- - Dust devils are strong dust winds, taking place in the drier parts, especially deserts and desert surrounding regions. 
    - Where whirlpools of dust are created due to localized low pressures, created during hotter days.

## Monsoon

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 61.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 24.jpeg>)

- - The word comes from the Persian word Mausam.
    - This term is used in the context of the season which comes over the Indian subcontinent, between the dry summer and the dry winter season.
    - This is a wet season, especially during the late summers, when the wind directions are generally from the ocean to the land, also known as summer monsoon. 
    - Which is different from the late monsoon season, also known as winter monsoon.
    - When the wind directions reverse, as compared to summer monsoon periods, and generally the winter monsoon is also relatively drier with some exceptions. 
    - Hence, simply said, the monsoon season is the season of wind direction reversal, between the two half parts of the season, where the first half the summer monsoon is relatively much wetter, whereas the latter half is relatively much drier.
    - At the end of the monsoon, winters start.
    - The monsoon season has been observed for a very long time, over the Indian subcontinent region, and has been explained differently based on our improving understanding about the phenomenon.
    - Presently as we understand monsoon, it is considered a very complex phenomenon, to the extent that even IMD is still researching to understand monsoon in its completeness. And carrying out many research projects to better predict monsoon.
    - And it is using a Multi-model ensemble (MME) to predict the monsoon, where it uses eight predictors or indicators from across the world to predict the monsoon.

**The eight predictors are:**

- - The temperature of land in Europe.
    - Equatorial Pacific water volume.
    - The Surface Temperature of water between North Pacific and North Atlantic.
    - Indian Ocean Surface Temperature.
    - East Asian Atmospheric Pressure.
    - El-Nino phenomenon between Australia and South America.
    - North Atlantic Sea Level Pressure.
    - Winds in Central Pacific.

- - These are used by the IMD, to better predict monsoon over the Indian Subcontinent, which is the classical/most ideal monsoon region in the world, though the phenomenon of monsoon extends to the Arabian Peninsula and Africa, Southeast Asia, Northern Australia, and parts of eastern Asia.
    - But still, the IMD predictions are not 100% correct, telling how complicated the phenomenon must be.
    - For our purpose, we will try to understand the different major aspects of phenomena affecting monsoon.
    - As it can be said, the overall monsoon phenomenon is broadly an outcome of different phenomena, all adding up together to give the final resultant monsoon.

### Various major aspects or factors affecting monsoon:

- - Like large-scale land and sea breeze. Role of local winds. 
    - Shifting of trade winds: Global surface winds.
    - Affected by ITCZ: Role of Pressure belts.
    - Affected by Jet Streams: Such as sub-tropical westerly jet stream, hence role of upper atmosphere winds.
    - Also affected by the tropical easterly jet: Hence the role of upper atmospheric winds.
    - Affected by the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau: Role of major land features.
    - Affected by Ocean-Atmosphere coupled phenomenon: Such as El-Nino, La-Nina, Indian Ocean Dipole, Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).
    - The role of other secondary winds.

##### Monsoon as Land and Sea Breeze:

- - The simplest explanation of monsoon.
    - It divides it into summer monsoon, and winter monsoon on the other side.
    - During summers, land is heated, has low pressure, hence wind blows from sea to land. They are like see breeze.
    - During winters, the ocean has low pressure, the wind blows from land to ocean. Like a land breeze.
    - Therefore, dry on land during winter. 
    - But as per this model, every time, we should have the summer season, we should also get very good monsoon rains, and hence hotter the summer period, better should be the monsoon rains.
    - But in reality, this is not observed. Because, many years during hot summers, despite of high temperature over land, we still do not get good summer monsoon rains.
    - This shows the limitations of this monsoon explanation using the local wind analogy. 
    - Hence shifting trade wind analogy was used, which does not directly depend on the land temperature for sea and land breeze.

##### Effect of shifting trade winds: 

- - In the summer period (of India), June-Sept, the pressure belt has shifted, the equatorial pressure belt has shifted northward, hence southern hemisphere trade wind will shift.
    - As per the shifting trade wind explanations, during the Indian subcontinent late summer, June to Sept, the equatorial low pressure belt is around Tropic of Cancer, hence, the trade winds also shift towards the tropic of cancer, hence, southern hemisphere south-easterly trade winds cross the equator, and due to rightward effect of Coriolis Force, in Northern Hemisphere, the south-easterly trade winds become the South-westerly winds of Northern hemisphere, also known as South Westerly or the Summer Monsoon winds.
    - These summer monsoon winds carry the moisture from the Indian Ocean to the Indian subcontinent causing rains. I.e. Indian Summer monsoon rains.

##### Winter Monsoon:

- - As per October-December, during the Indian winter season, the equatorial low-pressure belt is near the Tropic of Capricorn, hence the trade winds also try to converge.
    - Hence the north-eastern trade winds move over the Indian subcontinents as the North East Monsoon or the winter monsoon.
    - And, because it is moving from land to sea, it does not cause any rain during these Indian winter seasons.
    - After crossing the equator, these winds due to the change in direction of Coriolis force, become Northwest Trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere, also known as Australian North-West monsoon winds or the Australian Summer monsoon winds, because during these months it is summer in Australia.
    - And because the Northwest monsoon winds are moving from sea to land, in Northern Australia, they bring monsoon rains in Northern Australia.
    - In India, it is the dry winter season.
    - But there is a limitation of this also, that it does not explain summer monsoon rains North of Tropic of Cancer in the North Eastern States, Bihar, UP, Haryana, Punjab, and foothills of Himalayas.
    - This is where the ITCZ explanation comes into role.

##### Role of ITCZ:

- - In July month ITCZ crosses the Tropic of Cancer in the Indian Subcontinent.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 62.png>)

- - As per this explanation, the ITCZ during the Indian Summer season shifts up to the southern foothills of the Himalayas, because of ITCZ is the zone of convergence of trade winds, hence, as per the summer season diagram, the trade winds also shift up to the ITCZ. 
    - Hence, the South Easterly trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere, cross the equator, and due to the Coriolis Force in Northern Hemisphere, these trade winds bend towards the right, i.e. towards the east.
    - Hence, move like Southwest monsoon winds, also known as summer monsoon over India.
    - South West trade winds moving over the western North Indian Ocean pick moisture from this region, as cause the summer monsoon rain, over Indian Subcontinent, up to the Southern Foothills of Himalayas.
    - During the onset of winter in the Northern Hemisphere (October to December), the sun shifts towards the Tropic of Capricorn, hence the ITCZ also shifts towards the Tropic of Capricorn.
    - And hence over the northern parts of Australia.

**Challenge with ITCZ explanation:**

- - ITCZ's explanation does not explain the delay of the southwest monsoon of India, in reaching over the Indian subcontinent.
    - Or reaching over the Northern parts of India.
    - This is explained by the location of the subtropical westerly jet stream, as given below:
    - During the Northern Hemisphere winter, which is the Southern Hemisphere summer, the ITCZ is over the northern Australian region, which is the ‘tropic of Capricorn.
    - Hence, the North-East Trade winds of the Northern Hemisphere, move over Indian Subcontinent, as North-East monsoon or winter monsoon.
    - And hence is generally dry for most of India.
    - When these trade winds cross the equator, they move like North West Monsoon over Northern Australia.
    - And they cause rain over the Australian region.

**Role of the location of Sub-tropical Westerly Jet Streams:**

- - As per the diagram of sub-tropical westerly jets steams, during northern hemisphere winters, due to southward shifting of the pressure belts and hence, of the Hadley and Ferrel Cells 
    - Even the sub-tropical westerly jet shifts southwards.
    - Also, during winters the height of tropopause decreases in higher latitudes, hence the Subtropical Westerly Jet is even lowered vertically.
    - Because of these two effects, the Subtropical Westerly Jets is located along the Himalayas, moving West to East.
    - Hence these sub-tropical westerly jets are bifurcated into Northern and Southern parts respectively.
    - Hence, during the winter sub-tropical westerly jet is partly located South of the Himalayas, as shown.
    - This also implies that part of the Northern Hadley Cell is located South of the Himalayas.
    - During Northern Hemisphere summers, we expect the sun to shift northwards, hence the pressure belts to shift northwards, hence, the Hadley and Ferrel Cells to shift northwards.
    - And therefore finally, the subtropical westerly jets to shift northwards, and also, to higher altitudes.
    - Hence, the subtropical westerly jet is no more expected to be bifurcated by the Himalayas.
    - This way, when the subtropical westerly jet shifts fully northwards of the Himalayas, now, the ITCZ can shift up to the foothills of the Himalayas.
    - Hence, only when the ITCZ is able to reach up to the foothills of the Himalayas, then the Indian summer monsoon is experienced over the whole of the Indian subcontinent.
    - But during some years, it is seen that the region north of the Himalayas does not get enough warmed up, hence the pressure belts do not shift northwards as required.
    - And hence, the subtropical westerly jet also does not shift northward or higher in altitude.
    - Hence, a part of the subtropical westerly jet remains south of the Himalayas, and hence, the ITCZ is not able to reach up to the foothills of the Himalayas even during this part of summer.
    - And hence, the Southwest monsoon or the summer monsoon of India is also not able to move over the Indian subcontinent.
    - This way, the whole monsoon phenomenon is sometimes delayed over India, over northern parts of the subcontinent.
    - But still, the variability in monsoon is still not explained by all the above factors.
    - Variability means Some years we get good monsoon, whereas in some other years, we get average monsoon or poor monsoon.
    - This is not explained by any of the above factors and hence the role of the Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau, tropical easterly jets and an additional role of sub-tropical westerly jets comes into play, as explained below.
    - During the summers of the Northern Hemispheres, the subtropical westerly jet moves north of the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau.

**Role of Tibetan Plateau:**

- - Tibetan Plateau gets warmer than normal and hence the surface atmospheric pressure of Tibetan Plateau is low pressure, and hence upper atmosphere over Tibetan Plateau is high pressure.
    - This causes a clockwise circulation in the upper atmosphere.
    - This leads to the formation of tropical easterly jets, from the subtropical westerly jets.

**Tropical Easterly Jet:**

- - Tropical easterly jet formation and strengthening: 
        - It is a strong wind condition.
    - During summers, while the tropical easterly jet is moving over the Northern Indian ocean, 
    - Near the surface of the Indian Ocean, around the Arabian Sea region, there is relatively high pressure.
    - As seen in the diagram during summers due to the upper atmosphere conditions, the tropical easterly jet formation takes place. 
    - During summer, in the Arabian Sea, there is surface High Pressure with corresponding low pressure in the upper atmosphere.
    - This upper atmosphere low pressure is in the region where the tropical easterly jet stream is flowing.
    - Hence they are taken up by the upper atmosphere low pressure, and partly sent to the ocean surface high pressure as shown in the second diagram.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 25.jpeg>)

- - Hence the winds from the surface high pressure this way strengthen, therefore strengthening, the South West Monsoon.
    - Hence, simply said, the strength of the tropical easterly jet, affects the strength of the summer monsoon over India.
    - The strength of the tropical easterly jets is determined by the extent of heating of the Tibetan Plateau, as well as the position and strength of subtropical westerly jets.
    - All these factors play a role in the variability of the Indian Monsoon.

**Role of all these (Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau, Subtropical Westerly Jet) in winter season:**

- - No easterly jet is formed in winters.
    - During the winter season, the subtropical westerly jet is partly bifurcated by the Himalayas moving both North and South of the Himalayas, also the Tibetan Plateau surface is much colder with surface high pressure, and upper atmosphere low pressure, hence no easterly jet is formed due to anticlockwise upper atmosphere circulation.
    - Rather the winter monsoon conditions prevail as explained earlier, and hence the North-East monsoon winds blow over the Indian Subcontinent.
    - The role of El Nino, La Nina, etc. will be covered later.

**Role of Somali Jet Stream:**

- - Somali Jet Stream is a low-level jet stream and hence simply driving the southwest monsoon towards the Sothern, Hence intensifying the Indian Monsoon.

##### Branches of Indian Monsoon

- - The South West Monsoon is broadly divided over the Indian Subcontinent into the Arabian Sea Branch and the Bay of Bengal Branch.
    - And these sub-branches are further subdivided as explained below:

**Arabian Sea branch:**

- - The Arabian Sea branch picks the moisture from the Arabian Sea, part of it becomes the Western Ghat branch.
    - Western Ghat: As we see that the Western Ghat branch of the Arabian Sea sub-branch approaches the Western Ghats from Kerala (Cardamom Hills) up to Maharashtra, Gujarat region (South of Tapi river).
    - It causes orographic rise on the windward western side of the Western Ghats, making this region a par humid region of India (250-400 cm plus rainfall annually in this region).
    - On the leeward eastern side of Western Ghats, the rains gradually decline, making the interiors relatively up to semi-arid.
    - Central Highland, Vindhya, Satpura: The second branch of the Arabian Sea sub-branch enters North of Tapi up to East of Aravalli Hills. 
    - This branch moves up to the Chhota Nagpur Plateau region and brings some rain in all this region (North of Mumbai, moving over the Narmada and Tapi Valleys, up to Chota Nagpur region), where it contributes around 15 cm rainfall annually.
    - West of Aravalli: The third branch of the Arabian Sea sub-branch moves west of Aravalli's. And because of lack of orographic or other factors, it causes very less rain in this region.
    - And hence this region is a relatively arid region or desert region.

**Bay of Bengal sub-branch:**

- - The Bay of Bengal sub-branch is diverted by the Arakan Yoma and Pegu Yoma hills of the Myanmar region, towards the north and relatively North-west.
    - East of Meghalaya Plateau: Here the Bay of Bengal branch gets bifurcated into 3 sub-branches, which is east of Meghalaya Plateau, which moves between Paranuchal hills and Meghalaya Plateau on its west. 
    - Then this sub-branch continues to move westward over the Assam plains towards Bihar and UP region and up to Jammu and Kashmir, moving south of Himalayas.
    - Meghalaya Plateau branch: The second sub-branch of the Bay of Bengal sub-branch moves towards the Meghalaya Plateau, which is broadly made up of three hills: Garo, Khasi, and Jayantiya. 
    - Hence this sub-branch creates an orographic effect as well as a funnelling effect in these hills, making some of the rainiest places in these hills, like Mawsynram and Cherrapunji.
    - West Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa: The third sub-branch moves over parts of Bangladesh, West Bengal, Orissa, towards Jharkhand, Bihar, UP and gradually moves toward Jammu Kashmir, causing decreasing rain from east to west.
    - When all these branches meet with the western Aravalli Branch in Punjab Haryana, they cause relatively more rain over there, than the Rajasthan regions. 

##### Normal Dates For Onset of South West Monsoon

**Old Dates of arrival and departure of Monsoon:**

- - As per this, the summer monsoon was arriving as per the following dates: 
        - Andaman & Nicobar by 28th May
        - Kerala & Tamil Nadu by 1st June and the whole of the country up to Rajasthan and Punjab by 15th July.
    - The departure of the monsoon was as per following dates:
        - Punjab & Rajasthan's departure started on 1st September.
        - By 15th Oct. departed from the rest of the country except Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.
        - By 15th Dec. departed from all of the countries.

**In 2020, IMD revised some of the dates of arrival & departure as follows:**

- - The new dates of onset of the arrival of monsoon were:
        - A&N by 27 May
        - Kerala & Tamil Nadu by 1st June
        - But it covers whole of the country up to Rajasthan & Punjab one week earlier of the old normal that is 8th July.

**Further Revision by IMD are as follows:**

- - Started departure from Rajasthan, Punjab nearly 2 weeks later than the old normal date i.e. started from 17th September.
    - By 15th Oct. departed from the rest of the country except for 5 southern states Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and departed from the whole of the country 15th December.

**Precipitation received during Monsoon and other periods:**

- - India's average rainfall is around 125 cm rainfall per year, out of this nearly 75% of the total rainfall is received during the 3 months of summer monsoon mainly June, July, August.
    - Whereas during the remaining 9 months of the year we received only 25% of the annual rainfall.
    - This shows that precipitation in India is very Non-uniform. Apart from this even the rainfall distribution when seen in different regions varies differently.
    - For example; some of the dry desert regions of Rajasthan receives less rainfall annually in 15th cm whereas the wet places receive around 1170 CM.
    - In terms of duration of the rains also some regions have only 5 rainy days in a year in dry regions and some of the wet places 150 days in a year.

##### Ocean Atmospheric Coupled Phenomenon(OACP)

- - Ocean Atmospheric Coupled Phenomenon means that some condition created in the ocean is leading to resulting conditions over the atmosphere causing atmospheric phenomena of the weather & Climate.

**A simple understanding of most of the OACP is as follows:**

- - **South Pacific Ocean oscillation: Normal Day**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 63.png>)

- - As shown in the normal year diagram, cold Peruvian and Humboldt current moves from the Antarctic region towards the tropical equatorial region along the western South American coast.
    - The tropical trade winds moving from east to west carry cold water westwards and while moving over this long distance of westwards up to tropical eastern Australian coast, this water becomes warm water.
    - Hence, Tropical Eastern Australian coast warm water accumulates during a normal year.
    - On the tropical Western South American coast, because cold water is being removed westwards causing Surface-water deficiency hence rising of deep ocean cold water takes place bringing more cold water to the surface, this rising of cold water is known as upwelling the colder water to the coast.
    - Hence, simply said during a normal year, in the tropical regions, the Westerns South American coast as colder water getting removed westwards, whereas eastern Australian coast has warmer water accumulating.
    - Due to accumulated warmer water along the western side of the ocean, some water tries to flow back towards the eastern side.
    - Though the strong trade wind does not allow this in the tropical region in the doldrum weak winds equatorial region some water success to continuously flow from the western and eastern side of the ocean and this flow is known as the counter equatorial current which carries some of the accumulated water back eastwards during normal years.
    - In normal year due to the mixing of Peruvian current and upwelling water along with the Peruvian coast nutrient for fish is available and hence fishes are also available which during a normal year gives normal fish catch to the fishermen in the region.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 64.png>)

**The EL NINO Year:**

- - The El Nino Phenomena happens every 3-5 years during this period the coastal water temperature condition along with Australian and the South American coast interchange as compared to the normal year.
    - During the El Nino years, the accumulated water on the tropical Australian coast becomes voluminous enough in amount so as to oppose and overcome the trade wind effect and rather create a west to east water flow in the tropical region.
    - When this flow reaches the tropical western South American coast, the water is relatively warmer than at the Australian coast than mainly because of traveling in the warmer tropical region.
    - Also as the Australian coastal surface water is removed it does lead to some upwelling here also causing some pulling of the Australian coastal water. On the other hand, along the Peruvian coast both the upwelling as well as current water reaching the surface water and hence very less mixing very fewer nutrients and very less fish availability.
    - This phenomenon starts around NOV. DEC. and continues from nearly 3 months to next year May June.
    - Because the fish catch during Nov Dec. low during such years and also the coastal water is warmer than normal, hence the Latin speaking Christianity following people called it as the arrival of Christ child or the boy child.
    - Hence, it is called the EL Nino Phenomenon and such years are called El Nino Years.
    - Simply said, During El Nino's years starting from November, December till next year May June the Australian coast has relatively cooler water whereas the Peruvian coast has relatively warmer water.

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 65.png>)

- - **The La Nina year(Once Every 5-8 years):**
    - During La Nina year, the Peruvian current is stronger than normal bringing more colder water to the Peruvian coast.
    - Also, the trade winds are relatively stronger and hence carry more water towards the Australian Coast hence causing more upwelling and mixing and colder water on the Peruvian coast.
    - This is experienced by the coastal people during more fish catch and colder than normal coaster water and hence called as La Nina year on the arrival of girl child year.
    - Hence, Simply said, during the La Nina years we get stronger than normal Peruvian current colder water on the Peruvian coast and warmer water on the Australian coast.
    - Hence, it is like a stronger normal year.

**Atmospheric Phenomenon:**

- - **Southern Oscillation or ENSO Phenomenon :**
        - Simply said, ENSO and SO are near cyclic changes of pressure conditions between the Peruvian Coast and the Eastern Australian coast.
        - The pressure index is also known as Southern Index.
        - An index is the comparative value of any phenomenon observed over a given period.
        - E.g. Democracy India, Sensex, Ease of Doing Index.

- - Southern Oscillation Index: It is a measure of the difference between broadly the pressure conditions and the related outcomes between Tahiti in Central Southern Atlantic, representing the eastern oceanic phenomena, and on the other hand eastern coast of Australia representing the western side of Pacific.
    - SOI= P(E)-P(W)
    - Therefore,
        - If P(e) is higher, SOI is positive,
        - Else, if P(e) is lower then SOI is negative.
    - During a normal year, SOI will be positive (because Tahiti a colder place has more temperature and more pressure).
    - During El Nino year, SOI is negative.
    - During La Nina year, SOI is ‘high positive’.
    - Hence, in this way, SOI helps us in comparing the Normal years, El Nino years, and La Nina years in a numerical way.

**Walker Cell:**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 66.png>)

- - Walker Cell is a wind phenomenon along with its vertical components forming east-west wind cells.
        - A: Over the Tropical Southern Pacific region.
        - B: Tropical Southern Indian Ocean Region.

**Normal Year Walker Cell formation:** 

- - During Normal Years, starting from November December and continuing for nearly April May, the tropical Peruvian Coast has cold temperature and high pressure, whereas the eastern tropical Australian coast, has warm temperature and hence low pressure.
    - Hence, winds blow from High Pressure to low pressure, i.e. South America to Australia, and hence form normal year Pacific Walker Cell.
    - Due to low pressure in Australia, winds come to Australia from even tropical African side over the tropical Southern Indian Ocean forming the normal year Indian Ocean Walker circulation.
    - These winds continue to April, hence the normal year Walker Cells are formed.
    - As shown in the second diagram, the Indian winter monsoon, or the North-East Monsoon Part, moves over cold dry Indian land, toward the warm Indian ocean, and picks the heat and moisture from the Indian ocean, in the process of cooling the Indian ocean.
    - And moving in the Southern Hemisphere as the northwest Monsoon, which is the Australian Summer Monsoon.
    - Causing rains in Tropical Australia, these winds continue till almost March-April, and hence cool down the Indian Ocean region, by next year May June, Indian summer monsoon.
    - As we can see, this way the Indian winter monsoon and the summer monsoon, and the Australian monsoon are part of a monsoon cycle.
    - One part prepares and assists the other. 
    - As we can see in the diagram, the surface Indian Ocean Walker Cell wind assists the North West or Australian Monsoon, and this way, helps the normal monsoon cycle.
    - And hence helps in preparing for the Indian Summer monsoon.
    - Simply said, the Walker Cell of the normal year phenomenon of ENSO, helps in preparing the ocean and atmospheric conditions for the Indian Summer Monsoon.
    - Hence overall assist the global wind cycles.
    - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 67.png>)

**El Nino Years**

- - During El Nino Years, Australian Coast has relatively colder water, where whereas, the Peruvian Coast and Tahiti Coast, 
    - South American coast has warm water, hence up to Tahiti Coast it is warm water and low pressure.
    - Therefore in the western Pacific, winds blow from Australia to Tahiti, forming the El Nino year Walker Cell of Pacific.
    - Whereas from Tahiti to South America, weak winds blow as the Walker Cell winds oppose the trade winds.
    - Hence, only rising convections in Tahiti to South America region, causing clouds and rains here, during El Nino years.
    - Hence, simply said, the Walker Cell of Pacific of El Nino Year, forms only between Australia and Tahiti, and further opposes the Eastern South Pacific trade winds, hence opposing the Global primary wind system.
    - Therefore making global heat transfer inefficient.
    - Hence, adversely affecting the normal weather condition of different regions.
    - This means that normal year wet regions will become dry during El Nino, and vice versa.
    - In the IOR region, the Indian Ocean Walker cell winds move from Australia to Africa, hence opposing the Nov-December NW Australian monsoon, and hence weakening the Australian Monsoon.
    - As the Australian Monsoon winds are the extension of the Indian Winter monsoon, after picking heat and moisture from the Indian Ocean, hence the Indian Winter Monsoons might also be slightly affected.
    - Hence, the moisture and heat transfer from the Indian Ocean will be adversely affected.
    - Hence next year May-June, the Indian Ocean will remain relatively warmer, which is an adverse condition for the Indian Summer monsoon.
    - El Nino in this way adversely affects the Indian Monsoon conditions, and hence Indian Monsoon, which brings most of the monsoon rains to India.
    - Simply said: El Nino Year Walker Cell winds adversely affect the global primary and secondary winds.
    - And hence, also adversely affect Normal Year global weather and climate, including adversely affecting monsoons in India.
    - ENSO occurs in southern pacific ocean (common sense है यह मिस्टेक नहीं करना)

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 68.png>)

**La Nina Year Phenomenon:**

- - La Nina Year, being a stronger normal year, hence, the Walker Cell of Pacific is strengthened, hence global trade winds and primary wind cells are strengthened, over the Indian Ocean.
    - Indian ocean Walker Cell is also strengthened, hence, it strengthens the monsoon cycles, ultimately leading to a better than normal monsoon cycle, for both Australia and India over a period of a year.
    - Hence, simply said La Nina has a positive effect over the Indian Summer monsoon.
    - As per IMD, both monsoon and ENSO, are ocean-atmosphere coupled phenomena.
    - They generally have a broad relation between them, with El Nino years generally having adverse effects on summer monsoon in India.
    - La Nina generally has a positive effect on the Indian Summer monsoon.
    - And Normal Years: Not much affecting Indian Summer monsoons.
    - But IMD clarifies, that only slightly more than 40% chance of El Nino adversely affecting Indian Summer Monsoon. And around 35% chance of La Nina positively affecting Indian Summer monsoon rain.
    - Hence, simply said, every El Nino year, La Nina year does not necessarily affect summer monsoon rain.

**El Nino, La Nino, and Indian Agriculture:**

- - As per the data of Ministry of Finance, it said that for normal years, Indian agriculture has a growth rate of around 3.7%.
    - For El Nino years, the Indian agriculture growth rate is around - 2.1%.
    - For La Nina years, the Indian agriculture growth is around 8.4%.
    - But we have very few La Nina, few El Nino, and many Normal years.
    - For the overall average of all El Nino, La Nina, and Normal years, the Indian Agriculture growth rate as 3%.
    - This simply means that overall, the El Nino, La Nina cycle, or the Southern Pacific Oscillation has the net adverse effect on Indian Agriculture.

##### Indian Ocean Dipole

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 26.jpeg>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 27.jpeg>)

- - Indian Ocean Dipole in the tropical Indian Ocean region, where African Coast is western side, including India also.
    - Whereas the eastern side is the South East Asian region, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.
    - On an average, over a period of 30 years, four positive and four negative phases take place.
    - First, positive phase: Southeast Asian region, high pressure and hence dry. On the other hand, on the western side, African and Indian regions have low pressure and are wet.
    - And vice versa in the negative phase.
    - Positive and negative phases broadly take place alternatively.

**El Nino and La Nina Modoki Phenomena:**

- - They are the tropical northern Pacific phenomena where the Central Tropical Pacific behaves one way, and on the other hand, the Eastern and Western Tropical Pacific regions behave the other way.
    - The word ‘Modoki’ is a Japanese word, because in Northern Pacific, the phenomena is similar to El Nino and La Nina, hence called as “El Nino and La Nina Modoki”.
    - During the El Nino Modoki years, the central Pacific becomes warmer, low-pressure, and hence rainy, whereas, Eastern and Western Pacific become high-pressure and hence dry.
    - During La Nina Modoki years, vice versa happens.
    - The El Nino Modoki has a 3-5 years average, whereas La Nina Modoki has fewer occurrences than El Nino Modoki.
    - Modoki is also a 5-6 months phenomenon, starting from the summers of the region.

**Madden-Julian Oscillation**

- - This oscillation too, like other oscillations, has high pressure and low pressure.
    - But, unlike the other oscillations done earlier, Madden-Julian Oscillation is a continuously eastward shifting oscillation.
    - And hence it is not fixed to a region, but rather a shifting oscillation.
    - It has 2 phases over 2 regions simultaneously.
    - First: The low-pressure region, known as the enhanced convective phase causing good rains, whereas the high-pressure region is known as a suppressed convective phase and hence dry.
    - This oscillation takes place in the tropical region of the world, once formed it takes around 30 to 60 days to go around the world moving west to east.
    - Effect on India: 
        - Whenever India experiences the positive convective phase, for example, June 2015, and June 2018 which are generally dry months, peninsular India got more than average rain for the June month.
    - MJO can strengthen EL-Nino and can weaken La-Nina

# World Climatic Regions

**Major Elements useful in World Climatic Regions:** 

- - Range of Temperature.
    - Humidity and Precipitation 
    - Winds (Primary, Secondary or Tertiary winds) 
    - Sunshine available.
    - Vegetation is directly affected by humidity and temperature.

- - Five Groups on the basis of temperature:
        - 1st Group: Equatorial group,
        - 2nd Group: Tropical Group,
        - 3rd and 4th are temperate groups: further grouped into warm and cold temperate groups.
        - Lastly the Cold polar region (5th Group).

- - On the basis of sunshine world climatic regions are groped into the same five groups: 
        - 1. Equatorial: Having High Sunshine round the year.
        - 2. Tropical Region: Having Very High Sunshine during long warm seasons (nearly 9 months) and high sunshine during winter seasons.
        - 3. Warm Temperate Region: Having High sunshine during summers, and moderate sunshine during winters.
        - 4. Cool Temperate Group: Has moderate sunshine during summers and low sunshine during winters. 
        - 5. Polar Region: Has low sunshine round the year.

- - On the basis of humidity, the world climatic regions are divided into: 
        - A. The Continental Interior Climatic Regions (Regions 3, 6, and 9 in the diagram). Continentality is high in this region.
        - B. The Coastal Regions: Affected by Maritime Conditions. 
        - The coastal regions are further sub-divided into: 
        - The East Coast: (Regions 2, 7, and 10 in the diagram).
        - The West Coast: (Regions 4, 5, and 8 in the diagram).
        - This way, mainly due to the temperature, humidity, and precipitation, primary winds, trade winds/westerlies, etc., and sunshine, we have 11 distinct climatic regions in the world continents. (As shown in the diagram). 

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 69.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 70.png>)

**How major Climatic Factors Affect Vegetation:**

**Based on temperature:** 

- - Equatorial/Tropical vegetation (hot), e.g. Neem, Mango.
    - Temperate has Apple, etc.
    - Polar/Cold has: Conifer Trees

**Deciduous Trees:** 

- - **Climatic Factors:** 
        - Such trees will shed leaves in one season.
        - Such forests will shed leaves in one go, hence they are known as deciduous forests.
        - During autumn, the whole forest will shed the leaves.

**Biological Factors:**

- - They shed leaves during any part of the season.
    - Not all trees will shed together.
    - These are called as biological deciduous forests.
    - Biological deciduous forests are called as evergreen forests (no leave-less season, some plants will have leaves during any point in time).

**Evergreen Trees:** 

- - Temperate Evergreen Forests: They are smaller plants, also in polar and cool temperate regions, leave production is not easy, hence they do not shed the leaves.

**Moisture:**

- - In a major way, when the moisture availability is high round the year, also if the sunshine is available, then photosynthesis can happen round the year. 
    - And hence, a good amount of vegetation biomass will grow.
    - And hence the forest will be full of greens. 
    - And here, the trees will compete for sunshine for their growth.
    - As the moisture availability gradually decreases, the vegetation biomass produced decreases, and hence there will be lesser availability of trees and vegetation in the forest.
    - And hence the forests will not be very dense, with the lesser trees and lesser leaves.
    - If the moisture availability further decreases, then trees will gradually be replaced by scrubs, bushes, and grasses.
    - And hence we will get grasslands replacing the forests.
    - With the further decrease in moisture availability, even grasses might not grow, and a special type of dry region vegetation known as desert vegetation also known as xerophytic vegetation will occur, such as cactus.
    - Wetland is wetter than normal surroundings, such places have hydrophytes (water-based plants).
    - Halophytic vegetation: Salt tolerant plants.(mangroves)

##### Equatorial Region Climate:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 71.png>)

- - 10 degrees north/South we have the equatorial climate.
    - This includes South East Asia (ASEAN countries).
    - Similarly in Africa, western central Africa, Congo, etc. regions.
    - It is hot around the year, with very little variation during summer and winter.

- - **Temperature:**
        - Days are hot, and nights are also hot.
        - This is the region of Doldrums, with no fixed wind direction.
        - Rather in the island and coastal regions, land and sea breeze blow between day and night.
    - **Pressure:**
        - It is an equatorial low-pressure region, and hence cloudy and rainy around the year.
        - Mostly convectional rains are observed.
        - Hence during the morning, slightly low temperature, the equatorial region has generally clear skies.
        - By afternoon as temperature rises, convections lead to clouds and rains.
        - This is round a year phenomenon.
        - This is the reason that sunshine is not the highest at the equator.
    - Sunshine is high and intense.
    - Because the region has ample sunshine, high humidity, and moisture around the year, hence, plants can do photosynthesis round the year.
    - And hence plants grow around the year.
    - Hence equatorial vegetation grows in abundance in this region, and the only competition is rather for more and more sunshine.
    - Different varieties of vegetation in these regions coup up with this problem in different ways.
    - They generally have broad leaves, to collect more sunshine.
    - And size does not adversely affect in terms of water loss, because moisture is abundantly available.
    - Some trees grow very tall, so as to collect the sunlight on the top.
    - Some sunshine passes through such tall trees and hence intermediate layer of trees also grows.
    - As sunshine is intense and nearly perpendicular, hence some sunshine still passes through the intermediate layer, hence lower layers also grow, such as scrubs, wet scrubs, wet grasses.
    - Climbing vegetation also grows, on the trunks of the plants or trees.
    - Hence such forests are the densest vegetation forests, with the highest variety of vegetation, or highest vegetation biodiversity, such as the Forests in the South East Asian Islands, Congo Forests in Africa, Amazon forests in South America.
    - Such forests are evergreen forests made up of deciduous trees.
    - Only deciduous trees give fruit and flowers, these trees are flowering and fruit-bearing trees.
    - These forests are also called rainforests, as round the year rains support them.

##### Tropical Climatic Regions (2nd Region)

- - Tropical East Coast Climatic Region.
    - It is around 10 to 30 degrees.
    - This includes the Tropical Monsoon climate of India and Australia.

**Tropical Marine Climate:**

- - Tropical Marine regions have the trade winds blowing, and hence bring ample moisture during the long summer (nearly 9 months).
    - And slightly less moisture during the short winters (about 3 months).
    - This region will have a nearly good amount of moisture for nearly round the year, though not as much as the equatorial region.
    - Also, it will have very high sunshine through the long summers, and slightly more inclined sunshine during the winters.
    - The Subtropical High-Pressure belt does keep the moisture and precipitation slightly less.
    - Tropical Marine will include: South America, North American east coast, East Australia, East Africa
    - Vegetation: The Tropical Marine Region, especially near the coast, has the evergreen type of forest as one gradually moves toward the interior of the continent, the vegetation turns into wet deciduous forests also called (moist mixed deciduous).

**Tropical Monsoon Climate:**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 73.png>)

- - The tropical monsoon climate has similar temperature conditions as marine, though in interior continental parts it may be more intense heating and cooling during summer/winters.
    - But the most distinct feature is the short hot rainy season of 3 months preceded by the short hot dry summer.
    - And hence it has relatively 9 months of relative dryness.
    - The tropical monsoon is slightly drier than the tropical marine. (Tropical Marine is drier than Equatorial).
    - And within the tropical monsoon region, we have wetter, moderate, and drier regions.

**Vegetation:** 

- - As we move in the tropical monsoon region from the wettest monsoon parts having nearly evergreen forests, then as we proceed to lower rainfall regions we fine Tropical Wet Deciduous.
    - Tropical Evergreen Forest: In more than 200 cm rainfall.
    - Tropical Moist Deciduous: 100 to 150 cm.
    - Tropical Dry Deciduous: 100 to 70 cm.
    - Tropical Thorn Forests: Less than 70 cm rainfall.
    - As we move to dryer areas, the height of trees becomes less and less, also the size of leaves decreases.
    - Vegetation will become less.
    - In Thorn forests, leaves will turn into thorns.

##### Tropical Continental Interior (3rd Type)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 74.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 75.png>)

- - It has very hot long summers and short cold/cool winters.
    - The annual temperature range is more.
    - Pressure: Tropical high pressure, hence generally clear skies.
    - This region will have trade winds with lesser moisture, after passing over the east coast region.
    - Hence, relatively lesser rainfall, than tropical monsoon climate.
    - The relative humidity is less, overall lesser rainfall than tropical monsoon.
    - Trees cannot sustain much, hence we get tropical dry grasslands.
    - For which the Savanna Forests of Africa are well known.
    - Forests have much lesser trees.
    - Which are sparsely spread.
    - Such grasslands support a huge population of herbivores and hence carnivores.
    - Savanna Forest, in South Africa they are Bush Velds, Lanos, and Campos in South America.

##### West Coast Tropical Climatic Region (Fourth Type)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 76.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 2.gif>)

- - **Temperature:**
    - It has long very hot summer, winters are short and moderate.
    - Trade winds are dry, they don’t do precipitation.
    - No rains due to clear skies.
    - The tropical western coastal regions generally have cold ocean currents.
    - Bringing cold water to the coast.
    - Hence, even any Sea Breeze does not bring much moisture.
    - Therefore, this climatic region is very dry. 
    - Called Arid Regions, with rainfall less than 25 cm annually, and hence they are the tropical western coast deserts, in continents. 
    - **Vegetation:**
    - Here even grasses do not grow.
    - Due to the absence of moisture, and hence the xerophytic/desert vegetation grows here. Such as the cactus.
    - Characteristics of vegetation: 
    - Very long deep root to collect water.
    - Capacity to store water in trunk and branches.
    - Waxy surface to reduce water evaporation.
    - Thorny horns rather than leaves to avoid water evaporation.
    - Regions: Sahara Libyan, Nubian deserts in Africa, Namib, Kalahari, and Great Karu desert,
    - The Atacama in South America, Mohave in California, the Arabian, Thar, Iranian deserts, in Australia: Gibson, etc.

##### Warm Temperate Western Margins Climate Region:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 77.png>)

- - **Climatic Factors - Elements**
    - Temperature: Summer - long and hot to warm; Winters - short and colder 
    - Pressure: Sub-tropical High-Pressure Belts and clear skies 
    - Winds: Summer - tropical easterlies and winter - westerlies 
    - Is the region of shifting of pressure belts and global winds is observed.
    - Rainfall - More rains during winter; fewer rains during the summer
    - Mostly the rains/precipitation are from temperate cyclonic and overall less rainfall 
    - Presence of many types of local winds as this region is surrounded by a range of other climatic conditions - Westside is moist; east side dry; pole sides are very cold and equator side - very hot 
    - **Vegetation**:
    - Though on its tropical side, it has hot dry desert conditions this warm temperate region is relatively moderate temperature 
    - Hence nor very dry also due to some rains during winter as well as summer
    - Hence the vegetation is also relatively more moderated than tropical desert vegetation which means fewer trees, monsoon forests, capacity to store moisture in trunks, branches such as Corpwood, and generally broad trunk trees 
    - Small broad leaves start to appear again as compared to tropical deserts so as to collect more sunlight for photosynthesis
    - The trees along with leaves have a waxy leathery surface to reduce evaporation
    - Fruits also have a thick waxy surface along with storing a good amount of moisture such as citrus fruits like oranges, lemon, berry fruits including grapes, olive, etc
    - This is because the fruits processing industry is prominent in this region such as jam, wine, olive oil, etc which is generally consumed in this region  
    - Grasses generally do not grow much and hence animal production is less
    - This climate is also known as Mediterranean Climate - found along the region in Mediterranean region; also on western coats of USA i.e. the California region; western coast of South America i.e. Central Coastal Chile; Cape Town region in South Africa; Southern region of Australia

##### Warm Temperate Continental Interior:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 78.png>)

- - **Temperature**: The temperature range is high; short winters but very cold; long summers but decently hot 
    - Summer - tropical easterly with not too much moisture and winters - westerly with not too much moisture
    - Overall rainfall will be less in winter; mostly temperate cyclonic whereas in summer - both cyclonic as well as some conventional; hence overall precipitation will be relatively more in summer than winter
    -  This region will have lesser trees than the Mediterranean climate and summer rains will generally support the growth of grasses
    - This region will be a temperate grasslands region i.e. just poleward of tropical grasslands (Region 3 - Savanah Grasslands)
    - These grasslands are more nutritional as evaporation is less; very few trees  
    - In the temperate grasslands also, the region getting more rain will have taller grass whereas the regions getting fewer rains will have shorter grass 
    - Steppes Temperate Grasslands will have shorter grassland as compared to Prairies grasslands in North America
    - In Europe - Pustaz; China - Manchuria Grasslands; South America - Pampas; Africa - High Veld; Australia - Downs and Canterbury Grasslands

**Types of Grasses**:

- - Very Hot:
    - Wet - Equatorial; Tropical Marine and Wet Tropical Monsoon = Wet tropical grass regions = Rice and Sugarcane
    - Dry - Tropical Dry monsoon and Savannah Grasslands = Dry tropical grass = Dry coarse grains - Jowar, Bajra, Ragi

- - Warm and Cold:
    - Dry - the Mediterranean and Temperate Grasslands = Dry temperate grass (need some cold seasons also) - Wheat, Oats, Barley, Rye, etc 

##### Warm Temperate Eastern Margin:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 79.png>)

- - Regions = Nanking - China Type; North America - Gulf of Mexico; South Africa - Natal 
    - Highest continentality in Nanking in China; South Africa's Natal region will have maximum maritime region 
    - Pampero in South America and Sydney in Australia
    - During Summer - Tropical Easterlies in these regions bring moisture and rain as they are coming from east.
    - During Winter - Westerlies will blow above them; In China type because of coming from the continental interior will be dry and giving dry winters to China type 
    - In the South American Natal Region, the westerlies will have the least continentality effect and hence will carry more moisture eventually giving more wetter winters 
    - The other region such as the Gulf of Mexico, South America, and Australia/New Zealand regions will have moderate winter rains 
    - So, the Natal type is wetter round the year and hence have more maritime effect 
    - Whereas, China type will have wet summers but dry winters due to relatively more continentality effect
    - Vegetation:
    - Natal type - Denser and relatively evergreen
    - China type - Deciduous variety and less dense
    - They will have broad leave vegetation, etc

##### Warm Temperate High Continentality Leeward Side Rain Shadow Regions:

- - In this region, the interiors of the continent, especially on the leeward sides of the mountains, we get relatively very high continentality and hence very dry regions
    - These are the desert regions - temperate deserts of high continentality rather than tropical western margin deserts
    - Gobi Desert and Taklamakan Desert; Patagonia Desert in South America; Ladakh desert - as it is on the leeward side of Karakoram Mountains, etc 

##### Cold Temperate Western Margins Climatic Region:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 80.png>)

- - It falls within the ambit of the Polar front region
    - Temperature:
    - The western margin has a warm current on its coast 
    - During Summers, the westerlies move over the warm current and hence the summers will be relatively warmer - short summers with some rain
    - Winters will be moderated due to maritime and warm currents
    - Also, very strong fronts will be created between Polar Easterlies and Warmer Coastal Maritime Airmasses 
    - Hence we will get stronger and more frequent cyclonic conditions causing generally rains during early and late winters; snowfall during short mid winters 
    - Hence the warm current and related warm airmass has a major effect on climate and seasons giving four distinct seasons - warmer summers, milder autumn, short cold snowy winters and milder late winters i.e. spring
    - It is found in the British regions and hence called the British type climate; North-western Coastal America and Canada region; Southern Chile; Tasmanian Island and Southern New Zealand Islands

- - Vegetation:
    - The winter deciduous vegetation has evolved this way to protect itself from snow load over the short snow season and hence they shed the leaves in winter
    - So, in the British type climate, where we have a short snowfall season, we get winter deciduous vegetation which shed leaves during the winter season

##### Cold Temperate Continental Interior Regions:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 81.png>)

- - Extremely cold long winters and short warm summers due to high continentality
    - Precipitation will be less because of interior and snowy precipitation
    - Regions remain snow-covered for the major part of the year
    - Snow melts during short warm summers
    - Extremely cold winds like Blizzard blows here
    - Vegetation - Coniferous evergreen type of vegetation is grown here
        - Because the temperature remains below what is required to grow leaves.
    - These vegetation forests are called Taiga or Boreal Forests - found in the Siberian region of Eurasia/Lapland and in Northern Parts of Canada
    - Animals - Reindeer; very less biodiversity grows in these forests and hence very few types of trees
    - Mostly few varieties and hence called Pure Stand Forests exist here 
    - In Southern regions, we generally do not have such forests except for high altitude mountainous regions 
    - Such regions are called the Siberian Climatic Regions 
    - A special characteristic of coniferous trees are - such trees are softwood trees - also useful in the paper and pulp industry; synthetic fibres, etc (unlike Hardwood trees in tropical/hot regions)

##### Cold Temperate Eastern Margin Climatic Regions:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 82.png>)

- - It has a cold current on the coast due to which the region has relatively colder summers and very/extremely cold winters
    - Also, the coasts get frozen during winters and hence not easy to navigate with a lot of Fog on the coast 
    - This is pretty unlike the British type which remains navigable due to warm currents even during winters i.e. year-round navigability 
    - The European Coast warm currents keep even some ports in the Arctic Ocean navigable during winters such as the Port of Murmansk
    - Whereas, ports even around New York gets frozen during winters 
    - This cold temperate Eastern Margin Climate is broadly found around the Ekman Highlands of North America and North-Eastern Coastal Regions of China, Japan, Koreas, etc
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 28.jpeg>)

- - Hence, this climatic region is also known as the Laurentian type of climate
    - In the near coastal regions, some deciduous vegetation will be found but as one goes slightly interior into Laurentian climate then conifer vegetation starts 
    - We do not have a Laurentia climatic region in the southern hemisphere, because we do not have Eastern Coast Cold Current in a cold temperate region 

##### Polar/Arctic Climate:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 83.png>)

- - It has extremely cold long winters and short cold summers 
    - Almost all snowfall precipitation never generally fully melts and hence accumulate as ice 
    - This over a long period and mixes over polar oceans affecting the salinity of oceans 
    - Vegetation would generally be missing with some mosses and lichens growing and we might have some animals also like seals, penguins, etc 
    - This climatic region is found in Antarctic Continent in the Southern Hemisphere and the polar parts of Eurasia, Greenland, and North America 

# STRUCTURE OF THE OCEAN

- - The coastline of the country is the coastal land shape, whereas the baseline is the line connecting the outermost land points of the country, including the coastal islands, near the coast (not like Andaman & Nicobar, or Lakshadweep).
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 84.png>)
    - All the seawater between the coastline and the baseline is known as internal water, which is legally just like our land territory.
    - From the baseline, up to 12 nautical miles towards the ocean the region is known as the territorial waters of the country, and this is also considered legally the part of the country.
    - Another 12 nautical miles is called a contiguous zone.
    - Over the water, it is also considered as the region of the country.
    - But the difference between territorial water and the contiguous zone is that the national air space is considered only up to territorial water.
    - The air space over the contiguous zone is international air space.
    - The contiguous zone becomes the zone of giving warning to the incoming ships.
    - Beyond the contiguous zone, from the baseline up to 200 nautical miles, we have **Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).**
    - EEZ is the exclusive economic activity region such as fishing, mining, etc. of the country. Others can pass through such regions, and can have the right to peaceful passage.
    - Beyond the EEZ, the ocean surface region is known as the high sea, or open oceans, or international waters, and the seafloor is called the open ocean seafloor.
    - Generally, every country has the right of fishing in the international waters or move in the international waters.
    - The mining activity in the open ocean sea-bed can be done only with the permission of the International Seabed Authority, which is under the United Nations.
    - ISA was formed under the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Seas (UNCLOS).
    - If a country can geologically and scientifically prove that a country’s continental shelf extends even beyond nautical miles, then it can get exclusive mining rights only for an additional 150 nautical miles of the continental shelf.
    - This region will be known as the extended continental shelf of the country, where others can pass through and also fish. But mining activity will be done by the concerned country only.
    - Such geological proof is to be given to UNCLCS (United Nations Commission on the Limits of Continental Shelf), which is a body under the UNCLOS.
    - These classifications have become important also for laying international communication lines. And international pipelines in the ocean bed, which we cannot lay on the EEZ or continental shelf of a country without their permission.
    - In the continental margin regions, we generally get the resources, which have their source on the continents or formed during continent formation.

### MOVEMENT IN THE OCEANS AND THEIR CAUSES

- - Movements in oceans are mainly due to variation in temperature and salinity, which ultimately causes variations in _density_, and hence water having different densities tend to move differently.
    - For example, denser water tends to sink, whereas the lighter water tends to rise, and hence, they cause surface movements also.

##### Temperature variations in the ocean:

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 85.png>)

- - Temperature varies in the ocean both horizontally, as well as vertically.

**Horizontally:**

- - Factors for temperature variation horizontally over the ocean surface are:
    - Latitude: As we go to higher latitudes, temperature decreases of the ocean surface.
    - Continentality & Maritime effect: Southern hemisphere has fewer continents, hence less temperature severing effect, or continentality effect during summers and winters.
    - Whereas in the Northern Hemisphere, the oceans are surrounded by bigger continents, hence more severe effects during winters and summers.
    - So northern hemisphere oceans are warmer in summers and cooler in winters as compared to the southern hemisphere.
    - Continentality: Semi-enclosed seas or oceans like the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Baltic Sea, Caribbean Sea, etc. have more continentality effect due to proximity and being partially enclosed by land bodies.
    - Ocean Currents: Cold current can keep waters colder in warmer regions whereas warm currents tend can keep the water warmer in colder regions.
    - Melting of glaciers and icebergs in the ocean: They make the oceans cooler.
    - For example- it is easier for the Antarctic region melted ice and glaciers to mix in the southern oceans, as there are relatively more open.
    - Whereas the ice and glacier melt for the arctic region does not easily get into the Northern Ocean, due to being landlocked.
    - Winds blowing over the sea: Warm winds make it warmer, and cool winds make the ocean surface water cooler.
    - The surface region of an ocean is generally considered up to a depth of around 400 meters.
    - The average temperature of the surface of the sea is around 27 degrees Celsius.
    - The surface temperature is affected by land temperature, and by the weather and climate of the region.
    - Also, the sunlight which is generally found to penetrate up to the top 400 meters of the ocean water keeps the region be bright and warm.
    - This region is known as the photic zone of the ocean, or the zone of light in the ocean.
    - As we go deeper into the ocean, the temperature of the ocean in the absence of sunlight, heat, and the absence of weather, climate, and seasons affect starts to get colder.
    - It is generally up to the depth of a thousand meters from the surface of the ocean.
    - Beyond this, is the deep ocean region, up to an average depth of 4500 meters, and the average temperature of the deep ocean is around 3-5 degrees Celsius.
    - The photic zone temperature of the equatorial tropic region is around 23-30 degrees.
    - In the temperate photic region, this might be around 13-14 degrees, whereas the polar and sub-polar photic region might be around 0-5 degrees.
    - Hence, in the polar sub-polar regions, the temperature does not decrease fast from the photic to the deep ocean region.
    - And hence, the polar, sub-polar oceanic regions do not have thermocline regions having fast temperature decrease, rather it has a constant temperature region of around 3-4 degrees Celsius.
    - The deep ocean water which is colder is generally denser, and generally, the surface water is warmer and lighter.

##### SALINITY

- - It simply refers to the salt concentration in the water body.
    - Near the mouths of the river where fresh water and saline water meets, the water will be brackish.

**Factors affecting the salinity:**

- - Horizontal layer the surface of the ocean, the salinity might decrease by the addition of freshwater, and it might increase by the evaporation of fresh water.
    - In the high continentality oceanic regions, the evaporation is high for example - near the coastal regions of tropical deserts, and hence salinity is high.
    - Similarly in semi-enclosed oceans or seas, the salinity is high due to less mixing with the open ocean.
    - It also depends on where the rivers are bringing the water, and how they are mixing.

**Vertical salinity:**

- - Most of the salt added in the ocean takes place on the surface of the ocean, and also the freshwater addition or removal also takes place on the surface of the ocean.
    - In the deeper ocean, salinity variation factors are not present.
    - Hence, the Deepwater salinity generally remains constant, while upper ocean salinity remains low and variable.
    - Especially in the photic zone where there is much movement in the ocean.
    - Deep ocean salinity is constant and high.
    - Also, the low salinity water is the lighter water, and the high salinity water is denser.
    - The region of fast change of salinity is called a halocline.

##### Density:

- - If we consider the density of the ocean vertically, due to both temperature and salinity, we find that normally both due to temperature and salinity, the surface water is lighter, and the deep ocean water is denser.
    - Hence, the final picture of the ocean density is: the deep ocean water is denser, whereas the surface water is lighter.

### MOVEMENTS OF THE OCEAN SURFACE

- - Density variation in the ocean can cause ocean waters to move from one region to the other, as many times, surface salinity might increase, making the surface water locally sink in the region and hence causing the complete circulation.
    - Similarly, movements on the surface of the ocean can also happen due to local winds which can create waves, and global surface winds such as trade winds, etc. which can create surface currents in the ocean.
    - Similarly, the gravity of the sun and moon can cause tidal movements in the ocean.
    - The density-related movements are mostly the biggest movements in the ocean, known as Thermohaline circulations.
        - Local winds - Waves
        - Global winds - Currents
        - The gravity of sun and moon - Tides
    - Density - Thermohaline circulations
    - Deep ocean currents are also due to density variations and surface currents.

##### Waves:

- - They are generally created due to the surface winds pushing the water in one direction.
    - Wind blowing in the same direction causes piling up and causes high waves, whereas simultaneous action of gravity on the high parts causes low waves.
    - This is the reason for the waves.

##### Tides:

- - Tides are generally created due to:
    - The gravitational attraction of the sun and moon, which is the gravitational force created tide.
    - Rotation of the earth causes a counterbalancing bulge on the other side of the earth, with respect to the gravitational force created by the tide.
    - Same way as if we extend one of our arms, and try to rotate, our body is trying to balance itself, extending the other arm in the other direction.
    - It creates a gravitational bulge on water, shown in the first figure, whereas the centrifugal bulge takes place on the other side of the earth, due to the earth’s rotation.
    - Hence the earth gets two bulges on both its sides.
    - These two bulges are known as high tides.
    - Because the total water on the earth’s oceans is constant, when two high bulges are created on the earth's oceans, at the same time, two depressions are also created 90 degrees longitudinally with respect to the high tides, which are called low tides.
    - Hence, the total result is that we get two high tides and two low tides 90 degrees to each other over the 360-degree longitude of the earth.
    - Because the earth rotates fully within 24 hours, hence all the coastal regions generally get high tides and low tides within a day.
    - During high tide, the coastal water gradually rises by some height, and the water dips by some height during low tide.
    - Some coastal regions get one high tide and one low tide in a day, and they are said to get diurnal tides.
    - Whereas some coastal regions get two high tides and two low tides in a day uniformly distributed over time. They are said to get semi-diurnal tides.
    - And some locations which get semi-diurnal tides have different heights of high tides and different depressions of low tides in a day.
    - They are said to get mixed semi-diurnal tides.
    - Hence all the coastal regions of the world can be divided broadly into these three categories.
    - This is mainly due to the irregular shapes of the coast, and hence irregular bouncing of the tides from the coasts and mixing, as the earth continuously rotates.
    - High tides and low tides generally hit the coasts generally at nearly fixed times during the day, and are very predictable.

**NEAP TIDES AND SPRING TIDES**

- - The moon revolves around the earth in 27 days, or nearly a month, hence nearly every fortnight, the moon, earth, and sun are in the same line, and another fortnight later or earlier, the moon and the sun are at 90 degrees with respect to the earth.
    - When the earth, moon, and the sun are in a line, the gravitational force and centrifugal force due to sun, moon and earth’s rotation are also in a line, and hence the tidal bulge pair of the moon and the sun are also in the same line and hence they add up.
    - The result is bigger than normal tides on these days of the month.
    - So on the first and last days of the month, the high tides will be higher than normal, and the low tide will be lower than normal.
    - We call these two days spring tide days, which occur on the new moon day(the next day after the new moon), and on the fortnight later on the full moon day.

**Neap Tide:**

- - When the moon and sun are at 90 degrees to the earth; the first quarter and third quarter days, separated by a fortnight.
    - One first quarter and third quarter day, we see a half-moon in the sky.
    - The moon bee closer to the earth has a more gravitational effect on the earth, and hence, the moon’s tidal bulge and depression bulge are bigger
    - Because the sun is farther from the earth, hence its gravitational effect on the earth is lesser than that of the moon.
    - Hence, the tidal bulge and depression due to the sun are lesser.
    - We should also remember the tidal bulge and depression due to any of these are at 90 degrees longitudinally and alternatively to each other.
    - The tidal bulges due to the moon will be on the line of the moon and the earth, whereas the tidal depressions of the moon (low tide) will be at 90 degrees with the moon and the earth. It will be similar for the sun also.

- - It is a weaker high tide as well as, on the same day, a weaker low tide.
    - Because the low tides and the high tides occur simultaneously at a place, we get a resultant weaker low tide due to the moon.
    - At the same time, 90 degrees is longitudinally away on the earth, we will simultaneously get a bigger high tide of the moon and a lesser low tide of the sun, hence the resultant will be a weaker high tide due to the moon.
    - This way, in these days (first quarter and third quarter) we get weaker high tides and weaker low tides on the earth known as neap tides.
    - Hence, it can be said that every day the coastal locations get a high tide or low tides, depending on, whether they are diurnal or not, depending on whether it is the new moon or the full moon day of the earth.
    - All the coastal locations on that day will get spring tides, which are bigger than normal high tides and low tides.
    - And if it is the first quarter or third quarter day of the month (half-moon days) get neap tides, which are smaller than normal high tides and low tides.

**EFFECTS OF TIDES**

- - Tides play a major role in accumulating or removing sediments on the coast, along with the waves and the currents.
    - If more deposition is done on the coast than removal by tides, currents, and waves, we call such coasts are coasts of deposition.
    - Whereas if more erosion happens than deposition, we call them coasts of erosion.
    - Tides also create a partly submerged region on the coast on a daily basis, known as the intertidal region. Such regions have their own intertidal ecosystems.
    - Tides also give us tidal ports at the mouths of the river.
    - During high tides, the channel of the river becomes wider and bigger ships can move in like the Hooghly port at the mouth of the Ganga.
    - We also use tides for generating tidal energy which is a renewable source of energy.

##### Ocean Currents

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 87.png>)

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 88.png>)

- - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 89.png>)

- - Currents are long-distance, large, slow-moving unidirectional movement in the oceans, nearly round the year.
    - They are of two types: the surface zone currents found in the photic zone (up to 400 meters), and we also have deep ocean currents which are found in the deeper part of the ocean below the photic zone.
    - The main causes for the currents are:
        - Sun’s heating: causes variation in temperature and density.
        - Salinity: Causes variation in temperature and density.
        - Gravity: Making water sink from the surface, hence other surface region layer moves to that region where water has sunken.
        - Surface global winds
        - Coriolis force
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 90.png>)

**Ocean Surface Currents**

- - Different **causes** of ocean currents include -
        - The global surface winds also called the planetary winds
        - Density variation due to variation in temperature and salinity
        - The effect of gravity
        - The effect of Coriolis force.

- - **How currents are created?**
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 91.png>)

- - Explained with the help of a diagram.
        - Current number 1, flows from tropical east to tropical west and the cause is trade wind.
        - Current number 2, flows from equatorial west to equatorial east and the cause is doldrums (lack of strong trade wind to oppose it).
        - Current number 3, flows from tropical to temperate parallel to the east coast of the western continent. The cause is trade wind which pushes it to move along coasts.
        - Current number 4, flows from western warm temperate to eastern cool temperate, the cause is westerlies.
        - Current number 5, flows from the cool temperate west coast of the eastern continent to the tropical equatorial west coast of the eastern continent. Coriolis force creates this current.
        - Part of the current number 4 leads to the creation of number 5 due to Coriolis force as shown. The remaining part of 4 hits the cool temperate western coast of the eastern continent and partly goes towards 5, strengthening it, and partly goes towards pole creating current number 6.
        - Current number 6, flows from the cool temperate west coast of the eastern continent to the polar west coast of the eastern continent. It is created due to the collision of current number 4 along the coast leading to bifurcation.
        - Current number 7, flows from the polar region to parallel to the eastern coast of the western continent towards the temperate region. The cause is polar easterlies.
        - These are major round the year ocean surface currents in different hemispheres..
    - **Northern pacific currents -**
        - Current number 1 - Northern equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 - Kuroshio current 
        - Current number 4 - North Pacific Drift
        - Current number 5 - California current
        - Current number 6 - Alaska current
        - Current number 7 - Oyashio current
    - **Southern Pacific Ocean currents -**
        - Current number 1 - South equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 - Eastern Australian current
        - Current number 4 - West Wind Drift
        - Current number 5 - Humboldt current (Peruvian)
        - Current number 6 - there is no equivalent of current no. 6 in the south pacific as south America does not extend much towards the polar region.
        - Current number 7 - similarly, there is no equivalent of current no. 7 in the south pacific as Australia also does not extend much towards the polar region.
    - **Southern Atlantic Ocean currents -**
        - Current number 1 - South equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 -  Brazilian current
        - Current number 4 - West Wind Drift
        - Current number 5 - Benguela current
        - Current number 6 - Not present
        - Current number 7 - Falkland current
    - **Southern Indian ocean currents -**
        - Current number 1 - South equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 - Agulhas current
        - Current number 4 - West Wind Drift
        - Current number 5 - West Australian Current
        - Current number 6 - No equivalent current
        - Current number 7 - No equivalent current
    - In the **North Atlantic Ocean**, because the coastline of this ocean is highly irregular and broken, hence, identifying the current as per our rule becomes slightly difficult. Hence, the different currents in North Atlantic as per our rule are -
        - Current number 1 - North equatorial current
        - Current number 2 - Equatorial counter current
        - Current number 3 - Gulf stream and Florida current (Gulf stream is named after the Gulf of Mexico)
        - Current number 4 - Northern part of Gulf stream and Northern Atlantic Drift
        - Current number 5 - Canaries current
        - Current number 6 - Northern part of North Atlantic Drift and Norwegian current (formed by bifurcation at British island)
        - Current number 7 - two currents - Erminger current and Labrador current.

**Implications of Ocean currents**

- - The currents affect the temperature and precipitation of different regions and hence, make a region cold/warm or wet/dry. I.e. current number 7 keeps the coast very cold like the Laurentian type of climate. Current number 6 keeps the coast warm like the British type of climate. Current number 5 (cold) keeps the western tropical coast region dry and desert type (tropical deserts). And current number 3 keeps tropical coasts wet and warm like the tropical marine climate.
    - Here, it should be noted that any current moving within the equatorial tropical region like current numbers 1&2 or moving from low latitude to high latitude like current numbers 3,4 & 6 are called warm currents. Whereas, currents moving from high latitude to low latitude like 5&7 are called cold currents.
    - When warm and cold currents meet and mix like 3 and 7 meeting along the east coast, they raise nutrients from the continental shelf and make fish available, hence, making it a good fishing coast, generally called as fishing banks, good for commercial fishing.
    - The whole circulation of the currents in the ocean is known as oceanic gyres, which are large horizontal circular motions on surfaces. Many times gyres trap material within them not allowing them to move outside the gyre as they keep floating on the ocean surface. The best example of such trapped material is the Sargasso Sea.

**Thermohaline circulation**

- - The thermohaline circulation is the circulation created in the ocean mainly due to the variation in temperature and salinity and hence, their related outcome i.e. the variation in density.
    - Hence, due to density variation in the ocean the denser water sinks to the bottom, and this way a large circulation is initiated in the ocean, involving the surface region, the deep ocean region as well as the vertical regions of the ocean.
    - The circulation so created in the global ocean starts mainly due to the freezing of the surface water in the polar North Atlantic region, where, surface water tends to freeze and the salt part is slightly released to the slightly sub-surface region which makes the sub-surface water denser and hence it sinks to the deep ocean.
    - In the deep ocean, this water moves from North Atlantic to the South Atlantic, and simultaneously on the surface water moves from the South Atlantic to the North Atlantic to compensate for the sunken water.
    - This way a global circulation is started, where, the South Atlantic deep ocean cold water further continues to the deep ocean regions of the Northern Indian Ocean and Northern Pacific Ocean. 
    - These waters upwell due to continental barriers in North Indian Ocean and North Pacific and simultaneously the warm surface water of North Indian Ocean and North Pacific continue to flow gradually, finally towards North Atlantic as shown.
        - ![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 92.png>)

- - This way the whole thermohaline circulation is completed.
    - Another subpart of the thermohaline circulation is a partial circulation between the Arctic and the Antarctic region covering the whole Atlantic only known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Which is the thermohaline circulation of the Atlantic Ocean.
    - These thermohaline circulations as discussed above, have large-scale implications on the global climate and seasons, and also they affect the various ecosystems of marine and coastal ecosystems. 
    - The way Headly, Ferrel, and Polar cells play a major role in heat transfer in the atmosphere, similarly, the thermohaline circulation is the largest circulation in the ocean, having the largest implication in heat transfer in the oceans.
    - Thermohaline circulation takes around 1000 years to complete one full circulation in the global oceans, hence these are slow circulation. Which will have long-term implications on the global climate like climate change if these circulations are adversely affected.

### Corals and Reef related formations

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 93.png>)

- - Coral reefs are generally a widespread formation over the continental shelf comprising of multiple coloured things as we generally know them.
    - When we look closely, we find that coral reefs have a living and a non-living part to them.
    - The living part includes the polyps (coral polyps), and zooxanthellae(algae) if they are found.
    - Whereas some polyps form calcium compound deposits called the reef which are hard stone-like structures or platforms on which the reef-forming polyps live.
    - Polyps are simple animals that are tube-like structures, generally transparent or translucent and they are **sessile**, which means, they remain fixed to a surface for their lifetime like plants.
    - The polyps can further be of two types - the **Hermatypic** (calcium carbonate deposit forming reefs aka hard corals) and the **Ahermatypic** (non-reef-forming polyps aka Soft corals).

**Hermatypic Corals**

- - Build calcium coral deposits (Reefs) throughout life.
    - They live in huge groups, their collective formations are called coral reef colonies.
    - Every generation builds its own reef layer as older layers go on eroding.
    - Because they need calcium compounds for building reefs, hence, they can live in saline water only. Not in freshwater, not in even brackish water (less saline i.e. at the mouth of a river).
    - They do not make their own food and hence depend for their food on another organism called zooxanthellae, which is a photosynthesizing algae. This means zooxanthellae can make food in the presence of sunlight and can provide food to hermatypic corals.
    - Hence, these algae live inside the bodies of the polyps themselves.
    - These zooxanthellae look like the coloured things inside corals, making corals colourful.
    - Because now the polyps have to ensure that they live in the photic zone for the sunlight for the zooxanthellae and also they need a platform to grow on in ocean waters, hence, hermatypic corals mostly grow on the continental shelf and submerged photic regions of islands. Also, they have to ensure sunlight round the year, for food, hence, they live in tropical regions only.
    - In these regions, the water is generally warm more than 20 deg. Hence, they have evolved into warm water coral and cannot survive in cold water regions.
    - Hence, because generally, the tropical western coast of the continent has cold waters due to cold current, the coral reefs are not found on the tropical western coast generally. But there are exceptions like the Indian western coast. Because the western coast of India does not get any cold current, hence coral reefs are found even on the western coast of India.
    - Because they need sunlight regularly, they cannot survive in unclear water as the suspended particles will block the sunlight. Hence, corals grow only in clear water and not in muddy/polluted water.
    - Some of the big and more populated warm water coral regions include - the Australian Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Triangle of Southeast Asia including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea.
    - In India, the coral reefs are found mainly in five regions - Andaman & Nicobar, Gulf of Munnar, Lakshadweep, Malvan, and Gulf of Kutch in Gujarat.

- - **Reef Formations**

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 94.png>)

- - There are mainly three types of reef formations -
        - The Fringing reef
        - The Barrier reef
        - The Atoll reef

![Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Physical Geography - भौतिक भूगोल 95.png>)

- - Fringing reefs generally grow near the coastal region around the continents or islands on the submerged coastal regions. Generally, reefs start growing this way.
    - Over a period, as the water between the fringing reef and the coast gets polluted and gets less suitable for polyps to grow due to lack of mixing with the open ocean because now the reefs act as a hindrance, the newer polyps tend to grow on the outward side (seaward side) hence, the reefs start growing farther from the fringing reef, many times up to 100s of times away from the continental shelves. These are known as barrier reefs like the Great barrier reef of Australia. 
    - Over a period, it might happen that the island around which they started growing might submerge due to tectonic activity whereas the polyps continue to grow in the photic zone and marine deposits or erosional material might be deposited over these reefs, making them into some kind of islands themselves. These are known as Atoll islands e.g. atoll islands of Lakshadweep and Maldives.

**Coral Bleaching**

- - Bleaching simply means becoming colourless. This happens when the zooxanthellae separate from the polyps. 
    - This separation happens under environmental stress of the surrounding in which the corals are living and shows the discomfort of the corals to this changing environment.
    - These changes include undesired changes in temperature (very cold/warm), salinity (less/high), too much pollution of water, too much turbulence due to tourism/transport.
    - If such environmental stress becomes too much, initially the corals bleach and finally they might die as a colony, degrading the whole coral ecosystem which is not good for the marine ecosystem. Because coral reefs are the most biodiversity-rich ecosystems in the oceans supporting a huge variety of other marine plants and animals. And because of this support, they are compared with and also called the rainforests of the oceans as rainforests on land also support huge biodiversity.

**Ahermatypic Corals**

- - These are polyps that do not excrete or release calcium carbonate deposits and hence do not build reefs or coral reef formations made up of calcium carbonate. 
    - Rather, they stick themselves to the floors of the ocean, and from these floors, they directly collect their food from the passing water which is generally rich in nutrients.
    - This also means that these corals do not depend on zooxanthellae for food and hence, don’t have to live in the photic zone. Therefore, they survive on the deep ocean floors. Which are the dark cold regions of the ocean. Hence, Ahermatypic corals are also called **cold-water corals**.
    - And because they don’t form hard calcium carbonate deposits, also called **soft corals**.
    - More than 4200 species of soft corals have been found in different regions such as deep coastal regions in Antarctica, Australia, Canada, Norway, New Zealand, the US, and the UK.
    - These are also found in the relatively tropical zones but in the deep cold oceans e.g. in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal region cold-water corals are found along with the hermatypic, reef-building corals.
    - The ahermatypic corals found in these Indian Ocean regions include - Black coral, organ pipe coral, fire corals, 
    - They can also be found in shallow waters as well.

**Dead Zones**

- - Also called hypoxia zones
    - It could be natural or man-made.
    - Natural dead zones e.g. Lower region of the Black Sea. Because water does not mix properly in that region and hence oxygen from the atmosphere could not be carried to the lower parts. So animals and plants are not able to survive in these zones.
    - Natural Eutrophication - because of which oxygen does not mix well in lower parts and the mixed oxygen in the water is consumed creating a dead zone.
    - Human activity - Agriculture waste such as nitrogen and phosphorus-rich chemicals into the oceans can cause hypoxia via eutrophication. Industrial waste can also cause this e.g. large dead zones have been created in the Gulf of Mexico region due to human-induced waste being released. Similarly, the Baltic Sea also has dead zones. There are around 415 dead zones across the globe in oceans. Also, large dead zones have been found in the Arabian sea along the Indian coastline due to chemical release.
