    - The member sends the bill to the custody of the House, and it is published in the Gazette of India.

    - The privilege committee of Lok Sabha has 15 members, and the privileges committee of Rajya Sabha has 10 members.
    - These committees examine the accusations and recommend appropriate action.

**CHALLENGES AND WAY FORWARD**

- - There is an imperative to codify what constitutes privilege.
    - The freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1)(a), vis-à-vis the immunity granted in article 105.
    - Any form of absolute immunity from a court of law, for example - violence in the house, etc. is against the spirit of rule of law.

**BUDGET**

- - Introduction: The term budget is nowhere mentioned in the constitution, which uses the term “Annual Financial Statement”, (Article 112).
    - The budget is mainly a prospective document with retrospective data also.
    - Economic Survey comes just before the budget and primarily focuses on retrospective analysis and future suggestions, or insights.

**CHRONOLOGY OF BUDGET**

- - Presentation of the budget by Finance Minister.
    - General discussion.
    - Scrutiny of the demands by Department Related Standing Committees.
    - Voting of demands in Lok Sabha, and they become grants.
    - Passing of Appropriation Bill.
    - Passing of Finance Bill.

**Lok Sabha has more financial powers because**

- - In a parliamentary democracy, the executive is accountable to the Lok Sabha, and may not have a majority in Rajya Sabha.
    - Therefore, the financial powers have largely been bestowed upon only the Lok Sabha.
    - The two principal legislations in any budget are: Appropriation Act- withdrawal of money, and Finance Act- Taxation proposals.
    - If any of them get delayed in Lok Sabha beyond the start of the financial year, the government cannot withdraw or deliver any money in the Consolidated Fund Of India.
        - Normally, both finance and appropriation acts are certified as money bills.

**Money Bill (Article 110):**

- - It can only be introduced in Lok Sabha and not in Rajya Sabha.
    - It can only be introduced on the prior recommendation of the President.
    - As per Article 109, The Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject the bill, but can only suggest changes, which may or may not be acceptable to Lok Sabha.
    - Rajya Sabha can delay the bill for a maximum of 14 days.
    - The President can either accept or reject the bill, but cannot ask the house to reconsider the bill.

**Financial Bill 1:**

- - As per Article 117. it is a bill that contains not only any or all the provisions of article 110 but also other general legislations.
    - It can be introduced only in Lok Sabha, and on the prior recommendation of the President.
    - Rajya Sabha can reject this, or amend this.
    - A joint session can be called for the bill.

**Financial Bill 2:**

- - As per Article 117, the bill deals with expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI), which is not related to matters mentioned in article 110.
    - It can be introduced in either house of parliament, and the recommendation of the president is required at the consideration stage, or after the introduction of the bill at the second reading.
    - Joint Sitting can be called for the bill.

**VOTE ON ACCOUNT**

- - The budget is a very important document that establishes the executive’s financial accountability towards the parliament.
    - The budget used to be presented on the last working day of February but from 2017, it has been preponed to the first day of February.
    - This is to ensure that both appropriation and finance bills are passed before the start of the new financial year.
    - Vote on Account is the provision through which approximately two months expenditure (one-sixth of the budget) is approved till the time the budget process is completed.
    - This led to smooth withdrawal in the new financial year.

**INTERIM BUDGET**

- - Any caretaker/outgoing government/government facing general elections present an interim budget in the election year.
    - It has both taxation and withdrawal proposals, but major policy decisions are not taken and are left to the newly elected government to decide.
    - While the vote on account only has withdrawal proposals, the interim budget has both withdrawal and taxation proposals.

**ARTICLE 112 ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT**

- - The term budget is not used in the constitution, but the term Annual Financial Statement is used.
    - It shall be the duty of the President in respect of every financial year, lay before the houses of the parliament an Annual Financial Statement.

**CUT MOTIONS**

- - Economy cut: This is with respect to a lump sum reduction demanded to be reduced from the proposed expenditure.
    - Token cut: It is a symbolic gesture of disapproval where the demand is reduced by rupees hundred.
    - Policy cut: Demand is reduced to rupees one, and an alternate policy can be suggested.
        - These motions do not get passed in Lok Sabha because the government has a majority in Lok Sabha.
        - Otherwise, their passage would lead to “want of confidence by the Council of Ministers again.

**Parliamentary Committees**

- - A parliamentary committee is one that is either appointed or elected by the house or nominated by the speaker or chairman.
    - It works under the overall direction of the speaker/chairman.
    - It presents its report to the house or speaker/chairman.
    - The secretarial assistance is provided by Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha secretariat.

- - **Why Parliamentary Committee?**
        - The prime task of the legislature is to make laws and due to paucity/lack of time detailed scrutiny of the bill does not happen. 
        - These parliamentary committees provide avenues for detailed scrutiny and analysis of the proposed legislation.
        - These parliamentary Committees provide for calm and considerate debate away from the public gaze.
        - Any proposed legislation becomes rich by expert opinion who can be invited to these parliamentary committees.
        - The executive’s fiscal accountability towards parliament is better ensured through detailed scrutiny of demands in DRSCs (Department-related standing committees), financial committees.

- - **Types of Parliamentary Committees**

- - There are 28 states in India out of which at present (2021) 22 states have unicameral legislature having state legislature only. While **6 states have bicameral legislatures**. (Bihar, UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana).
    - The minimum number of seats in Councils is between 60 to 500. The precise number is given in the Representation of People Act 1950.
    - Some states have been permitted to have a smaller size as per special provision in Art 371 e.g. 371-I - for Goa minimum number is 30.
    - Through 104th constitutional amendment act, the provision for nomination of Anglo-Indians in Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly has not been extended for another 10 years. Hence, it cease to be in effect after 2020.

- - **State Legislative Council**
        - At present 6 states have bicameral legislature and rest have unicameral legislature.
        - The maximum strength of state legislative council can be 1/3rd of the assembly. The minimum strength should be 40. 
        - State L council can be created or abolished by an act of parliament through an ordinary piece of legislation passed by simple majority.
        - The parliament can undertake such task if the state legislative assembly passes a resolution by special majority i.e. majority of the total membership of the legislative assembly and 2/3rd members present and voting supporting the resolution.

        - The remaining 1/6th members are nominated by the governor “who have special knowledge or practical experience of literature, science, art, etc.”
    - **Relevance of SLC**
        - SLC provides wider representation in law making and wider choice in council of ministers.
        - It avoids hasty legislation
        - The nominated members who otherwise could not get elected due to intricacies of politics are also part of the law-making process due to their nomination.
        - The unique representation of elected representatives of PRIs and ULBs /teachers gives wide representation to different sections of society.

- - **Constitutional amendment with respect to state legislature**
        - The constitution of India does not allow the introduction of constitutional amendment bills (CABs) in state legislatures.
        - Those constitutional amendment bills that alter the federal structure of the constitution like 101st CAA (GST) are to be ratified by at least half of the state legislative assemblies.
        - The SC in **Kihoto Hollohan case** ruled that the majority required for ratification in the states shall be simple.
        - Those states having bicameral legislature, the views of legislative assembly shall be necessary over the view of legislative council.
    - **Law making process of SLA and SLC** 
        - A bill that is originated and passed in SLA is transmitted to the SLC.
        - If the bill is approved by the SLC, it is transmitted to the governor.
        - If the SLC rejects the bill, then the SLA shall pass the bill again and transmit to the SLC. And if the SLC rejects the bill a second time, the bill is deemed to be passed by both the houses, in the form in which it was transmitted for the second time.
        - If the SLC suggests some amendments, not acceptable to SLA, then also bill is deemed to be passed by both houses.
        - If the council does not take any action for **3 months** (when bill transmitted for the first time), then the SLA shall pass the bill for second time. If SLC does not take any action for **1 month** in the **second time**, the bill will be deemed to be passed by both the houses.
        - Therefore , the SLC does not enjoy power like Rajya Sabha i.e. deadlock or joint sitting.
        - On the other hand a bill originating from state legislative council and transmitted to SLA and is rejected by SLA, the bill dies then and there.

- - **SLC Vs Rajya Sabha**
        - **SLC** -
            - The purpose is to provide wider representation to different section of society
            - There is no provision of joint sitting in case of disagreement in both houses.
            - It is truly heterogenous with wider participation
            - No such special powers as Rajya Sabha
            - CABs can not be introduced in state legislatures. And SLC has no power in ratification.
        - **Rajya Sabha**
            - Other than wider representation, it reflects the federal character of Indian Union
            - There is a provision of joint sitting under Art 108.
            - Other than nominated members, there is homogeneity in its composition
            - Special powers to pass a resolution to empower parliament to create a new all india services.

**Federalism**

- - In the absence of an agreed definition of federalism, the constitution is judged on its federal character through the provisions of the constitution and the constitutions of the USA and Australia are said to be the benchmark of federalism.
    - Federalism in simple terms means having a government at the union, central or federal level, and one at the state level. (states are called by different names like cantons in Switzerland, republics in Russia while states in the US)
    - The governments at both levels derive their powers and existence from the constitution.
    - Indian constitution has been differently interpreted by different scholars. It is tough to label or certify it as purely federal or purely unitary.
    - Many scholars see it as quasi-federal, federal with unitary bias, cooperative federalism, sui-generis (unique).
    - The Supreme court in SR Bommai Vs Union of India, 1994, held federalism to be one of the basic structures.

The validity of that resolution shall be one year and the validity of that law shall be 6 months after the resolution ceases to be in force. The resolution can be renewed any number of times.
                - When two or more states make a request to the parliament to legislate for themselves on a matter in the state list. These laws are applicable only to those states.
                - During national emergency

            - In event of a clash between parliamentary law and state legislature’s law on the concurrent list, the parliamentary law shall prevail.
            - But if the state legislature’s law receives the assent of the president, it will override the parliamentary law for that state only.

- - **Executive Relation**
        - The laws on the Union list are normally implemented by the Union and laws on the state list are implemented by the state.
        - In the mutual delegation of executive functions both the centre and state through president and governor respectively request each other to perform each other’s executive functions at consent.
