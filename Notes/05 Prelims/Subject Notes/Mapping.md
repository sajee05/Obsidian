## A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE MAP CLASSES AND THEIR IMPORTANCE FOR THE EXAMINATION

- Both from World's perspective and India's perspective
    - **World**:
        - Political Locations - Boundaries and neighbours
        - Physical - Mountains, Plains, rivers, etc
        - Economic Aspect - Transporation, Minerals
        - Oceanic and Current related
    - **India**:

        - Environment - Wetlands, NP, TR, BR, Ramsar Sites, etc
        - Transportation, resources, etc

## BASICS OF WORLD MAPPING

- 7 Continents and 5 Oceans
    - **Pacific Ocean**, **Atlantic Ocean**, **Indian Ocean**, **Arctic Ocean**, **Southern Ocean**
    - Ocean cover 70% of the earth's surface
    - **Southern Ocean** is the fifth Ocean and is the recent edition ie in the year 2000 by **INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANISATION (IHO)** ⭐ (Grammatical error: "recent edition" should be "recent addition".)
    - **Rationale**: As it does not mix with other waters easily due to westerlies
    - Unofficially the Southern Ocean is also called **Austral Ocean**
    - ![[Mapping.jpeg]]
- ![[Mapping 1.jpeg]]
- **Pacific Ocean**:
    - The Pacific Ocean is the largest and the deepest ocean on average and has a **Pacific Ring of Fire**
    - It is twice the size of the Atlantic Ocean
    - The Pacific Ocean has the deepest point in the ocean i.e. **Mariana Trench** that is **Challenger Deep**; Major country near is the **Philippines**; Approximately it has a depth of 10, 994 metres
- **Atlantic Ocean**:
    - It is the **youngest** Ocean - 250 million years is its age
    - It is the 2nd largest ocean and is in S-shape
    - The most prominent feature is the **Mid-Atlantic Ridge** which is also in S-shape
    - The **Drake Passage** connects the Pacific Ocean with the Atlantic Ocean
    - ![[Mapping 2.jpeg]]
- **Indian Ocean**:
    - Only Ocean to be named after a country
    - The Indian Ocean is connected to land towards the North
- **Arctic Ocean**:
    - It is the smallest ocean out of all the 5 oceans
    - It has no landmass and is covered with ice
    - The area under the ice is decreasing due to Global warming

    - Due to **Arctic amplification**, the impact of Global warming is more as it has a fragile ecosystem
        - Temperature increase *2 times as compared to rest of the planet
            - **Why?**- sea ice melting reducing earth's albedo, global atmospheric winds transfer energy towards higher latitudes.
            - ![[Mapping.png]]
        - As per **IPCC’s Report (AR6)**, **Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)** is showing signs of weakness and it is very likely to decline over 21st century

- Block mountain
- Fold mountain
- Volcanic mountain

### BASED ON THE AGE OF FORMATION, THERE ARE FOUR TYPES

- **Precambrian mountains** (540 million years ago), highly weathered mountains.
    - Example Laurentian plateau (eastern Canada)
- **Caledonian mountains** 450 to 350 Mya (old fold mountains)
    - Example 1 Appalachian Mountain, rich in iron ore and coal reserves.
    - Example 2 - Aravalli in India
    - Example 3 - Great Dividing Range.
    - Example3 - Southern alps (New Zealand)- The highest peak is Mt cook (aka Aoraki)
- **Hercynian mountains** Formed during (250 to 350 Mya) aka block mountain.
    - Example Black Forest (on the border of Germany and France). It’s the horst and graben in Rhine valley, Vosges is block mountain (horst)
        - Black forest source of Danube River
    - Ural mountain (partly Block Mountain due to rifting and it’s also old fold mountain) between Siberian and Eastern Russia
