### MOHAMMAD SHAH (1719-1748)

### DECLINE OF THE MUGHALS:

-   The hierarchy in the Mughal Court:

![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Modern Indian History - आधुनिक भारतीय इतिहास 1.png]]

-   The power flowed in the following sequence:
    -   Mughal Emperor -> Wazir (Prime Minister): The most important minister.
    -   Nobility : After the wazir. They were generally jaghirdars, etc.
    -   Nobility consisted of Turkish (**TURRANI**), Persian (**IRANI**), Afghans (**DURRANI**) and Hindustani nobles.

#### MANSABDARI SYSTEM:

-   It is a Persian word, meaning ‘official position’.
-   It was the system of ranking the officials in the Mughal Kingdom, which was initiated by Emperor **AKBAR**.
-   It had two components, i.e. ‘**ZAT**’ and ‘**SAWAR**’.

##### _ZAT:_

-   **ZAT** is indicative of the personal rank of a **MANSABDAR** in the official hierarchy.
-   The ranking system started from 100 till 5000, but Mughal princes and the closest allies or kings of exceptional capabilities were given the 7000 rank.
-   The highest rank is 7000, Lowest was 100.
-   For the general public, the ranks of 100 to 5000 were given, 7000 was reserved for the Mughal sons.
-   Many times the 7000 rank was given to many important allies, kings of exceptional capabilities.
-   Methods of salary payment was Cash (or **NAKADI**) and Land payment (**JAGIRDARI**) to **MANSABDARS**.
-   Whenever the payment was in the cash, the officer was known as the ‘**NAKADI**’ **MANSABDAR**. (**NAKADI**= Persian for cash).
-   And those who got land grants were known as **JAGIRDARS** (jagir = land grant in form of a piece of land).

##### There were two types of jagirs:

-   **TANKHWAH JAGIR** (given for a temporary period, not hereditary and non-transferable).
-   **WATAN JAGIR** (Given permanently, was hereditary and transferable).
-   Near about 80% of the land was granted as jagir, and 20% was **KHALISA LAND**, i.e. Royal land (directly under the Emperor).

##### _SAWAR:_

-   It reflected up to the responsibilities of the **MANSABDARS**, towards the Mughal Empire.
-   It is indicative of the number of horses to be maintained by the **MANSABDAR** in the Army for the service of Mughal Emperor.

#### JAGIRDARS:

-   They were Mughal Nobles who were granted _Jagir_ in lieu of their service.
-   They needed to collect revenue and maintain an army for the service of the Mughal Empire.
-   Land grants were temporary in nature.

#### ZAMINDARS:

-   They were hereditary landlords, local powerful rajas, local chieftains, and they also were part of Mughal Nobility.
-   They needed to collect revenue, from their respective areas.
-   They also had judicial powers and they needed to maintain law and order in their area.
-   Land grants were permanent in nature.

The decline of Mughals began with the death of **AURANGZEB** in 1707, though the factors of decline were already present from the 17th century itself. The causes can be enumerated as follows:

#### Political causes:

-   **AURANGZEB’S** expansionist campaigns in **BIJAPUR**, **GOLCONDA**, and Maratha area are believed to have sapped the vitality of the Mughal Empire.
-   After the death of **AURANGZEB**, there was no clear line of succession, in between 1707 to 1720, near about 7 rulers were appointed to the throne.
-   Bitter factionalism in Mughal Court was precipitated, whereby the **IRANI**, **TURRANI**, **DURRANI**, and Hindustani nobles started to increase their influence and later on they carved out autonomous states from themselves.

#### Economic Causes:

-   The Mughal state has been described as a ‘war state’ in its core.
-   It sought to develop a centralized administrative system (**MANSABDARI**), whose vitality depended on the military might of the Mughals.
-   The **JAGIRDARI CRISIS** also involved the emergence of too many **JAGIRDARS** chasing for very few Jagirs.
-   These Jagirs were highly unequal in size which triggered intense competition with the nobility.
-   **AURANGZEB** converted a large part of the Deccan region into **KHALISA LAND** (i.e. royal land).
-   And thus even expansion into Deccan did not significantly increase the number of available jagirs.
-   Attempts to increase revenue by increasing tax rates often resulted in peasant revolt against the rulers.

#### Socio-Religious Causes:

-   The religious divisive policy of **AURANGZEB** was one of the most important factors of decline.
-   For example; re-imposition of **JIZYA** tax and destruction of Hindu temples.
-   Because of which people developed a grudge against the Mughals.

#### Military related Causes:

-   There was no fresh technological input in the Mughal army during the 18th century.
-   And thus, when faced with a superior opponent, i.e. British, the Mughal army proved to be inferior.

## EMERGENCE OF REGIONAL POWERS IN 18TH CENTURY:

-   Successor states (**BENGAL**, **AWADH**, **HYDERABAD**)
-   Rebellious states (**PUNJAB**, **MARATHA**, **MYSORE**)

### SUCCESSOR STATES OF MUGHALS:

-   The rulers of these states were the erstwhile nobility of the Mughals or they were Mughal Governors.
-   They went on to carve out autonomous states for themselves.
-   But they did not cut their links completely with the Mughals.
-   They **respected the nominal rule of the Mughals**.
-   Coins were minted with the name of the Mughal Emperor.
-   Friday prayers were done in the name of Mughal emperors.
-   They also paid annual tributes to the Mughal Emperor.
-   E.g.: **HYDERABAD**, **BENGAL**, **AWADH**.

### REBELLIOUS STATES:

-   Founders of these states were not part of Mughal nobility.
-   These were independent kingdoms, but during the regime of Mughals (**AURANGZEB**), some of their areas came under Mughal control.
-   After the death of **AURANGZEB**, the rulers of these states asserted their independence and autonomy.
-   They did not accept the nominal rule of the Mughals.
-   E.g.: **PUNJAB**, **MARATHAS**, **MYSORE**.

### ANGLO-FRENCH RIVALRY: (CARNATIC WARS)

#### HYDERABAD:

-   **CHIN QILICH KHAN** (**NIZAM UL-MULK ASAF JHA**) was a Noble of the Turkish group (**TURRANI**).
-   In between, 1713-1722 he was the Governor of the Deccan.
-   He supported **MUHAMMAD SHAH** in the killing of the **SAYYED BROTHERS**.
-   In return, he was offered the post of Wazir in the Mughal Empire at **DELHI**.
-   As a Wazir, he tried to reform the corrupt Mughal Administration. But earned many enemies for himself.
-   Disgusted with the suspicious nature of the Mughal Emperor he decided to pursue his own ambition.
-   In 1724, he killed **MUBARIZ KHAN** in the **BATTLE OF KHEDA** and established the **ASAF JAHI DYNASTY** in **HYDERABAD**.
-   (**MUBARIZ KHAN** was the Governor of Deccan).

#### CARNATIC:

-   The **CARNATIC** region comprised of the Coromandel coast & its hinterland.
-   It was one of the Mughal Province which came under the authority of the Governor of **HYDERABAD**.
-   But just as in practice **HYDERABAD** became independent of **DELHI**, so did the **CARNATIC**.
-   The Deputy Governor of **CARNATIC**, **SADAT ALLAH KHAN** freed himself from the control of **HYDERABAD** & made his office hereditary.
-   Around the 1740s the political affairs in **CARNATIC** started to deteriorate because of **MARATHAS** invasion.
-   At this time the French company decided to intervene in **CARNATIC** politics to get political mileage.
-   Very soon the English Company also started to intervene in the politics of **CARNATIC**.
-   This led to a bitter war between the English & French for the next 23 years.
-   These wars are referred to as **CARNATIC WARS**.

#### FIRST CARNATIC WAR (1742-1748):

-   The **WAR OF AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION** which started on 20th October 1740 after the death of **MONARCH CHARLES-IV** led to the outbreak of the **CARNATIC WARS**.
-   Britain was supporting the claim of **MARIA THERESA** & France supported **ROBERT CHARLES ALBERT**.
-   This led both the companies to fight with each other, i.e The French & British companies present in the different parts of the world also started to fight with each other.
-   French Governor **JOSEPH FRANCOIS DUPLEIX** decided to attack British possessions in **MADRAS**.
-   As a result, the English surrendered **MADRAS** to the French.

## PILLARS OF BRITISH ADMINISTRATION

### CIVIL SERVICES

-   The creator of modern civil services in India was **LORD CORNWALLIS**.
-   Earlier **COURT OF DIRECTORS** exercised the power of nominating the civil servants resulting in favouritism and corruption.
-   **CORNWALLIS** tried to address this problem by banning private trade, raising salary, and enforcing promotion based on seniority.
-   At this time, **EIC** civil servants were the highest-paid civil services in the world.
-   **CORNWALLIS** adopted a short-sighted policy of the Europeanization of services.
-   He made sure that no Indian must enter Civil Services.
-   It was officially led down that all the higher posts in administration, worth more than 500-pound annual salary could be held only by English.
-   In order to provide training to Civil servants, Governor-General **WELLESLEY** established Civil servants training college at **FORT WILLIAMS, CALCUTTA**.
-   But later it was disapproved by the **COURT OF DIRECTORS** in Britain.
-   They established a separate Civil Servant Training Institute at **HAILEYBURY** in England in 1806.

### ARMY

-   There were 2 branches of the British army:
    -   **QUEEN'S ARMY** - There were only Britishers in **QUEEN'S ARMY**, It was the army of occupation and ultimate guarantee of British hold over India.
    -   **TROOPS ARMY** - This army had British Officers and Indian soldiers, It was the army of annexation, fighting wars, and expansion of British territory.
-   Native against native approach was used with the concept of martial races.
-   The Britishers were quite sure since the beginning that they could not dominate India without creating divisions in Indian Society.
-   In the theory of the Martial race, they claimed that Gurkha, Rajput, Sikh, Pathan be the Martial races.
-   The bulk of the Company's army was comprised of Indian Soldiers (86%).
-   Keeping a British army would have been a very expensive affair.
-   All officers were British.
-   The highest post that an Indian can reach was **SUBEDAR**.
-   It is surprising that a handful of Britishers could control a predominant Indian Army.
-   The control by the British could be attributed to the absence of modern nationalism in India at that time.
-   Also, Indians had a strong tradition of loyalty towards the salt, As such Indian soldiers acted as good mercenaries and British as good pay masters.

### POLICE

-   In Pre-colonial India, particularly during the Mughal period, law and order were the responsibility of **AMILS**, **FAUJDARS**, and **KOTWALS**.
-   In **BIHAR**, **BENGAL** and **ORISSA** **ZAMINDARS** were also responsible for maintaining law and order.
-   **ZAMINDARS** created their own personal for the duty of law and order in their area i.e. **THANEDAR**.
-   Later it was observed that there was often dereliction of duty on the part of **ZAMINDAR** which necessitated a change in the law and order system.
-   **CORNWALLIS** relieved all **ZAMINDARS** from the duty of maintaining law and order.
-   **ZAMINDARS** were replaced by an organized police force under the command of **EIC**.
-   Districts were divided into different circles known as **THANA**, to manage the affairs of **THANA** a **DAROGA** was appointed.
-   **SP** was appointed at the district level.
-   **WILLIAM BENTICK** abolished the office of **SP** and placed law and order under the **DISTRICT COLLECTOR**.
-   In 1860, the **POLICE COMMISSION** was appointed which led to the enaction of the **POLICE ACT, 1861**.

### JUDICIARY

-   The initiative to start the modern judiciary system was taken by **WARREN HASTINGS**.
-   **DIWANI ADALAT** was set up based on the Mughal model and it was responsible for trial of civil cases, **SADR DIWANI ADALAT** was the appellate body. ( i.e. appeals from **DIWANI ADALAT** entertained here).
-   **FAUJADARI ADALAT** was created for criminal cases, from there Appeals went to **SADR NIZAMAT ADALAT**.
-   These courts followed both Hindu and Muslim laws.
-   **CORNWALLIS** in 1793 brought the '**CORNWALLIS CODE**' based on the separation of power whereby he divested the collector of all his judicial powers and left him with the duty of revenue administration.
-   **LORD CORNWALLIS** brought further changes and abolished **DIWANI** & **FAUJADARI ADALAT** and in its place he created district **ADALAT'S** (**JILA ADALAT**) which entertained both civil and criminal cases.
-   He also created 4 - provincial court of Appeal (civil) and Circuit (criminal) at **DHAKA**, **MURSHIDABAD**, **PATNA** and **CALCUTTA** which entertain appeals from district court.
-   **CORNWALLIS** started the appointed of Covenanted civil servants to decide th e cases in 4 - provincial courts of appeal and circuit. These European officers were supported by Hindu and Muslim law Expert like **QAZI**, **MUFTI** and **PANDIT**.
-   He established the hierarchy of courts in India at different levels.
-   **Hierarchy**: **MUNSIF COURT** -> **REGISTRAR COURT** -> District Court (**ZILA ADALAT**) -> 4 Courts of Circuit and appeal -> **SADR DIWANI** & **SADR NIZAMAT**. **SUPREME COURT AT CALCUTTA** -> **KING IN COUNCIL**.
-   Highest court: **KING IN COUNCIL** - But it entertained only those cases where the disputed amount was more than 5000 Rs.
-   The Jurisdiction of **CALCUTTA SUPREME COURT** was limited to British employees in and around **CALCUTTA**.

![[Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Modern Indian History - आधुनिक भारतीय इतिहास 5.png]]

-   1831: **WILLIAM BENTICK** abolished Four provincial courts of appeal and circuit and established judicial commissionaires and transferred the functions of abolished court to **DM**.

On the basis of Recommendation of this commission **IPC 1860**, **CPC 1861** (civil) were Enacted. Further recommendations led to establishment of 3 High courts in 1865 at **CALCUTTA**, **MADRAS** and **BOMBAY**.

### LAND REVENUE SETTLEMENT UNDER THE BRITISH

#### _PERMANENT SETTLEMENT SYSTEM(ZAMINDARI BANDOBST):_

-   In order to generate sufficient revenue for a longer period of time.
-   It was introduced by **LORD CORNWALLIS** in 1793.
-   It was introduced in the province of **BIHAR** and **BENGAL** and **ORISSA**.
-   Later it was extended to **VARANASI** and the Northern districts of **MADRAS**.
-   It covered 19 % of British Indian territory.
-   The settlement was between the **ZAMINDAR** and the British authorities.
-   The **ZAMINDARS** were entitled to land ownership.
-   It was permanent, hereditary and transferrable.
-   However, Company retained ultimate ownership and if **ZAMINDAR** defaults on payment, the land could be sold or auctioned.
-   The revenue was permanently fixed that 10/11 of the total revenue will be submitted to British authorities and **ZAMINDARS** can keep 1/11 of total revenue for themselves.
-   The rate of taxes on peasants was at the discretion of the **ZAMINDAR** and that were fixed arbitrarily.
-   In the law, there was a provision of the agreement between peasants and **ZAMINDARS** but was never exercised in person.
-   Under the settlement there was a **SUNSET CLAUSE**:
    -   The date of submission of revenue was pre-fixed.
    -   **ZAMINDARS** needed to submit the revenue before the sunset of the pre-fixed date.
    -   If **ZAMINDAR** was not able to submit the revenue on time, then the land ownership right was snatched from him.
-   There was no provision for relief for peasants even in times of natural disasters and crop failures.

##### REASONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:

-   To generate sufficient revenue for longer period of time for bearing the administrative expense and the expansion of Indian territory at the minimum cost incurred in revenue collection.
-   To create a new class of **ZAMINDARS** who is a friendly and firm supporter of British rule.

##### OUTCOMES:

-   It gave a fixed permanent income for the British.
-   But the Britishers were not allowed to increase land revenue before the fixed period.
-   Though the majority of **ZAMINDARS** reaped huge benefits, some of them lost their land ownership rights.
-   It led to the rise of a large number of intermediaries, absentee landlords, and money lenders.

##### EFFECT ON PEASANTS:

-   Peasants are reduced to the status of hand-to-mouth existence.
-   Moreover, they were also caught in a vicious cycle of debt.
-   This happened because they had to take money from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates.
-   There was widespread discontent among peasants which later fuelled many peasant revolts.
-   It increased a large number of landless laborers.
-   It led to the deterioration of the fertility of agricultural land as there was no investment from the side of the British and **ZAMINDARS** on agricultural land.
-   Peasants were not having the capacity to invest in the land.

#### _RYOTWARI AND MAHALWARI SYSTEM_

##### RYOTWARI SYSTEM

-   Introduced in 1792 by **CAPTAIN REED** with help of **THOMAS MUNRO** in the **BARA MAHAL** region in Karnataka.
-   In 1820, **MUNRO** introduced it in **MADRAS PRESIDENCY** and **ELPHINSTONE** introduced it in the **BOMBAY PRESIDENCY**.
-   It covered about 50% of the British Indian Territory.
-   It was direct settlement between British authorities and Peasants.

###### PROVISIONS

-   Land ownership rights were given to ryots and It was hereditary and transferable.
-   Land revenue was directly negotiated with the peasants.
-   Contrary to permanent settlement, the revenue rates were to be revised after an interval of 30 years.
-   Ryots had to pay the revenue before a pre-fixed date and time - If not so, he was evicted from the land and British authorities can sell the land through the process of auctioning.
-   For calculation and imposition of taxes, a comparative scientific method was adopted whereby the land was surveyed and classified. moreover the total expense of growing a crop was deducted before fixing the tax rate. It was also proposed in the law that after deducting the expense, the revenue rate cannot be fixed more than 50%, but in reality, it was not followed.
-   There was the provision of relief to ryots in the situation of natural calamities or crop failures, but in reality, not given relief.
-   British took the help of **POLYGARS** and **MIRASIDARS** in South India - to collect the revenue.

###### REASONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

-   As there is no provision of revision in the permanent settlement.
-   As per **UTILITARIAN THOUGHT**, land ownership right was to be retained to be with ryots so that they can spend their efforts and energy in maintaining the fertility of land.
-   Due to the industrial revolution, there was a huge demand for raw material supplies from India.

###### OUTCOME

-   Increase in the British revenue, raw material supply to Britain.
-   Led to increased administrative expense.
-   Peasants were still exploited and marginalised by greedy officials and British agents etc.
-   Moreover they were oppressed by moneylenders who charged high interest rates on loans.
-   It did not eliminated village Elites like baramins, **POLYGARS** and **MIRASIDARS**, gradually positioned themselves comfortably in the subordinate ranks of the revenue establishments.
-   Some of them brought lucrative & large tracks of irrigated land after getting their official appointment.
-   Enhancement of power of elites resulted in cohesion, bribery and corruption by subordinate officials. it led to establishment of **MADRAS TORTURE COMMISSION, 1855**, which maintained that there is a dire need of reform in the **RYOTWARI** settlement.

##### MAHAL WARI SYSTEM

-   **MAHAL** word means landed state, but in this settlement, it was recognized as a single economic entity which could be a group of one or more villages or a big landed state of landlords.
-   It was implemented in 30% area of British India.
-   In 1819, **HOLT MACKENZIE** gave the suggestion to implement as such in 1822 it was introduced in western **U.P**.
-   In 1833, **MARTIN BIRD** extended it to the rest of North India.
-   The landownership right was retained with hereditary landowners, be it big landlords or common peasantry.
-   It was hereditary and transferrable.
-   For revenue collection, the **MAHAL** unit was created and an agreement was signed with the village headman **TALUKDAAR**, **THIKADAARS** and **LAMBARDAR**.
-   Non-payment of the revenue on time led to eviction from the land.
-   For the first time, a map was used and a land record was maintained in the register, also there was provisions to conduct field to field surveys for revenue assessments.

###### OUTCOMES

-   The revenue rates were exorbitant and highly oppressive as such no economic benefit was trickling down to small and middle peasantry.
-   The survey which was the core of new arrangement failed because it was too complex to be carried out with the existing Machinery. The obvious Result was over assessment based on idiosyncratic estimates.
-   **COMMERCIALIZATION OF AGRICULTURE** started to happen at a rapid pace in **MAHALWARI** concerned areas.
-   Moreover, it was very much observed that land became a commodity that could be sold and mortgaged.
-   The **AGRICULTURAL DEPRESSION, 1828** worsened the situation, with the Rising debt burden peasants started to sell their land like a commodity. In other words it led to the increased pace of commodification of land.
-   The grievances of the rural society at North India war soon to be expressed rather loudly and violently in the revolt of 1857.

## PEASANTS AND TRIBAL UPRISING

### BENGAL AND EASTERN INDIA.

#### CHUAR UPRISING (1766 - 1795):

-   It happened in the **MIDNAPORE** region of **BENGAL**.

## REVOLT OF 1857

-   In the history of modern India year, 1857 is marked the beginning of a new era and the end of an old era.

### CAUSES

-   The causes are so inextricably woven together, that it was difficult to determine the sequence in which they arose.
-   There was a fateful combination of the circumstances.
-   Which didn’t appear in the past and not tended to reoccur.

### MILITARY REASONS

-   British authority decided to replace the old **BROWN BESS MUSKET** with the new **ENFIELD RIFLES**.
-   The new riffle was chosen for its longer range and greater accuracy.
-   In this new riffle sepoys needed to bite off a paper from the cartridge before loading it.
-   It was alleged that the paper was smeared with cow and pig fat, which provoked Hindus and Muslim sepoys' religious sentiments.
-   They forged a united resistance against the British.
-   It made it obligatory that sepoys go on duty wherever ordered then it led to sepoys suspecting that Britishers were trying to convert their religion to Christianity.
-   On a professional level, an Indian sepoy was paid 1/3rd of salary as compared to a European sepoy.
-   Moreover, there was racial discrimination in the matters of promotion, and Indian sepoys were treated roughly abused, and humiliated.
-   In 1854, the **POST OFFICE ACT 1854** was enacted which withdrew all the postage privileges of the sepoys.
-   The majority of the recruits in the British army were from **BENGAL**, **AWADH**, and northwest frontier province where caste consolidation was deeper.
-   The high cast brahmins, Rajput’s and Pathans didn’t like to be treated on par with lower caste recruits and they were disaffected with this.
-   Initially, soldiers were paid **BHATTA**/ allowance when they were posted far from their home by 1850 it was also withdrawn.
-   By the 1850s British army faced reverses in **AFGHANISTAN** and **PREMIUM**;
-   which generated a feeling that the British are not invincible.

### ECONOMIC CAUSES

**Exploitative land revenue system**.

-   Various land revenue settlements like permanent, **RYOTWARI**, **MAHALWARI** by the British meant a loss of land for landholders and heavy taxation to cultivators.
-   The tax rates under all the systems were heavy and oppressive.
-   Moreover, it was collected even at the time of crop failure.
-   In such situations, peasants took loans from the local **MAHAJAN** or moneylender who charged exorbitant interest rates, leading to peasants being caught in a vicious cycle of debt and commodification of land.
-   The economic decline of the Indian peasantry was further reflected in 12 major and many minor famines between 1770 – 1857.

#### DESTRUCTION OF INDIAN HANDICRAFT TRADE AND INDUSTRY

-   The company traders enjoyed various privileges such as duty-free trade which made their products comparatively cheaper.
-   British policy also did not lead to fall of Indian industry in fact their policy was all about supporting the industrial revolution in Britain.

#### CONFISCATION OF THE RENT-FREE STATE

-   1850, the British government appointed a tribunal to look into titled deeds of states which were given rent-free status.
-   The **INAM COMMISSION** pronounced confiscation of 21000 rent-free states.
-   In this, the people who suffered the most were **MAULVIS**, **ULEMAS**, **PANDITS** who enjoyed a rent-free state for maintenance of religious service.
-   They played a very active role in the revolt.

### SOCIO-RELIGIOUS CAUSES

-   The British system in India was identified with a certain degree of social reform but it created ambivalence in the Indian society.
-   Though some of the people favoured the reform majority was against it.
-   They believed that the British had no business to interfere in the social affairs of India.
-   Moreover, the bad faith of the British government further alienated the Indians, and always referred to them as bigots, barbaric and animalistic, etc.
-   Moreover, they were also highly disaffected with the proselytizing activities of Christian missionaries.
-   **RELIGIOUS DISABILITY ACT 1850** instilled among Hindu community whereby British were trying to alter many of the Hindu customs.

### POLITICAL CAUSES

-   **AWADH** and **PUNJAB** have annexed in defence of treaty rights.
-   **BERAR** was snatched from Nizam of **HYDERABAD**.

### THE COURSE OF THE REVOLT

-   29th of march 1857 :- in **BARRACKPORE** in **CALCUTTA** the sepoys of 34th infantry refused to use the new rifle as such it was disbanded.

    -   As such, he was overpowered and hanged.
-   Soon the mutiny started to spread to **AMBALA**, **LUCKNOW**, and **AWADH**.
-   The real outbreak is believed to be mutiny at **MEERUT**.
-   On the 23rd of April 1857, sepoys refused to use the greased cartridges.
    -   As such, they were tried by a court-martial and sentenced to 10 years of hard labour on 9th May 1857.

## FACTORS THAT FAVOURED THE RISE OF NATIONALISM IN INDIA

-   **Collision of the interest**- many classes of Indian societies like capitalist, intelligentsia, laborers, artisans, and peasants considered the very presence of the British detrimental to their interest.
-   **Political and administrative unification of India**- to serve their imperial interest, Britishers unified India politically, administratively, and economically. It also led to the unification of grievances and people in different parts of India started to consider the British as their common enemy.
-   **Development of modern transport and communication**- by 1900, 25000 miles were laid down by the British. **EDWIN ARNOLD** in 1865 prophesized “Railways may do for India what dynasties have never done. What the genius of **AKBAR** could not affect by his good governance nor the autocratic rule of **TIPU SULTAN**, railways have made India a nation.”
-   The introduction of the modern postal system and electric telegraph system enabled nationalist literature to circulate more widely to the different parts of the country.
-   **Development in Education**- the inaugural of English education proved to be momentous in the rise and growth of nationalism. Ideas of **JEREMY BENTHAM**, **SPENCER**, **JAMES STUART MILL**, **VOLTAIRE**, **ROUSSEAU**, **MONTESQUIEU**, etc. inspired the class of newly educated Indian intelligentsia with the ideas of liberty, nation, and self-government, separation of power, the law of nature, utilitarianism, etc.
-   Some of the Indian people who had the first-hand experience of working in Britain had found that the condition in India was slavish. After coming to India, they started to demand better basic rights for Indians.
-   **Role of press and vernacular literature**- The first printing press in India was established by **JAMES AUGUSTUS HICKEY** which led to the establishment of vernacular press in India in the latter half of the 19th century.
-   There was huge growth in vernacular literature which includes Indian Mirror, Bengalee, Anand Bazar Patrika, Kesari, Mahratta, The Hindu, Indu Prakash, etc.
-   These newspapers exposed the excesses of the British administration in India.
-   **Rise of the new middle class**- the new middle class came from varied background regions and religions. After mastering the English language, they reached basic questions regarding orthodox practices and customs. They emphasized introspection and tried to forge an all India identity.
-   **Impact of revolutionary activities abroad** - a number of nation-states came to picture in South America on the ruins of Spanish and Portuguese empires. Educated Indians were inspired by this.
-   **Rediscovery of India’s past and cultural nationalism**- a degree of self-respect and confidence was brought about by the historical research and excavations. E.g.- **INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION**.
-   **The philosophical and literary merit of VEDAS and UPANISHADS** further boosted the morale of educated Indians who were inspired by the new spirit of nationalism.
-   **The policy of racial discrimination**- Britishers perpetuated the racial myth of white superiority. They followed a deliberate policy of stamping out Indians from the process of administration. E.g.- The maximum age of **ICS** was reduced to 19 years from 21.
-   **ILBERT BILL CONTROVERSY 1883**- The **ILBERT BILL** proposed that Europeans and Britishers can also be tried by senior Indian judges if they have committed any offense. But, in the face of stiff opposition Bill was modified which made it very clear to the nationalist that justice and fair play could not be expected where the interest of the European community is also involved at the same time.

## THE ECONOMIC CRITIQUE OF COLONIALISM

-   The high priest of economic critique and drain theory was **DADABHAI NAROJI** and **RC DUTT** and the other important leaders included **MAHADEV GOVIND RANADE**, **GV JOSHI**, **G SUBRAMANIAN IYER**, **PC RAY**, **GOPAL KRISHNA GOKHALE** who analysed every aspect of the Indian economy.
-   These leaders raised basic questions regarding the nature and purpose of British rule.
-   These leaders explained colonial structures in all the aspects of economies i.e. trade, industry, and finance.
-   Trade - there was one-way trade for the Britishers, while Indian producers who can still compete were charged with heavy-duty.
-   Industry - in industry, India was made the place of raw material supply. In finances, the development of railways led to heavy foreign capital investment which created vested interest and they demanded security for investing which further perpetuated foreign rule.

### THEORY OF DRAIN OF WEALTH

-   **DADABHAI NAROJI** in 1861 said that Britain was draining and bleeding India.
-   **JOHN SULLIVAN** who was the president of the Board of Revenue **MADRAS** added “Our system acts like a sponge, drawing up all the good things from the banks of **GANGES** and squeezing them down to the banks of **THAMES**”.
-   Early nationalists declared that the drain was the basic cause of India’s poverty and the fundamental evil of British rule in India.
-   Remittances to Britain.
-   Home charges of Indian government (In Britain).
-   Excess of export over import for which India got no economic benefit.

## EARLY POLITICAL ORGANISATION

### LANDHOLDER’S SOCIETY

-   By **DWARKA NATH TAGORE** and **RADHA KANT DEB**.
-   To protect and safeguard the rights of zamindars.

### BRITISH INDIA SOCIETY OF BENGAL

-   Started in 1843 by **GEORGE THOMSON**.
-   The purpose was to protect and safeguard the rights of the common public.

### BRITISH INDIA ASSOCIATION OF 1851 –

-   Formed by the merger of **LANDHOLDER’S SOCIETY** and **BRITISH INDIA SOCIETY OF BENGAL**.
-   It will safeguard the rights of both the common public and zamindars.

## FOUNDATION OF INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS

-   All the regional organizations and their leaders realized by 1885 the time has come to create a common platform of pan India nature.
-   To create political awareness among the masses.
-   The idea of creating all Indian organizations was given formal shape by a retired British civil servant **AO HUME**.
-   The first meeting was convened at **GOKULDAS TEJPAL SANSKRIT COLLEGE** in **BOMBAY**.
-   The assembly was presided by **WOMESH CHANDER BANERJEE**.

-   First Indian women congress president - **SAROJINI NAIDU**.
-   The first woman to address the congress session – **KADIMBINI GANGULY**. (1898).

### THEORY OF SAFETY VALVE

-   As per the imperialist view, **AO HUME** was solely responsible for the creation of the **INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS** to provide a safe outlet to ventilate the grievances of the rising middle class.
-   Also to avert any major uprising or revolt.
-   However, this view was not accepted by the nationalists.
-   According to them, no single individual was responsible for the formation of **INC** and it was the result of early political organization and the early nationalist leaders.
-   All things considered, it can be said that if **AO HUME** was using **INC** as a safety valve, then the early nationalists were using them as a lightning conductor, in order to avoid official suspicion regarding their intention.

### THE FIRST PHASE OF INDIAN FREEDOM STRUGGLE (1885- 1905) – MODERATE PHASE

-   In the beginning, the early nationalists demanded to increase the number of Indians in the legislative council and grant them more political rights.
-   They also demanded reforms in Indian civil services so as Indians are not in a disadvantageous position as compared to Europeans.
-   Creating political awareness among the masses and economic critique of colonialism.
-   As far as the methods of early nationalists are concerned, they adopted methods of constitutional agitation, prayers, and petitions within the four walls of law.
-   They preferred peaceful agitation and never had faith in the capacity of the masses.
-   Though they didn't initiate mass struggle but, the political awareness created by them was facilitated by future mass struggle by the people.

### THE SECOND PHASE OF FREEDOM STRUGGLE (1905-1915)

-   In 1905, the British authority decided to divide the province of **BENGAL** into two parts i.e., east **BENGAL** with a Muslim majority population including present-day Bangladesh.
-   Assam and West **BENGAL** with the Hindu majority population including **BENGAL**, **BIHAR**, and **ORISSA**.
-   With the announcement of this decision, the Indian national movement entered into the second phase.
-   The partition was affected on the 16th of October 1905.
-   At this point in time, the extremists' leaders of the congress were of the view that prayers and petitions must be backed with passive resistance.
-   The greatest representative of this thought was **BAL GANGADHAR TILAK**.
-   **TILAK** preached his militant ideas through his newspaper - **MAHRATTA** in English and **KESARI** in Marathi.
-   He also started to celebrate the **GANPATI FESTIVAL** in 1893 and the **SHIVAJI FESTIVAL** in 1895 to increase his popularity.
-   He gave provocative speeches against the British.
-   He was supported by the nationalist like **LALA LAJPAT RAI**, **BIPIN CHANDER PAL**, and **AUROBINDO GHOSH**.
-   Due to the methods adopted by them, they came to know their own as extremists leaders of the congress.

### SWADESHI MOVEMENT

-   In the context of the partition of **BENGAL**, the annual session of congress was convened at **BANARAS** in 1905.
-   It was presided by **GOPAL KRISHNA GOKHALE**, he sanctioned the beginning of the **SWADESHI MOVEMENT** with the boycott of **MANCHESTER CLOTH** and **LIVERPOOL SALT**.
-   The **SWADESHI** and the boycott movement were interlinked and they were based on self-reliance.

The major contribution of the **SWADESHI MOVEMENT** was in the cultural sphere which is as follows -

#### BENGAL

-   At this time, **BANKIM CHANDER CHATTERJEE'S** composition **VANDE MATARAM** became the theme song of the Indian national movement.

-   Finally, British authorities banned the booklet in 1910.
-   **VO CHIDAMBARAM PILLAI** founded the steam navigation company of India.

#### LIMITATIONS OF THE SWADESHI MOVEMENT

-   It could not garner the support of Muslim masses in **BENGAL** due to two important reasons.
-   Divide and rule policy followed by British authorities and reactionary leadership among the Muslim masses.
-   This led to the establishment of **ALL INDIA MUSLIM LEAGUES**.

### ALL INDIA MUSLIM LEAGUE

-   In 1906, **AGHA KHAN** and nawab **SALIM ULLAH OF DACCA** founded **AIML** with the support of then viceroy **MINTO**.

-   Moreover, they maintained that their intention is not to create disharmony in the society and the Muslim league will remain loyal to the British authority.
-   In the national front scenario, the annual congress session was to be held in **CALCUTTA**.
-   At this time, the differences between the moderate and the extremists congress leaders started to emerge.
-   Extremists leaders wanted an all-out boycott of British goods and services.
-   On the other hand, moderates wanted to use boycott in a limited way.
-   In the **CALCUTTA** session, moderates proposed the name of **DADA BHAI NAOROJI** for the post of president.
-   Since **NAOROJI** was quite respected among the extremists also as such they did not oppose his candidature.

-   After 1907, **SURAT-SPLIT**, both the factions of Congress were in a disadvantageous position.
-   During **WWI**, requisitioning of the supplies particularly, cereals led to high inflation in food.
-   Cash crops also suffered because exports declined and the European market was completely cut for the Indian exporters.
-   Moreover, there was no relief in the taxation.
-   The assurance of self-rule given by the British also seemed to be a blatant lie in the midst of war.
-   **TILAK** and **ANNIE BESANT** were ready to assume the leadership.

###### HOME RULE LEAGUE AND ITS ACTIVITIES

-   **TILAK** maintained that he wanted reform in the administration on the lines of the **IRISH HOME RULE LEAGUE**.

-   Some members of **GOPAL KRISHAN GOKHALE'S SERVANT'S SOCIETY OF INDIA** also joined the home rule agitation.

###### HOME RULE LEAGUE

**Objectives and Methods:**

**British Response**:

-   Britishers came down with severe repression particularly in **MADRAS**.

-   In June 1917, Britishers arrested **ANNIE BESANT**, **WADIA** and **GEORGE ARUNDALE**.
-   It led to a chain reaction in India and in a dramatic gesture **SIR S SUBRAMANYA IYER** renounced his Knighthood.
-   **MONTAGU**, the Secretary of the State commented that Shiva cut his wife into 52 pieces only to discover that he had 52 wives.
-   This is what happens to the Government of India when it interns to **MADAM ANNIE BESANT**.

-   Moreover, at the height of her popularity, she became the **FIRST WOMEN PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS IN 1917**.

**Fading out of the Home Rule Agitation**:

-   Declaration of British PM on 20th August 1917.
-   The aim of British authority is to establish a responsible government in India.
-   As such a committee was constituted under the chairmanship of Secretary of State **MONTAGUE** in order to provide a responsible government to Indians.
-   In July 1918, reforms were made public, **ANNIE BESANT** accepted it and withdrew Home Rule Agitation.
-   In 1918 only, **TILAK** went to London to file a suit against **VALENTINE CHIROLE** who claimed **TILAK** was the Father of the Indian unrest.
-   **TILAK** was away for several months and his home rule movement became dysfunctional.

**Contribution of Home Rule Movement**

-   It created a large group of ardent nationalists especially in the remotest part of the country.
-   It also facilitated the reach of print media to the remotest part of the country.
-   It created organisational links between the nationalists in urban areas with the masses in rural areas.
-   It provided a platform for a mass movement in the subsequent phase of the national struggle.

###### INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (INC) SESSION OF 1916 (LUCKNOW)

-   It was presided by **AMBIKA CHARAN MAZUMDAR**.
-   The session led to the reunification of both the branches of congress.

**Lucknow Pact:**

-   Congress accepted the concept of a separate electorate for Muslims.
-   They also accepted that Muslims should be given 1/3rd representation in central government.
-   They demanded to the British authorities the right of self-government.
-   They also demanded to increase the number of members in central and provincial legislative councils.

**Critical Analysis:**

-   It was based on the belief that Hindus and Muslims are separate political entities.
-   It may lead to a domino effect whereby other communities will also start demanding separate electorates for themselves.
-   It was also like opening the gateways of future communalism.
-   On a positive note, for a short period of time, it allayed the fear of majority domination among the minorities.

**Montagu's Statement**:

-   He declared that the British government policy in India is of increasing participation of Indians in every branch of administration.
-   And the gradual development of the self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realization of the responsible government of India as an integral part of the British Empire.
-   Analysis: No specific time frame was given and also it was the British government to decode the nature and timing of advance.

###### MONTAGU CHELMSFORD REFORM OR GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ACT 1919:

-   It divided subjects into two categories i.e. reserved subjects like finance land revenue, law and order, etc;
-   And transferred subjects like health, education, agriculture, industry, local government, etc.

-   He spent his first year touring all over India and organising **SABARMATI ASHRAM** in **AHMADABAD**.
-   He did not believe in the methods of Home Rule Leaders and further commented that he would join any organisation to affect its policy and not to be affected by it.

### CHAMPARAN ISSUE - GANDHI'S FIRST CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IN INDIA

-   In **CHAMPARAN**, European planters involved the cultivators in an agreement that forced them to cultivate Indigo on 3/20th of their landholding (**TINKATHIA SYSTEM**).
-   At the end of the 19th Century, German synthetic dies completely forced out Indigo from the market.
-   European planters were keen to release the cultivators from the obligation but they turned their necessity into an advantage by taking advance rents and illegal dues for the price of release.
-   On this issue, a peasant leader **RAJKUMAR SHUKLA** persuaded **GANDHIJI**.
-   On reaching **CHAMPARAN**, **GANDHI** disobeyed the order of the district magistrate to immediately leave the district.

-   The issue at **AHMEDABAD** was the plague bonus that was given to the workers was to be withdrawn.
-   Moreover, in the aftermath of **WORLD WAR-I** cost of living increased which forced workers to demand an increase in wages and continuation of plague bonus.
-   Initially, the mill owners were not ready for it as such **GANDHI** intervened and tried to convince mill owners including **AMBALAL SARABHAI** to submit the issue to the tribunal which will decide the case.
-   But later the mill owners refused to do so. In this situation, **GANDHI** decided to observe a hunger strike to keep the motivation of workers high.
-   Finally, mill owners agreed to submit the entire issue to the tribunal which later awarded a 35% increase in the wages of the workers.
-   Sister of **AMBALAL SARABHAI**, **ANUSUYA BEHAN** was one of the ardent supporters of **GANDHI** in this case.

### KHEDA ISSUE - NO TAX CAMPAIGN - 1918

-   At **KHEDA**, the issue was a crop failure due to which the peasants demanded remission of land revenue.
-   Earlier the **SERVANT SOCIETY OF INDIA** (**GOPAL KRISHNA GOKHALE**) justified the case.

-   He advised peasants to withhold revenue and fight unto death against such an evil system.
-   He further commented that it is impossible to govern men without their consent.
-   In **GUJRAT**, **GANDHI** was supported by Young Lawyers from **KHEDA** i.e. **SARDAR PATEL**, **INDULAL YAGNIK**, **VITHALBHAI PATEL** with whom he toured the villages.
-   When the situation was going out of proportion, Government gave a secret instruction whereby it suspended the collection of land revenue and quoted that those who can afford to pay can pay the amount.

### ROWLATT BILL AND SATYAGRAHA:

-   It was named after the person who chaired the committee of bills.
-   The timing of these bills was not suitable when Indians were expecting substantial constitutional concessions after the end of **WORLD WAR-I**.
-   In February 1919, it was introduced which was aimed at curtailing the Civil Liberties of Indians in the name of curbing terrorist violence.
-   At this moment, **GANDHI** stepped in and suggested **SATYAGRAHA**.
-   Young Home Rule leaguers also joined the **ROWLATT SATYAGRAHA**.
-   The form of protest was nationwide hartal, fasting and prayers.
-   It was decided that 6th of April, the movement will be launched but due to some confusion, the public resorted to violence particularly in **DELHI**, **LAHORE** and **AMRITSAR**.
-   As such on the 10th of April, two local leaders **SAIFUDDIN KITCHLEW** and **SATYAPAL** were arrested by the British authorities which led to an attack on townhall, post office and telegraph services.

-   After War, **KHALIFA** was removed from power.
-   Muslims from India demanded that the **KHALIFA'S** control over Muslim sacred places must be restored.
-   And **KHALIFA** should be left with sufficient territories after territorial arrangement.

#### DEVELOPMENT OF KHILAFAT & NON-CO-OPERATION PROGRAMME:

-   In November 1919, the **ALL INDIA KHILAFAT CONFERENCE** was held in **DELHI**.
-   **GANDHIJI** was the president of this assembly.
-   He felt that this platform can be used for uniting the people of India i.e. Hindus and Muslims against the British authorities.
-   Moreover, there were many factors at this point in time that were favouring the launch of a mass movement.
-   People wanted rectification of **PUNJAB** wrongs and were highly raged with the actions in the House of Lords, Britain.

-   A special session of the **INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS** (**INC**) was held at **CALCUTTA** at the request of **GANDHI** presided by **LALA LAJPAT RAI**.
-   **GANDHIJI** made a big statement that if **NCM** is launched then **SWARAJ** could be achieved within a year.
-   **CR DAS** immediately rejected his statement and moreover some of the proposals were opposed by **ANNIE BESANT**, **MADAM MOHAN MALVIYA** and **LALA LAJPAT RAI**.

#### DEVELOPMENTS DURING NCM:

-   Boycott of educational institute, judiciary, foreign articles, etc was very successful.
-   Some of the nationalists like **RAJENDRA PRASAD**, **C RAJAGOPALACHARI**, **SARDAR PATEL**, **ASAF ALI**, etc left the profession of law.
-   To impart education on the Indian model foundation of **KASHI VIDYAPEETH**, **GUJRAT VIDYAPEETH**, **BIHAR VIDYAPEETH** and **JAMIA MILIA ISLAMIA** happened.
-   During the course of **NCM**, **TILAK SWARAJ FUND** was created, within few months One Crore rupee was collected in this fund.
-   **CHARKHA** was distributed among the masses as a symbol of nationalism.
-   Travel of **PRINCE OF WALES** to India was opposed which led to violence.
-   **MADAN MOHAN MALVIYA** tried to conciliate between Congress and the Government.
-   As a result, a talk was facilitated between **VICEROY READING** and **GANDHI**.
-   Viceroy proposed to convene Round Table Conference but **GANDHI** maintained that first British must release all the political prisoners of **KHAILAFAT ANDOLAN** and **NCM**.
-   Viceroy refused to do so and the talks failed.
-   On 1st of February, 1922 **GANDHI** challenged that if all the political prisoners are not released within 7 days then he will start Civil Disobedience from **SURAT BARDOLI**.
-   On the 5th of February, some policemen stopped the protesting masses in **CHAURI CHAURA** of **GORAKHPUR DISTRICT** in Eastern **UP**. In retaliation, the masses attacked the police station and they blazed fire as such all the policemen died.

#### THE STRATEGY OF STRUGGLE-TRUCE-STRUGGLE:

-   According to this strategy, **GANDHIJI** believed that masses cannot sacrifice endlessly.
-   So after every phase of mass struggle, a period of truce was to be followed for rejuvenation of the masses until they are again prepared for another mass movement.
-   The period of truce was to be utilised for constructive programmes that included to develop Hindu-Muslim unity, the emancipation of women, abolition of untouchability.

#### EVALUATION OF NON-CO-OPERATION AND KHILAFAT MOVEMENT

-   **KHILAFAT** question also lost its relevance and in November 1922 the people of Turkey rose under **MUSTAFA KEMAL PASHA**.
-   Deprived the sultan of its political powers and Turkey was made a secular state.
-   It was the first true mass movement of India.
-   **GANDHI** made the nationalists realise that the true power of the mass movement lies in Rural India rather than the urban places.
-   The creation of provincial congress committees on the basis of language further strengthened.
-   It streamlined the working of Congress as an organisation and a truly national party dedicated to national freedom.
-   There was tremendous participation of Muslims in the movement and in the entire duration there was complete communal harmony.
-   Large scale participation of Muslim masses was due to anti-imperial feeling.
-   But the nationalist leaders failed to convert this religious-political consciousness to a level of secular political consciousness.
-   Nationalist sentiments reached to every nook and corner of the country.
-   **CHARKHA** and **KHADI** became national symbols.
-   **Note**: At this point in time **MADAM ANNIE BESANT**, **MADAN MOHAN MALVIYA** and **MOHAMMAD ALI JINNAH** resigned from Congress.

### THE PHASE OF PRO-CHANGERS/SWARAJISTS AND NO-CHANGERS:

-   After the end of **NCM**, two types of ideological streams emerged within congress regarding the course of the national struggle.
-   Some leaders of Congress advocated using the provisions of the **GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ACT, 1919** and participate in the legislature.
-   They further suggested that nationalists should end the boycott of legislative councils, enter them and expose them as Sham parliament and obstruct every work of the council.
-   They further maintained that they were not giving up on Non-Co-operation but wanted to extend it to the councils.
-   The idea was proposed by **CR DAS** who was President of the **GAYA SESSION OF INC IN 1922**.
-   He was backed and supported by **MOTILAL NEHRU**.
-   The adherent of council entry programme came to be known as **PRO-CHANGERS**.
-   Another section of Congress including **VALLABHAI PATEL**, **RAJENDRA PRASAD**, **C RAJAGOPALACHARI** wanted to stick to the constructive programme advised by **GANDHI** and they opposed Council entry and came to be known as **NO-CHANGERS**.
-   On 1st of January 1923, **CR DAS** and **MOTILAL NEHRU**, **KHILAFAT SWARAJ PARTY** was created with **CR DAS** as its President and **MOTILAL NEHRU** as its secretary.
-   After this creation of the **SWARAJ PARTY**, the ghost of **SURAT SPLIT** started to haunt the ranks of nationalists.
-   Despite the ideological differences, both the factions were on common grounds at many points:
    -   Both were convinced that civil disobedience was not possible immediately.
    -   Both recognised, however important Council work may be, they can force British government only through the mass movement.
    -   Lastly, both the groups fully accepted the essentially of **GANDHI'S** leadership.
    -   In a special session at **DELHI** in 1923, Congress suspended all the propaganda against council entry.

#### GANDHI'S VIEW:

-   **GANDHI** was released from jail on the 5th of February 1924 on health grounds.
-   He was completely opposed to the council entry programme but later, he became accommodative and even while opposing them he respected them a lot.
-   Moreover, with their political work **SWARAJISTS** convinced **GANDHI** that they were not limbs of the imperialist force.
-   All things considered, **GANDHI** felt in any case council entry has happened and withdrawing it would be disastrous, an embarrassment to **SWARAJISTS** and it would be misunderstood as the weakness of Congress.

#### ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE SWARAJISTS:

-   In November 1923, elections to the legislative Councils were held.
-   They won 42 out of 101 elected seats in Central Legislative Assembly.

### SIMON COMMISSION

-   In 1919, the British government declared that **SIMON COMMISSION** also known as the **INDIAN STATUTORY COMMISSION** will be sent to India after 10 years to examine effects and suggest reforms of **GOI ACT, 1919**.
