![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज.png>)

### WHY STUDY SOCIETY

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 1.png>)

- To develop a perspective on the INDIAN SOCIAL SYSTEM (that would determine what is the solution you are proposing for the social issues and problems).
- To sensitize the governments/public officials on discourses of Society.
- To apply best practices of governance in the eradication of social problems.

### ANSWER

- Perspective - problem statement
- Body - multi dimensions of the problem statement, what can be done
- Solution - what is the best way to solve the problem.

### CONTENT (BROAD OUTLOOK)

#### SALIENT FEATURES OF INDIAN SOCIETY

##### DIVERSITY OF INDIA

- Linguistic diversity.
- Religious diversity.
- Regional diversity.
- Ethnic diversity.
- Racial diversity.
- Unity in diversity.
- Secularism.
- Collectivism
- Process of transition

##### MULTI-CULTURALISM: PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE CULTURES AND RELIGIONS

- INDIA is a land of diverse cultures.
- There exist peaceful coexistence of diverse cultures.
- People tend to retain, celebrate and transmit or pass the culture from one generation to another.
- There are 2 schools of thought concerning multiculturalism, that is **MELTING-POT** and **SALAD BOWL**.
    - **Melting pot**: People of different cultures melt together, deserting their cultures and getting fully assimilated within the predominated society. (एक राष्ट्रीय पहचान में क्षेत्रीय पहचान का मिल जाना और खो जाना)
        - E.g. USA
    - **Salad Bowl**: It describes a heterogeneous society where different cultures are brought together as the salad's ingredients. However, the individual flavor is retained. - this is mentioned to be promoted in the INDIAN CONSTITUTION.
        - E.g. INDIA

##### CULTURAL LAG

- It arises due to a difference in the pace at which the tangible and non-tangible aspects of culture change.
- ऐसे समझो कि समाज का value system बदलने में ज़्यादा वक़्त लगता है tangible (like technology, physical aspects of art etc) aspect से.
- It is believed that social problems and conflicts are caused because of this lag.

### EFFECT OF GLOBALIZATION ON INDIAN SOCIETY

- Effects on the structure-sections and institution.
- Effect on **Culture** - Homogenization, Hybridization, a revival of local culture.
    - Structure
        1. Sections

            2. Old age
            3. Youth
            4. PwD
            5. Child

            4. Media
    - Culture
        1. Homogenization
        2. Hybridization
        3. Revival of local culture

#### EXAMPLE OF HOMOGENIZATION

- McDonaldization of food habits
- Obsession with English language

#### HYBRIDIZATION

- Local + Global culture.
- Global culture taking local flavour for more social acceptability and extending its reach.
- Revival when international culture overtakes the aspects of local culture.
- Examples
    - Clothing - jeans and kurta
    - Language - Hinglish
    - Cuisines - pizza burger, INDIA chinese!

- _3 aspects of a problem_
    - _Political empowerment_
    - _Economic empowerment_
    - _Social empowerment_

#### SOCIAL EMPOWERMENT

- It refers to autonomy in decision-making and confidence to bring about changes in the structures which has kept us marginalized over a period of time.
- In the absence of social empowerment, economic and political empowerment are meaning less.

## SOCIETY

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 3.png>)

1.  CONCEPT
    - Based on the pattern of interaction we tend to develop social relationships (teacher-student, work colleagues, friends, relatives etc.)

2.  BASIC ATTRIBUTES
    - Definite territory
    - Progeny (major source of membership of any society is through reproduction)
    - Common culture
    - Independent existence

3.  IMPACT OF BRITISH RULE

4.  SALIENT FEATURES
    - Joint family
    - Caste system
    - Patriarchy

- A network of social relations based on patterns of interaction among the members is referred to as a **society**.

- Based on the four basic attributes we can conclude that INDIAN society is a collection of multiple societies (it has a composite culture)

### IMPACTS OF BRITISH ROLE ON INDIAN SOCIETY

| | | |
|---|---|---|
|**Traditional**|**Forces of change**|**Modern**|
|- **Status**: The status that we acquire by birth. For example, based on gender, based on caste, etc is **Ritual status** and The status we achieve in our society based on our achievements is called **secular status** (achieved status).<br>- **Hierarchy** (its opposite is **egalitarianism**)<br>- **Strong religious orientation**: when religion is not only a matter of faith but governs social, political, and economic cultures of life. (Opposite of this is **Rationality**)<br>- **Collectivism** (Opposite to **individualism**)<br>- **Particularism**: It is characterized by "You show me the man, I show you the rule" (आदमी देख के बात अलग अलग प्रकार से बात होती है), Circumstances dictates how ideas and practices are applied i.e. Some people are more equal than others. (Its opposite is **universalism**)|- **New social change**:<br>    1. Secular education.<br>    2. English language.<br>    3. Printing technology.<br>    4. Transport and communication.<br><br>-> Dissemination of Ideas<br><br>- **New social order**:<br>    1. Industrialization<br>    2. Urbanization.<br>    3. New indicators of social status<br><br>-> New elites class. (with secular status)|- **Secular basis of status**.<br>- **Egalitarianism**<br>- **Rationality**: is driven by scientific factors, logic, and facts.<br>- **Industrialization**.<br>- **Universalism**: Everyone is equal and treated the same, that is ideas and practices can be applied everywhere without modification.|

- Urbanization which is driven by the principle of **urbanism** has 2 aspects:
    - Heterogeneity
    - Anonymity

### WESTERNIZATION AND MODERNIZATION

- It was believed that with the forces of change INDIAN society would become modernized.
- However, what has been witnessed in the context of INDIA is **westernization**.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
|**Parameter**|**Westernization**|**Modernization**|
|- Definition<br>- Scope<br>- Extent in the society.|- Refers to a blind imitation of the culture of the west.<br>- The scope of westernization is limited to clothes, food habits, music preferences, etc.<br>- The extent of westernization is limited to the elite section of society (Upper and middle class)|- Refers to a progressive transformation of social, political, economic, and attitudinal aspects of life.<br>- Modernization is the fundamental concept that aims to bring about **changes in values, attitudes, infrastructure,** etc. For example industrialization, urbanization, the modern education system, etc.<br>- Modernization is **a mass affair** that penetrates every section of society.|

#### OBSERVATIONS

- Westernization per se is not wrong however in the name of modernization, restricting only to westernization is definitely wrong.
- Both Modernization and tradition (good and positive) can co-exist.
- Modernization is against only those values which are regressive in nature.

## SOCIETY CLASS 02

### JOINT FAMILY

- _Concept_

#### DEFINITION

- **Family** is defined as a social group consisting of people united by ties of blood, and marriage and adoption.
- According to G.P. MURDOCK, Family performs the following functions - common residence, economic cooperation, reproduction and sexual gratification.
- When the family extends to 2 or more generations, it is known as a **joint family**.

- _Types_

#### ON THE BASIS OF

- Marriage
    - **Sologamy** (It refers to self-marriage (the act of self-love) )
        - Although this marriage has no legal sanction, it is a symbolic ceremony to emphasize self-love and independence.
    - **Monogamy** (straight (one partner for life, no remarriage after death of a partner) and serial)
    - **Polygamy** (polygyny and polyandry (1W and MH example khasa tribe in HP, UK and toda tribe of TN))
- Residence
    - **Patrilocal**: wife husband के घर जाती है
    - **Matrilocal**: wife stays at her own place and husband might visit her at her place. (gharo, khasi, naayars tribe)
    - **Neo-local**: husband and wife living to a 3rd place (impact of globalisation)
- Ancestry
    - **Patrilineal** - lineage from the father's side.
    - **Matrilineal** - lineage from mothers' side (example: GARO, KHASI tribe of MEGHALAYA)
- Composition

##### IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION ON MARRIAGE

- Globalization has led to secularisation, which led to a decline in the social significance of religion.
- Marriage is no longer considered sacred, and the de-stigmatization of divorce and separation.
- Due to globalization we are moving straight to serial monogamy.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 4.png>)

- We are moving from patrilocal to neolocal.
- According to ECONOMIC SURVEY 2017-18, the child sex ratio is skewed in the favour of the boy child, due to patrilineal and patrilocal families.

- _Features of typical joint family._

#### INDIAN JOINT FAMILY

- Patrilineal
- Patrilocal
- Common sharing of property
- Commensality (Inter-dining)
- Blood relations (more important than marital relations)
- Power is centralized in the hand of the oldest male member
- Common residence
- Age and sex are the main ordering principles of the family hierarchy

#### FUNCTIONS AND DYSFUNCTIONS OF FAMILY

| | |
|---|---|
|**Functions**|**Dysfunctions**|
|- **Primary Socialisation**: i.e. early induction of child into the society's culture.<br>- **Agency of social control**: the elders in the joint family keeps a check on the children and prevent them from performing a deviant act.<br>- **Agency of social Insurance**: from each, according to their ability and to each according to their need.<br>- **Economic cooperation**: prevents fragmentation of assets and secures economy of expenditure.(खर्चा कम होता है)<br>- **Source of Identity**: Family provides the emotional and social support which acts as basis for identity formation of an individual.<br>- **Value system**: Cooperation, collectivism, delayed gratification|- Lack of privacy<br>- Lack of individualism<br>- Low status of women<br>- High fertility rate<br>- Disguised unemployment<br>- **Self-alienation**: It refers to detachment from oneself. Family is considered as a nexus where each member is concerned about what others are thinking, feeling, or doing.<br><br>This nexus demands mutual concern and attention. It is believed that this process restricts the development of the self and results in alienation.<br><br>- **Reproduction of social labour**: In a joint family set up children learn to conform and submit to authority, hence it leads to the creation of a submissive workforce.<br>- **Us vs Them (Ghettoization)**: Ghetto is an area that is populated largely by members of a particular community and ghettoization (choudhrization of garoth) is the process that leads to it. (It can be due to social, cultural, and economic reasons).<br><br>The members of the joint family live in a family ghetto and they see the word in terms of Us vs Them.<br><br>- Competition, individualism, immediate gratification|

- Arena of conflict and contradiction: the value system not in sink with each other like cooperation vs competition, collectiveness vs individualism, delayed gratification vs immediate gratification.

- _The life cycle of the joint family_

- **DISINTEGRATION (JF -> NF)**
    - **Migration**
        1. **Push**
            1. Agriculture distress
            2. Population pressure on land is increasing
            3. Decline in Village industry
            4. Lack of alternative means of livelihood
            5. Lack of basic infrastructure
        2. **Pull**
            1. Industrialization
            2. Globalization
            3. Urbanization
            4. Better opportunity and status for women
            5. Better infrastructure wrt health, education, skill development
            6. Better standard of living
    - **Land reforms and their impact:**
        1. Means to evade land ceiling laws
        2. Legal provision reduces dependence on family for financial reasons

- **REINTEGRATION (NF -> JF)**
    - Chain Migration: High cost of living + lack of ability to afford separate houses.
    - Child rearing in dual-carrier families.
    - Functional jointness is still retained due to the performance of physical and financial obligations. The family still retains joint family ethics for example participation in functions and ceremonies, hence we can say that in some cases joint households are getting disintegrated rather than the joint family.
    - Industrialization: provides a financial basis to sustain a joint family
    - Feeling of nativism
    - Counter migration: due to lack of ability to economically sustain in destination areas, results in counter-migration.

## SOCIETY CLASS 03

- _Emergent forms of the family_

- **Nuclear family with extended ties**
- **Single Parent Family:**
    - Reasons-
        - Globalization
        - Secularisation
        - Marriage is seen no more as a sacred institution
        - Divorce is no more a taboo
        - Feminization of old age
        - Premarital sex is seen no longer a taboo for some
        - Economic independence of women
        - Surrogacy
- **Female-headed Household**
    - **Male-specific distress migration**
    - **Sologamy**
    - **With the change in the value system, the universality of marriage is getting questioned**
- **Co habitation or Live-in -**
    - it is emerging as a threat to the institution of marriage as due to legal stringency and social stigma people don't want to go through the divorce process
- **Dual carrier family -** both husband and wife are working
- **Conjugal symmetrical family -** both have equal status in a marital relation

- _Impact of Globalization on Joint Family_
    - Structure
    - Functions
    - Interpersonal relationships

- **STRUCTURE -**
    - The disintegration of the Joint family
    - The disintegration of Joint household and not family
    - Emergent forms of family

- **FUNCTIONS -**
    - Initially, the family was both units of procreation and consumption
    - But with Globalization --> Industrialisation --> Factory system of Production --> Family reduced to the unit of consumption.
    - Educational role of family is reduced due to diverse job opportunities and the specialised institution of knowledge.
    - The emergence of technology and media has reduced the role of the family in spouse selection.
    - However, the role of primary socialization and agency of social control (adult personality stabilization - जवानी में बकचोदी से बचाव) is still performed by joint family.
    - The role of the family has become important in the backdrop of the growing old age population (By 2050 20% of the population will be in the old age bracket)
    - **Longevity Dividend** - Economic growth potential is created due to an increase in life expectancy

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 5.png>)

- **INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS -**
    - Democratic decision making.
    - The status of women is improving.
    - Social media --> Ties with family members improving.
    - Due to disintegration -> Decline in social support -> Aggravated mental health issues -> Has increased the vulnerability (old age, youth, adolescence, the person with a disability etc)

    - Role of caste in politics
    - Contemporary issues-
        1. Reservation
        2. Dalit Capitalism
        3. Violence against Dalit

### CONCEPT OF THE CASTE SYSTEM

- **Caste system** refers to a system of social stratification consisting of hierarchically arranged, closed, endogamous strata where membership is ascriptive, contact is restricted and mobility is theoretically impossible.
- **Stratification** - It refers to the ranking of the group in a hierarchy based on the unequal distribution of societal rewards such as Social, Political, and Economic.

### MODELS OF THE CASTE SYSTEM

- **Varna** -
    - It is a Book view
    - Theoretical support -
        1. **Guna theory** - satvik, rajas, tamas
        2. **Divine origin theory** (in RIG VEDA)
        3. **Racial theory** - ARYA, DASA
    - PAN INDIA framework

    - It is Field view
    - Existing in reality
    - Based on purity and pollution

    - Occupational division of labour
    - Flexible
    - Localized
    - Has two types of hierarchy -
        1. Ritual
        2. Secular

### FEATURES OF THE CASTE SYSTEM

- Innate nature - you born and die in the same caste
- Hierarchy
- Endogamy
- Commensality (You are not allowed to interdine with people belonging to lower caste)
- Occupational division of labour - Occupation is predetermined by birth and every caste is supposed to treat their occupation as a religious duty
- Disability and Privileges
- Caste councils (to ensure that caste rules are strictly observed).
- The objective is to maintain the unity of caste and secure the uniformity of rules

### TRANSFORMATION OF THE CASTE SYSTEM

- **Traditional -**
    - Hierarchy
    - Separation of contact
    - Occupational division
- **Forces of change -**
    - Industrialization
    - Urbanization
    - Modern value system
    - Role of state -
        1. Reservation
        2. Land reforms
        3. MANDAL COMMISSION
- **Contemporary Reality -**
    - Caste-neutral job opportunities
    - Urbanism - Heterogeneity & Anonymity -> Secular pattern of living
    - Rationality

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 8.png>)

#### ROLE OF STATE

##### RESERVATION

- With the reservation policy, the lower caste people got access to higher education, govt jobs, and political participation thereby improving their secular status in the society
- However, the opportunities were not equally reaped by all which led to the emergence of class within the caste

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 9.png>)

##### LAND REFORMS

- With the emergence of land reforms there emerged a section who irrespective of their status in the traditional caste hierarchy became socially dominant due to land ownership, numerical strength, and political power.
- (zamindars, rich & middle class peasants, small peasants, tenants, sharecropper, labour)
- They are referred to as **dominant caste** due to large land ownerships.

- Perspective of M.N. SRINIVASAN in below diagram :-

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 10.png>)

##### MANDAL COMMISSION

- With this, there was an alteration in caste structure where instead of vertical arrangement with stigma there was a horizontal competition for backwardness without any stigma
- Caste has been **dislodged from the ritual domain** however has **entered the psyche of the people during electoral politics**
- What society obscures cinema reflects

#### ROLE OF CASTE IN POLITICS

- **Politics** - When the strategies that rule is based on caste, it is referred to as the role of caste in politics

##### PRE-INDEPENDENCE

- Christian missionaries spread the message of Christianity as a reformatory movement against regressive practices.
- E.g.: Language +English education
- The emergence of the educated elite group who questioned certain practices
- e.g.: Caste system etc.

##### POST-INDEPENDENCE

- The opportunities wrt education, and jobs during the British period were largely availed by the upper caste hence their position got consolidated in the socio-political-economic-cultural domain hence came to be known as the **entrenched caste**.
- In the post-independence period with land reforms, there was the emergence of **ascendant caste**.

##### 1ST PHASE

- Reflects the struggle between entrenched (ES) and ascendent (AS) caste (dominant caste) for power.

##### 2ND PHASE

- It was characterized by the mobilization of lower caste people on caste lines both by ES and AS.
- This is referred to as the **politicization of caste**.

##### 3RD PHASE

- It was predicted that with secular education caste neutral jobs formation of multi-caste alliances the rigid caste identities will cease to exist.
- However, what we witnessed in was **castisation of politics** that is the emergence of caste-based political parties
- E.g. BSP

#### CONTEMPORARY REALITY OF CASTE

- According to NFHS, only 12% of marriages are intercaste.
- According to BEZWADA WILSON - from 2016 to 2020 472 deaths by manual scavengers.
- Despite the 2013 Act recent govt survey by the MINISTRY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT, there are 66692 manual scavengers in INDIA.

- Gaps wrt Social Indicators-
    - According to the ALL INDIA SURVEY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION (MINISTRY OF EDUCATION) - GER = 27 (gross enrolment ratio but GER (lower caste) = 23.4
    - Social associations based on caste -
        - Caste-based matrimony
        - Educational society and DALIT SAHITYA etc
    - Economic Associations-
        - DICCI (DALIT INDIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY)
        - NSCFDC (NATIONAL SCHEDULED CASTE FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL)
    - Political Association
        - Pressure groups
        - HARIJAN SEVAK SANGH
        - BAHUJAN SAMAJ PARTY (BSP)

## SOCIETY CLASS 04

### CASTE SYSTEM IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS

- Kindly refer to the relevant diagram drawn by SMRITI MA'AM in the live class.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 11.png>)

### COUNTERARGUMENTS

- According to the study conducted by AMIT THORAT and OMKAR JOSHI, 30% of Urban households are practising untouchability.
- According to SATISH DESHPANDE, untouchability is practised through **Ghettoization** and separate utensils for serving foods & water.
- According to ACTIONAID NGO, In more than 25% of villages, lower caste people are not allowed to work on the agricultural land as casual labour and also suffer from wage discrimination.
- Since there are strict rules with respect to the exchange of food and water, people of upper caste were not purchasing the food products from the people of lower caste.

**Question**: The caste system is assuming new identities and associational forms. Hence it can not be eradicated in INDIA. Comment

**Question**: Has caste lost its relevance in understanding INDIAN society? Elaborate your answers with illustrations. (10 marks; CSE-2020)

## RESERVATION

### CONCEPT

- **Reservation policy** refers to a form of affirmative action whereby the percentage of seats is reserved for the people belonging to socially and educationally backward communities.

### RATIONALE

- It was introduced to ensure the equality of opportunity, correct the historical injustice and give effect to the redistributive agenda of the state.
- Distributive justice

| | |
|---|---|
|**For**|**Against**|
|- Meritocracy is meaningless without equality of opportunity.<br>- The political necessity to give representation to every section.<br>- It will provide an opportunity for upward mobility.<br>- It will reduce the gap between have's and have not's.<br>- It prevents social conflicts and will promote national cohesion.<br>- Breaking stereotypes with respect to people.<br>- Enabling the Development of "cultural capital".<br>- Better probability to reap benefits of demographic dividend.<br>- Women empowerment.<br>- Helps in achieving "**Substantive equality**".<br>- Ensure diversity in higher education of jobs.<br>- It ensures the transition from the informal to the formal labour market.|- Merit gets compromised.<br>- Not every section gets representation. - Class within the caste.<br>- Opportunities Restricted to few.<br>- Gaps between have's and have not's is Skewed (inter-caste; intra-caste).<br>- **Reverse discrimination**: It refers to the discrimination against members of a dominant group in the favour of minorities or the disadvantaged.<br>- Violence against people from the reserved category has increased.<br>- It further consolidates the caste identities.<br>- It creates a perverse incentive for others to claim reservation and backwardness.<br>- It provides a disincentive for potential candidates from non-reserved categories and it leads to the situation of brain drain.<br>- It further reinforces the stereotypes and aggravates the prejudiced bias towards people availing reservation.<br>- Feeling of relative deprivation.|

#### WAY FORWARD

- New social yardsticks to determine reservation. E.g.: **NALSA JUDGEMENT (2014)**, according to which transgenders are most deprived section of society and should be given reservation under OBC status.
- **M. NAGARAJ case** and **ZERNAIL case,** in both the cases the SC, has asked to introduce a creamy layer within SCs and STs. (Dereservation based on social mapping)
- **Capability** (human capital formation: accumulation of knowledge, skill, health over a period of time) approach of AMARTYA SEN.
- Overhauling of the education system (RTE in secondary education); quality of education (government schools) at par with private schools.
- The robust administrative system is to ensure the penetration of reservation benefits for different sections.
- Encourage the **culture of entrepreneurship** where youth is transformed from 'job seeker to job giver'.
    - E.g. STANDUP INDIA
- Make agriculture lucrative.
    - E.g. Food Processing
- M.S. SWAMINATHAN says "the future belongs to a nation with grains rather than a gun".

**Question**: To what extent is the reservation policy in INDIA acted as a tool for social empowerment.

### DALIT CAPITALISM

- **Concept**
- **Who coined the term**
- **Is it the panacea for Dalit problems?**

- When **capitalism** is seen as a tool for the emancipation of DALITS, it is referred to as "**Dalit capitalism**".
- In simple words, entrepreneurship and self-employment among DALITS are referred to as Dalit capitalism.
- The term has been coined by **CHANDRABHAN PRASAD**.
- It creates an opportunity for economic empowerment of DALITS and results in their upward social mobility.
- The government is also promoting "Dalit Capitalism".
- E.g.: DICCI, NSCFDC, STANDUP INDIA scheme.
- However, it might be one of the means for emancipation, however, it does not guarantee their empowerment due to the following reasons:
    - It does not change the existing social mindset with respect to caste rigidities.
    - Due to the restrictions with respect to opportunities, they may lack the cultural capital and hence not be able to reap the benefits of Dalit capitalism. Hence, the benefits will only be reaped by those who are already elite within the DALIT community which will further aggravate the divide.
    - It might create a situation where DALIT capitalists have to confront various challenges with respect to social and administrative respects.
    - It still lacks in ensuring the upliftment of the poorest of poor as it does not focus on self-respect, social exclusion, land alienation, etc.

- **Despite stringent legal provisions, Violence against Dalits is on the rise. Discuss.**

### VIOLENCE AGAINST DALIT

- According to the NCRB (NATIONAL CRIME REPORTS BUREAU) 2020, there was a 9.5% rise in violence against DALITS.
- Lack of awareness about the legal safeguards.
    - E.g.: Prevention of Atrocities Act.
- **Persistence of a rigid caste system** despite the efforts of the government to eradicate its discriminatory component.
- Lack of adequate representation of DALITS within administration and law enforcement agencies.
- **Lack of reporting** by DALITS since their livelihood depends upon the upper castes.
- According to **CHRISTOPHER JEFFERLOT,** the increased status of DALITS with respect to secular hierarchy acts as a threat to the hegemony of the forward caste which results in the feeling of deprivation leading to violence.
- Lack of strict implementation of existing provisions, poor conviction rate.
    - According to NCRB in 2020, out of 50216 cases, only 216 conviction rate was reported, The pendency case was very high. (systemic issues - justice delayed is justice denied)
- The process of **Sanskritization** when challenged by the upper/forward castes, it also results in violence against DALITS.
- Many do not report the act of discrimination as there is a lack of subjective realisation of objective reality and consider it as a matter of fate.
- There is a fear of retaliation.
- According to the APEX COURT, there have been incidences where the existing laws have been missed and the term was coined **new legal terrorism** where instead of these provisions as a shield they were used as a weapon to settle personal agenda/scores.
- Glorification of fringe elements also reduces the deterrence factor.
- Rigid rules with respect to **caste endogamy** when breached **result in honour killing/violence.**

## SOCIETY CLASS 05

## WOMEN ISSUES

<<45597_classroom_0_society_class_women_issues.pdf>>

### OVERVIEW

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 12.png>)

- **Concept of Gender**: Socially constructed aspect of differences between men and women.

#### MANIFESTATION OF GENDER

- **Individual:**
    1. Men and women.
- **Cultural**:
    1. Aspirations, desires, values, attitudes, behaviour
- **Structural**:
    1. Sexual division of labour (men-to earn livelihood, woman-take care of domestic chores)

### HOW GENDER STEREOTYPING IMPACTS THE SOCIAL POSITION OF WOMEN

- **Gender stereotyping** (irrational, generalised and overlooking individual differences) **and Social position:**
    - Caring & nurturing: It tries to justify Domestic division of labour, low wages for care work, don't question women if laws are violated.
    - Soft skills: **Pink Collared jobs** (Certain jobs are reserved for women in the market. E.g.: Reception, Nurse, Primary school teacher, secretary, HR etc).
    - Emotional rather than rational: **Glass Ceiling** (it refers to a transparent ceiling in every organization beyond which a woman is not promoted). However, in time of crisis woman is promoted to decision-making authority is promoted as the risk of failure is high (**Glass Cliff**).
    - Weak, passive and dependent: Violence against women.

- **ANDRE BETEILLE** says "Law determines the direction in which society should move. However, it is the culture which determines the direction in which society actually moves".

### PATRIARCHY

- It refers to the system of social structures and practices in which men oppress, exploit and discriminate against women.
- Although patriarchy refers to the domination of men, women equally place a significant role in perpetuating patriarchy. The concept is known as a **patriarchal bargain** (concept given by DENIZ KANDIYOTI)
- **Definition**: A woman bargains with patriarchy to support male dominance to gain protection, status, resources, and approval, inside the system that she considers she might lose outside the system.

- **Patriarchy** as a concept is not the constant and gender relation has changed over time and space.

- The nature of control and subjugation of women varies with respect to class, caste, religion, ethnicity, etc.
- Hence, we can say BRAHMINICAL patriarchy is different from DALIT patriarchy and also that is different from tribal patriarchy.

#### STRUCTURE (FAMILY, EDUCATION, MEDIA, SYMBOLISM, CASTE, RELIGION)

##### FAMILY

- The first lesson of patriarchy is learned at the family level.
- **E.g.:**
    - Boy child is considered as the inheritor whereas a girl child is considered as 'PARAYA DHAN'.
    - Since most of the families are patrilinear and patrilocal, it accords the low status to the girl child.
    - Primary socialisation with respect to the notions of gender stereotyping.

##### KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM

- Patriarchal construction of knowledge perpetuates patriarchal ideology and this is reflected in our education system and media.
- Objectification and commodification of women through media. E.g.: Advertisements.
- Education: Content, the attitude of the teachers and infrastructure.
- According to ASER (ANNUAL STATUS OF EDUCATION REPORT) (by NGO PRATHAM) at the secondary level, the dropout of girl students is also due to a lack of functional toilets.

- Large no of STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS) has underrepresentation of women.

##### SYMBOLISM

- A more subtle expression of patriarchy is through symbolism by creating a **self-sacrificing image of women**. Through ideological indoctrination, the notion of ideal womanhood is created.
- Certain images are created for **damsels in distress** image which is glorified through cinema.
- Cinema through its **sexiest content** also perpetuates patriarchy.

##### RELIGION

- The patriarchal construction of society is legitimized by religion and religious institutions.
- E.g.: Certain personal laws are biased against women.

##### CASTE

- Caste and gender are closely related and the sexuality of women is directly linked with the purity of caste.
- Hence, the caste system and caste endogamy retain the control over labour and sexuality of women.
- Hence, caste not only determines the social division of labour but also a **sexual division of labour.**
- The notion of **purity and pollution** has been extended to women.

### PATRIARCHY VIS-A-VIS WORK

- Based on Gender stereotypes (Domestic division of labour): Women confined to private space -> It was believed with the rise Female Labour Force Participation (notions of patriarchy getting challenged).
- However, instead of getting challenged, private patriarchy to public patriarchy:
    - Sexual Harassment at the workplace.
    - Dual burden
    - Glass ceiling
    - Wage gap
    - Pink collared jobs
    - Violence against women.

#### STRUCTURE OF ANSWER IN SOCIETY TEMPLATE

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 14.png>)

#### SECTORS (AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, SERVICE, INFORMAL)

##### WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE

- **Statistics/concept**:
    - As per OXFAM research, agriculture employs **80%** of all economically active women in INDIA.
    - It consists of **48%** self-employed farmers and **33%** agricultural labour.
    - According to the AGRICULTURE CENSUS, **14%** of land operational holdings are owned by women.
    - **80%** of the farm work and **90%** of dairy production work is done by women.
    - The wage disparity is as high as **35.8%**.
    - According to CORTEVA AGRI SCIENCE, **78%** of women in agriculture are subject to gender-based discrimination.

- **Feminization of agriculture (FoA)**:
    - A measurable increase in women's participation in the agricultural sector is referred to as the **feminization of agriculture**.

- **Economic cause**:
    - Since most farmers are small and marginal (to sustain the family income -> increased participation of women in agriculture).
    - Male-specific migration to urban areas and hence feminization of agriculture.
    - Cheap labour (wage gap is 35.8%).
    - Small and marginal farmers can not afford to hire labour on wages (depending upon the labour of women in the family) --> which leads to the feminization of agriculture.
    - Globalization created opportunities but are Limited to skilled workforce, woman due to patriarchy lacks the required skill.

- **Socio-cultural cause**:
    - Socio-cultural acceptance of working in the agriculture sector.
    - easy to manage Dual Burden.
    - Flexible labour (SURINDER S. JODHKA)
    - Feminization of Old-age.
    - Farmers suicide.

- **Politico-Administrative factors.**
    - NOTE: Kindly refer to the relevant diagram drawn by SMRITI MA'AM in the live class.

- **Government Initiatives:**
    - 15th October is celebrated as the farmers' day.
    - MAHILA KISHAN SHASHAKTI PARIYOJANA.
    - The government has also increased its focus on SELF HELP GROUPS to ensure sustainable livelihood for them.

- **Positives of the Feminization of Agriculture**:
    - It brings women to the public sphere.
    - It provides an opportunity to socialize.
    - It makes their labour visible and accounted for to some extent.
    - It ensures the development of skills and confidence.
    - It increases their bargaining power.
    - It reduces the incidences of child labour and creates opportunities for the nutritional development of children.
    - Cases of OPERATION FLOOD, SEWA (SELF EMPLOYED WOMEN ASSOCIATION), etc led to the development of leadership, financial dependency, child nourishment, etc.

- **Challenges**:
    - Lack of ownership of assets (E.g.: 14% of landholding owned by women).
    - Due to a lack of ownership -> Lack of collateral security -> lack of access to the formal credit system -> dependency on informal money lenders (very high interest rates) -> debt traps -> **Fem of poverty**
    - Wage Gap
    - Technological interventions are often not designed according to women farmers hence there is a lack of supportive infrastructure.
    - **78%** of women farmers face Gender discrimination.
    - Lack of autonomy with respect to decision-making on important issues such as marketing, crop selection, etc.
    - Lack of awareness of their rights and their entitlements.
    - Increased mechanization of agriculture has resulted in the concentration of women in menial jobs.
    - Lack of gender-sensitive nature of agricultural extension services.

- **Discuss the economic and socio-cultural factors responsible for the feminization of agriculture in INDIA. (CSE-2022; 10 marks)**
- **"Feminization of Agriculture has led to women empowerment." Critically analyse the statement with respect to INDIAN society.**

##### WOMEN EMPOWERMENT

- Government has started skilling of girls in non-traditional livelihood option under BETI BACHAO BETI PADHAO.

- According to the UNO, **Women empowerment** is a sense of self-worth, access to resources (socio-politico and economy), autonomy in decisions making, control over their reproductive lives, and ability to influence the direction of social change.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 15.png>)

## SOCIETY CLASS 06

### WOMEN IN INDUSTRIES AND SERVICES

#### STATISTICS (IMPORTANT FROM THE MAINS EXAM POINT OF VIEW)

- According to GENERAL ELECTRIC (G.E.) and AVATAR RESEARCH, in INDIA, women's participation in the manufacturing sector is 12%.
- According to the CONSULATE GENERAL OF SWEDEN in INDIA, women in the manufacturing sector are between 3% and 12%.
- According to INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION (ILO), in INDIA women in the manufacturing and services sector combined is less than 20%.

#### ANALYSIS OF THE STATISTICS

- Lack of awareness with respect to opportunities.
- Lack of women role models - according to DELOITTE, only 4.7 % of CEOs in INDIA are women.
- Lack of flexible working conditions, accessibility, safety and security Issues.
- Restricted mobility after marriage.
- **Socialization** for domestic chores.
- Lack of Investment in technical and vocational education.
- Despite the increase in female enrolment in higher education, it is not getting reflected in the manufacturing and services sector. This is due to -> Career break due to reproductive responsibility.

#### THE VICIOUS CYCLE

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 16.png>)

- Patriarchy reduces the development and growth avenues of women that causes women to stay deprived or be dependent on male members.
- This deprivation/dependence restricts access to education and skill development which causes fewer opportunities for formal employment.
- The women hence remain confined to the informal sector.
- Informal employment sees women getting paid less than minimum wages, less safe working conditions, no social security benefits, and severely restricted career progression.
- The social standing and bargaining power of such women remain stunted.

#### FEMALE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION (FLFP)

##### STATISTICS

- As per the GLOBAL GENDER GAP report by WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (WEF):
    - Female participation in the labour force is 22.3%.
    - WEF also says that the income earned by women is 1/5th of men.
    - The percentage of women in technical and professional roles is 29.2% (STEM)
    - 14.6 % of women are at the senior level and only 8.9 % are at the managerial level

##### CAUSES FOR DECLINE IN FLFP

- Increase in household income.
- Caste notions of purity and pollution extended to gender roles (UMA CHAKRAVARTI’S concept of BRAHMANICAL PATRIARCHY).
- **Feminization U-hypothesis**: Feminization U hypothesis suggests that initially, female labour force participation will reduce with increasing economic growth, but will ultimately increase as the economy grows and undergoes substantial structural changes.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 17.png>)

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 18.png>)

- Lack of investment in sectors that can readily absorb women like textiles, apparel, etc.
- **Lack of incentive** among women to work (dual work, glass ceiling, gender gap, accessibility, pink collared jobs, sexual harassment, lack of autonomy in decision making ability).
- Infrastructural constraints (lack of CCTVs, child care facilities, conducive work environment etc) at workplaces.
- Social constraints like socialization for domestic chores, rigid patriarchal setup, career break, gender stereotypes etc.
- Digital divide - A study says that only 21% of women in INDIA are internet users.
- So women have minimal participation in the gig and platform-based jobs.

- **In the context of recent global gender gap report, discuss the factors responsible for decline in FLFP in INDIA.**

- **In the backdrop of decline in FLFP analyse its implication in context of INDIAN society.**

- According to AZIM PREMJI UNIVERSITY STATE OF WORKING INDIA report - 7% of men have lost jobs post covid, whereas 47% of women have suffered permanent job loss after covid.
- According to MCKENZIE GLOBAL INSTITUTE, 12 million INDIAN women will lose jobs by 2030 due to automation.
- Since the passage of the MATERNITY BENEFIT ACT (AMENDMENT), 2017 the desirability of women in the reproductive age group has declined in the formal labour market.

##### EFFECTS OF LOW FLFP

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 19.png>)

- **On Women:**
    - Lack of opportunity for upward social mobility.
    - Lack of financial autonomy.
    - Lack of decision-making authority.
    - Lack of ability to influence the direction of social change.
    - Lack of identifying and embracing their own feelings that may cause **Self -Alienation.**
    - It can negatively impact the cognitive development of women, social participation and interpersonal skills.
- **On Family:**
    - Negatively impacts the standard of living
    - The lost income might decrease the standard of living of the family.
    - Perpetuation of patriarchy -> further leads to strengthening of stereotypes
- **On the Nation:**
    - It might cause a substantial part of the demographic dividend to turn into a demographic burden.
    - It comes with a large impact on economic growth- According to MCKINSEY, if FLFP gets equal to MLFP, then INDIAN GDP will increase by 60 %.
    - It will increase the incidences of social evils such as domestic violence, child marriage, dowry, etc.
    - Threatens the possibility of achieving the SDG5 (sustainable developmental goal)
- **On an International Level:**
    - It will threaten the prospects of INDIA emerging as a global power, as poor indicators of FLFP will severely dent our soft power.

#### WAGE GAP

- It refers to the situation where women are paid less than men for doing the same work.
- According to the online salary index MONSTER, the wage gap in INDIA is 20%.
- According to OECD, the wage gap in INDIA exists because:
    - Undervaluation of “care work”.
    - Lack of bargaining power among women.

#### UNPAID WORK

**According to ECONOMIC SURVEY:**

- 91.8% of women in INDIA between the ages of 15 and 59 participated in unpaid domestic work for household members in 2019, as compared to 20% of men.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 20.png>)

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 21.png>)

- Irrespective of the educational status of women, the time for unpaid work remains roughly the same.
- This indicates that domestic responsibilities are borne mainly by women, even if they have access to better education and employment opportunities.
- Up to 91% of INDIAN women in paid jobs are in the informal sector.

##### CAUSES OF MORE REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN UNPAID WORK

- The prevailing gender stereotype believes that women are by their very nature caring and nurturing.
- This results in the early socialization of most of the girls for domestic chores.
- Society continues to look down upon working women, especially those with irregular working hours.
- Women have limited access to formal sector jobs due to lesser educational opportunities.
- Restricted mobility after marriage.

##### IMPACT OF SKEWED INFORMAL PARTICIPATION ON WOMEN

- It causes time poverty and time stress and generates considerable opportunity costs.
- It prevents women from actively pursuing further education & employment opportunities, and raising their skill level.
- Discrimination in hiring and pay.
- Increase in gender hierarchies in the family.
- Deteriorates life quality due to issues like sleep deprivation, social inclusiveness, etc.
- Increased vulnerability to emergency events due to lack of social security cover.
- OXFAM research says - If all work of women gets monetized, it will be valued at around $ 10 trillion.

##### UNPAID DOMESTIC WORK MUST BE MONETIZED BECAUSE

- It will give more autonomy to women to spend.
- Research by ESTHER DUFLO on INDIAN panchayats suggests that women-headed panchayats see more inclusive and socially productive use of funds than the panchayats headed by men which focus more on economical gains.

##### UNPAID DOMESTIC WORK MUST NOT BE MONETIZED BECAUSE

- It will rob the activities done out of love of their essence.
- It might lead to even more exploitation in household works as there is no standardization for the value of a myriad of household chores done.

#### PATERNITY LEAVE

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 22.png>)

- It is a paid leave period reserved exclusively for the fathers during childbirth.
- There is no such legal provision in INDIA.
- ALL INDIA & CIVIL SERVICES RULES allow Central government employees with less than two surviving children 15 days of paternity leave.
- This also extends to adopted children and can be availed up to 6 months from the date of delivery or adoption.
- It is not mandatory for private organizations in INDIA, but some organizations have taken initiatives on their own:
    - ZOMATO INDIA provides 26 weeks of paid leave for new fathers.

- Some noteworthy international precedents include SWEDEN which has mandated 480 days of paid leave to be shared by both, with a minimum of 90 days by one partner.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 23.png>)

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 24.png>)

- Briefly discuss the potential of paternity leave to create gender equality in the labour market, also discuss the challenges associated.

## SOCIETY CLASS 07

### APPROACH TOWARDS ANY ACT

- We should be aware of the premises (background) of the act.
- The provisions of the act.
- The analysis (pros and cons) of the act.
- The way forward as per the cons.
- From the prelims point of view, only the provisions are important.
- While writing answers in the mains examination - the premises of the act can be the introduction, provisions of the act can be the main body and the way forward will be the conclusion.

### MATERNITY BENEFITS ACT (AMENDMENT) 2017

#### PROVISIONS OF THE ACT

- Paid leave of up to 26 weeks.
- It will be a conditional leave for up to two children only.
- It will be only for 12 weeks for the third child onwards.
- Creche facility in organizations with more than fifty employees, and four visits to the creche per day.
- It will cover only the formal sector.
- It can be availed 8 weeks before the expected date of delivery.
- The employer needs to inform the women employees about the provisions of the act.
- Even the adopting (child less then 3 months) and commissioning mothers (a biological mother who uses her egg to create an embryo implanted in another woman) can avail of 12 weeks of leave.

- **Critically analyse to what extent MBA 2017 will achieve its desired objective. (10m)**

#### PROS OF THE ACT

- Benefits to women in the formal sector.
- Income security.
- Early childhood care.
- Early socialization.
- Arrest the trend of a career break.
- It promotes small family norms as the 26-weeks paid leave is conditional only for the first two children.

#### CONS

- The benefits are not extended to the informal sector where the majority of the women work.
- The desirability of reproductive-age women in the labour market will decrease as they would be seen as incurring additional costs to the company.
- Even the INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION (ILO) advises only 14 weeks of paid maternity leave, so many perceive that 26 weeks is too much time when women remain out of touch with the labour market, and it can give rise to **structural unemployment**.
- It may aggravate the glass-ceiling effect and wage gap.
- Cost competitiveness of smaller enterprises.
- It might reinforce gender stereotypes of care role

#### THE WAY FORWARD

- Extending the benefits to the informal sector.
- **SWEDEN'S model** of 480 days of parental paid leave gets split between the parents, with a minimum of 90 days for each partner.
- **SINGAPORE** - 16 weeks of paid leave of which 8 weeks are borne by the company and 8 weeks are borne by the government.
- Introducing flexible work conditions like a hybrid model of working (work from home or from the office).
- Incentives to improve the desirability of pregnant women like through tax breaks.

### VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 25.png>)

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 26.png>)

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 27.png>)

- Any act of gender-based violence that results in physical, sexual, or mental harm is referred to as **violence against women**.
- It includes female infanticide, trafficking, dowry-related deaths, etc.
- NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR WOMEN (NCW) said a 46 % increase in violence against women in the first 8 months of 2021.
- NCW data says that UTTAR PRADESH reported most such incidents, followed by DELHI and HARYANA.
- It is estimated that **around 86% of the women did not seek help.**
- 77% of those women did not share the violence with anyone.
- Out of the remaining 14%, only 7% could reach a proper authority.

#### SHADOW PANDEMIC

- It is used to refer to the increased instances of domestic violence during the last pandemic.

#### CAUSES OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

- The institutionalization of patriarchy, by both men and women, causes the normalization of such incidents, as seen by the GENDER SOCIAL NORM INDEX by UNDP.
- The economical dependence of women accords them a subordinate status and perpetrators believe they can hence "get away" with violence.
- Some traditional cultural practices like Female Genital Mutilation.
- Situational factors: Drug abuse, Alcoholism, etc.
- The nuclear family setup along with the no-child policy of new-age couples often see women being treated as cushions to vent out frustration.
- Even working women face such abuse because there the male hegemony is threatened.
- Institutional weaknesses like a lack of stringent laws, robust implementation, gender sensitivity, poor conviction rates, etc.
- The lack of courage among women to report results in low deterrence against such actions.

##### GENDER SOCIAL NORMS INDEX 2020, BY UNDP, FOUND THAT

- 90 % of both men and women are biased against women.
- 50 % believed males are better political leaders.
- 40% of them believe men are better corporate executives.
- 28 % believe that it is fine for a husband to beat his wife.
- It covered 70 countries which combinedly had 80% of the global population

#### DESPITE INITIATIVES, VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (VAW) IS ON THE RISE BECAUSE

- Poor conviction rates.
- Delay in judicial proceedings.
- Lack of awareness among women with respect to their rights.
- Fear of stigmatization leads to a large number of cases not being reported.
- Lack of efforts for attitudinal change both by the government and society.
- The gender-biased attitude of the law enforcement agencies.
- Corruption of the value system.
- Failure of the state to provide adequate infrastructure.
- Lack of gender - segregated data.
- **Broken Window theory**: Most men and women while growing up normalize violence against women.

##### BROKEN WINDOW THEORY

- When we commit a small or petty offense at an early stage for which we are not reprimanded, the chances of committing a heinous offense at a later stage are very high.

#### THE IMPLICATIONS OF VAW

- **Health issues:**
    - VAW is a preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in women.
    - It affects the mental, physical and reproductive health of women.
- **Economic issues:**
    - The direct costs include the loss of income, productivity, health and the cost of healthcare.
    - Indirect effects on the upbringing of the child and intergenerational psychological costs.
- **Development issue:**
    - It obstructs the participation of women in development and policy making as it obstructs their ability to act more freely.
- **Rights issue:**
    - It hinders the realization of fundamental rights under articles 14 and 21 of the constitution.

#### SHORT-TERM WAY FORWARD

- Strict enforcement of laws.
- Quick disposal of cases through fast-track courts.
- Strict patrolling /vigilance at night.
- Training women in self-defence.
- Promote the concept of Community policing and Mohalla committees.
- Regulation of public transport (GPS CCTV cameras).
- Setting up helpline/mobile apps.
- Social innovations like ONE STOP CENTRES, MAHILA POLICE VOLUNTEERS (MPVs), OINK buses and autos, etc.
- Mechanisms to protect the privacy and dignity of the victim.
- Use of technology to create gender-friendly infrastructure and space (both physical and virtual).

#### THE LONG-TERM WAY FORWARD

- Moral overhauling of the society.
- Value-based education without any gender coloration.
- Gender - sensitization of all stakeholders.
- De-stigmatisation of VAW.
- Creating awareness among women through continuous efforts by using social media charismatic personalities, street plays, etc.
- Engage with men and boys as the agents of change, like the "HE FOR SHE" campaign.
- Psychological counselling and rehabilitation of victims
- Need for a convergence approach.

##### CONVERGENCE APPROACH

- It involves two aspects:
    - **Vertical convergence:**
        1. **National, state, District, and Local level cooperation and accountability.**
    - **Horizontal convergence:**
        1. **Joint efforts through laws, political will, infrastructure, funds, and societal awareness.**

- **Despite increase in legal provisions, violence against women is on the rise. Discuss**
- **Explain the paradox where increase violence against women justifies strong laws where as on the other hand this laws have been misused by some women.**

#### WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASING NUMBER OF FALSE CASES BECAUSE

- Lack of gender neutral laws.
- Seeking vendetta/Revenge vendetta.
- Unbalanced nature of the society so women seek monetary benefits.
- The secularisation of marriage - so divorce does not have the old taboo.
- Gender stereotyping - women are always weak, passive, and dependent.
- Corruption of value systems.
- The **way forward** must be **penalization** of misuse and not the dilution of the provisions.

#### DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

- According to the MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION, and the NATIONAL COMMISSION OF WOMEN, domestic violence has the largest share of the overall violence against women.
- As per the DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT 2005, domestic violence includes both the abuse and the threat of abuse which can be physical, verbal, emotional, sexual, or economic nature.
- The ambit of "woman" as per the act includes wife, mother, daughter, sister, live-in relationship partner, and divorced wife.
- The act is a **civil law,** and it becomes a criminal offense that is a cognizable and non-bailable offense only when the protection orders are breached.
- The case can be filed against men, women, and even children.

- **Despite dowry prohibition act the practice still persist in the society, explain the factors responsible.**

### DOWRY

- This is believed to be the most important reason behind sex-selective abortion, girl infanticide, lack of investment in the education of the girl child, domestic violence, and the overall skewed sex ratio.
- As per the DOWRY PROHIBITION ACT 1961, **dowry** includes any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given directly/indirectly by one party to a marriage to another.
- It does not include **Mahr** or **Streedhan** (Gifts given to a girl so as to meet her financial needs) and **Bride price** as practiced by some tribal communities like YANADI of ANDHRA PRADESH and BARIA, PADI, and DAMOR of GUJARAT.

#### SOME FEATURES OF THE DOWRY PROHIBITION ACT 1961

- Dowry is considered a cognizable offense for the purpose of investigation.
- Every offense under this act is non-bailable and non-compoundable.
- The burden of proof is on the accused.
- It makes the agreement for giving or taking dowry void.
- State governments must appoint Dowry Prohibition Officers.
- Punishment with imprisonment or fine or both for giving or taking or abetting the giving or taking of dowry, demanding dowry, and even advertisement related to dowry.

#### REASONS FOR RISING INCIDENCES OF DOWRY (FROM AROUND 40% IN THE 1930S TO AROUND 90% IN THE 2000S)

- Acceptance of the dowry culture both by men and women due to the fact that the hierarchical relationship between men and women is accepted by all.
- Increased **consumerist** culture.
- It is treated as an investment hoping for a **quid pro quo** in the future (more commonly for government servants).
- It is also identified with the concept of "groom price" which is determined as per the "market value" based on caste, future prospects, education, job, etc.
- **Sanskritization** with respect to the practice of dowry - lower castes/classes trying to emulate the practices of upper castes/classes after getting financially capable. This is also seen through increased instances of "Pre-Wedding photoshoots".
- The practice of caste endogamy causes a scarcity of grooms in certain areas which pushes up the dowry.
- It is associated with the social prestige of the family.

#### THE WAY FORWARD

- Promoting the concept of **Adarsh Marriage,** where affluent people restrain from lavish weddings.
- Stigmatization of the practice of dowry through naming and shaming, Mohalla committees, etc.
- Efforts to increase Female Labour Force Participation (FLFP).
- Use of **innovation-diffusion framework,** where key leaders and personalities would be persuaded to spread awareness.
- Outlawing extravagant weddings.

### SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF WOMEN AT WORKPLACE (PREVENTION, PROHIBITION AND REDRESSAL) ACT OF 2013

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 28.png>)

- Section 354 (a) of IPC defines sexual harassment as: “any one or more” of the following “unwelcome acts or behaviour” committed directly or by implication: physical contact and advances, a demand or request for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography, and any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature.

### MANIFESTATION OF DIVERSITY

#### LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY

- INDIA is extremely linguistically diverse and is often known for "**KOS KOS PAR BADLE PAANI CHAR KOS PAR VANNI**".
- Language is the most powerful instrument of cultural identity and has always remained a source of both cohesion and conflict.
- Often discourse has emerged due to feelings of relative deprivation and fear of domination by the majority of language speakers.
- The adoption of an official language was a debatable issue in the initial decades.
- English was sought/considered by some as a strong contender: Language of international diplomacy, Trade, and Commerce, Exposure to western thought, and A broad spectrum of academic work was available in the language.
- However according to MAHATMA GANDHI, "English will never be accepted as the official language due to unequal relations with Britishers".
- Under ARTICLE 343, Hindi in DEVANAGARI script will be the official language and English will be the associate official language till 1965.
- 1956 to 1960: During this time the Non-Hindi Speaking people started protesting and agitated against Hindi as the official language (it is an example of Supra-state regionalism).
- 1963: Official language Act was introduced to ensure the use of the English language beyond 1965, however, the text of the act was ambiguous and it generated apprehensions.
- 1967: Official Language Amendment Act was passed which ensured an indefinite policy of bilingualism.
- Post-1967, the problem gradually disappeared from the political scene demonstrating the capacity of the INDIAN political system to deal with the problem on a demographic basis and in a manner to promote national consolidation.

- NOTE: Important chapters of BIPIN CHANDRA (INDIA SINCE INDEPENDENCE): Chapters: 07, 08, 09, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24, 29, 30 and 31.

##### LINGUISTIC ORGANIZATION OF STATES

- RAJANI KOTHARI said, "linguistic reorganization was functional as it removed the major source of discord and created homogeneous political units which could be administered through a medium that vast majority understood."
- It was like opening PANDORA'S BOX as INDIA is a land of multiple linguistic cultures so even after linguistic reorganization, the demand for the state continues to persist.
    - E.g.: GORKHALAND, MITHILANCHAL, BHOJPUR, etc.
- The basis for the creation of small states was spilled over into other areas such as river water disputes, underdevelopment, administrative convenience, etc.
- However, overall it had removed a major factor affecting the cohesion of the country.

**Que**: Implementation of the language provision proved to be a formidable task in the initial decades after independence. (10 marks/150 words)

**Que**: Discuss to what extent linguistic reorganization of state has contributed to INDIAN unity? Discuss. (10 marks/150 words)

**Que**: Is communalism a threat to national integration? Discuss. (10 marks/150 words)

#### RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY

- **Extent**:
    - Inter-religious: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc.
    - Intra-religious: mode of worship
    - Issues with respect to relative diversity:
- **Communalism**:
    - Concept
    - Manifestation
    - Types
    - Evolution
- **Fundamentalism**:
    - Concept
    - Causes
- **Way forward**

##### COMMUNALISM

- It refers to an **ideology** according to which the society is **divided** into different religious communities having **different secular interests** (socio-economic and political interests).
- A **man** of **religion** is not communal but the one who practices **politics** by linking with religion can be termed as "**Communal**" (Political trade in religion).

###### MANIFESTATION OF COMMUNALISM

- There are **three phases** of communalism:
    - **Mild**:
        - When people belonging to the same religion have the same interests.
    - **Moderate**:
        - People belonging to different religious communities have different interests.
    - **Extreme**:
        - Not only different interests but **mutually hostile** or **antagonistic interests** (**Zero Sum Game Theory of Power**).
    - There exists a perception that the resources in society are limited and if someone's access to resources increases it is at the cost of others.
    - However, this is only a perception as the resources and opportunities can always be increased by promoting inclusive growth and development.

###### TYPES OF COMMUNALISM

- **Assimilationist** (आत्मसात् करना):
    - When a large religious community assimilates the smaller one within its fold, it is referred to as Assimilationist communalism, it is generally not considered as threat.
- **Welfarist:**
    - Efforts are involved in the social and economic upliftment of their community.
    - For example Employment opportunities, residential accommodation, scholarships, etc.
- **Retreatism:**
    - The members of the BAHAI community forbid their members to participate in political matters since it is based on the ideology of unity of God, religion, mankind, etc.
- **Retaliatory:**
    - Communities have mutually hostile interests and often it is manifested in the form of communal violence.
- **Separatist**:
    - The demand for autonomy on the basis of religion, however within the ambit of the INDIAN union.
    - However, the demand for a separate nation based on religion is referred to as secessionist communalism.
- **Secessionist:**
    - The demand for a separate nation based on religion is referred to as secessionist communalism.
- According to T.K. OOMMEN first 3 are not a threat to national integration but the last 3 are.

###### EVOLUTION OF COMMUNALISM

1.  The communal bickering did start before the emergence of British rule.
    - E.g.: Destruction of temples, forced conversions, imposition of taxes on religious practices of other religions, etc.
    - However, the region while it has persisted for so long, the genesis can be traced to the British period.
    - Stagnation of agriculture + Lack of modern industries + Limited opportunities for modern education **==>** Demand and aspirations of the middle class was not getting addressed as a discrepancy between demand and availability of opportunity => Groupism, nepotism => Sowed the seeds of communalism.

2.  The socio-economy reality of INDIA has been such that class distinction is connected with religious distinction class: Have's and Have's not.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 31.png>)

3.  Also the result of elite power struggle.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 32.png>)

4.  Divide and rule policy of the Britishers:
    - To counter the growing national movement, communalism became the main tool of colonialism.
    - For example Tolerance towards communal press plus separate electorate, the policy of favouring one community against others in government jobs, political positions, etc.
    - The overthrow of the colonial state is the only state that was only a necessary condition to fight communalism but not sufficient.

**Reasons:**

- The **failure** of **national leadership** to unify different sections of society was restricted to the policy of negotiation with leaders of different religious organizations.
- There was an implicit acceptance that they only share economic and political interests, however, they are socially and culturally different.
- Even in the post-independent period, the government failed to come to terms with communalism hence it has persisted for so long.
- Lack of **cultural integration** --> stereotype --> prejudice attitude --> Violent manifestation --> Target group resorting to technique of invisibility for survival --> Ghettoization --> Lack of cultural integration.
- Lack of adequate opportunities for socio-economic development.
- Perceive or real deprivation
- Divisive politics is making use of religious and cultural differences so as to serve their vested interest.
- Politics of appeasement. For e.g. Act passed by the government to overturn the SC judgment in the SHAH BANO judgment.
- Administrative failure with respect to tackling the situation of communal violence.
- Role of media: In the name of sensationalization and criminalization is also been the reason for increasing tensions between different groups.
- Social media: How in the name of anonymity it has become the medium for the spread of hate, radicalization of youths, in-groups, development of prejudices, etc.
- Lack of **mutual trust,** and **understanding** between the people of different communities.

## SOCIETY CLASS 09

**Que**. Communalism arises either due to power struggle or relative deprivation. Discuss (10 marks/150 words)

#### RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISM

- **Fundamentalism** refers to the belief in the strict adherence to ideology or principles.
    - Religious extremism
    - Rejection of modernity.
- **Concept-**
    - Tradition defended in the traditional way
    - Sometimes violent manifestation
    - However, in common sense understanding, it often used in negative connotations
- GABRIEL ALMOND - A violent offshoot of communalism, The visible pattern of religious militancy in which self-styled true believers try to arrest the erosion of religious identity.
- Rationale - Due to globalization, the world has changed so much that it has threatened the possibility of preserving and promoting the beliefs and practices

- **Causes-**
    - STEVE BRUCE says - There are two **necessary conditions** (but not sufficient) for the emergence of fundamentalism-
        - Modernisation
            1. Rational/Progressive transformation
        - Secularisation
            1. Differentiation
            2. Privatization
            3. The decline in the social significance of religion
    - In addition to these, there is also a need of (necessary condition but not sufficient) -
        - Ideological Cohesion => Having a single sacred text which makes it easier to mobilize people
        - Supply of Potential Recruits (Those who are Relatively deprived)
        - Charismatic Leadership => Example: HITLER
        - Communication (Technology) =>There is faster dissemination of ideas
        - Rational (+) Secular Education
        - Strong Civil Society (Counter Civil Society e.g. ISIS -> concept given by NEERA CHANDHOKE)

**Ques**. "Modernity is breeding religious fundamentalism". Critically analyse the statement.

##### WAY FORWARD: MEASURES TO TACKLE FUNDAMENTALISM

- Eradicating the problems of poverty, unemployment, and illiteracy.
- Value based on education without any ideological coloration
- Value of peace, nonviolence, cooperation, and development of scientific temper, needs to be instilled
- Reform in the criminal justice system, speedy trials, adequate compensation, increased representation of minorities in law enforcement agencies, training of forces in human rights
- Codified guidelines for administration, a specialized training module for police to handle communal riots
- Establishment of hotlines wrt complains in the context of communal conflicts
- Setting up of peace communities, responsible and restraint journalism, extremist communal outfits should be immediately targeted and their capacity to disrupt law and order must be crippled
- Active participation of NGOs and civil society to drive away the mistrust between different communities
- Cultural platforms should try to promote peace and harmony between different groups

#### REGIONAL DIVERSITY

- **Concept of Region-**
    - **Homogeneous area**
    - **Physically and culturally distinct from the neighbouring area**
    - **people living in the region have sufficient awareness that they are similar but distinct from others**
    - **development of regional identity**
    - **People start professing their political loyalties more towards the region rather than the state/country which it is a part of.**

**Ques**. In the context of diversity of INDIA, can it be said that region form the cultural units rather then states? Give reasons with examples.

- **Regionalism**

**Definition:**

- **Regionalism** is rooted in INDIA'S diversity wrt caste, religion, language, ethnicity, etc.
- When all these factors are geographically concentrated along with the feeling of relative deprivation

##### POLITICS OF REGIONALISM

- **Positive-**
    - If we intend to concretize our own identity (Linguistic reorganization of states)
    - If for purpose of socio-economic development (TELANGANA)
    - If for administrative convenience (UTTARAKHAND)
- **Negative-**
    - Resorting to violence
    - Secession (threat to the territorial integrity of country)
    - **Son of soil** - State constitutes the exclusive homeland of its main language speakers or local residents
        1. Example - KARNATAKA, MAHARASHTRA, HARYANA, ASSAM
        2. Factors responsible for Son of soil-
            i) Lack of culture of out-migration
            ii) Clash for middle-class jobs
            iii) Presence of strong regional parties
            iv) Failure of the state to accommodate the interest of both natives and migrants
            v) Due to rising aspirations anything short of expectations is met with resentment

##### LANDMARKS THAT LEAD TO THE EMERGENCE OF REGIONALISM

- **The democratic form of govt**
- **Linguistic Reorganisation of states**
- **Integration of princely states**
- **The selfish interest of the politician**

##### BASIS OF REGIONALISM

i) **Historical-**

- It supported regionalism on the basis of cultural heritage, folklore, myths, etc.
- for ex: demand for DRAVIDANADU (DRAVIDISTAN) was supported by the theory that DRAVIDIAN-speaking areas once had non-BRAHMINICAL polity which was destroyed by ARYAN conquests and hegemony.

ii) **Geographical-**

- Presence of natural resources, landforms, international borders, connectivity, climate, rainfall, buffer area, etc.
- Example - NORTHEAST --> Presence of CHICKEN NECK, 99% of its borders are international, PUNJAB and NORTHEAST - GOLDEN TRIANGLE and GOLDEN CRESCENT

iii) **Socio-cultural-**

- Language has been a most important mark of group identification hence giving rise to linguistic regionalism
- Example - Bifurcation of greater ASSAM
- Although there have been some demands based on caste and religion for example, in the context of TAMILNADU, and PUNJAB respectively, however, since these demands were considered a threat to the secular fabric of INDIA they were presented in the garb (veil) of linguistic demands

iv) **Politico-Admistrative-**

- Politics do not create regionalism, it accentuates (आग में घी डालना) regionalism. It takes advantage of the situation of regional discontent and converts it in their favour so as to strengthen their vote bank

v) **Economic -**

- It is the crux of regional politics. It is based on the fact that resources are limited and demands are disproportionate
- The govt. policies since independence have failed to address regional disparities and instead aggravated the regional inequality and economic differences.
- Due to the unequal distribution of development benefits, there has been a demand for smaller states
- Example - Despite being rich in natural resources some regions remain underdeveloped like NORTH EAST.
- TELANGANA did accuse ANDHRA of colonizing their region, by grabbing their jobs, land, and govt not investing n their infrastructure, opportunities, etc.

**Ques**. What is the basis of regionalism? Is economic inequality is the most important factor behind regionalism?

##### TYPES OF REGIONALISM

i) **Inter-state-**

- Inter state River water disputes
- Border Issues-Despite between PUNJAB and HARYANA over CHANDIGARH

ii) **Intrastate-Sub-regionalism-**

- BODOLAND
- GORKHA LAND
- VIDHARBHA
- SAURASHTRA

iii) **Demand for secession**

- GREATER NAGALIM
- KHALISTAN

iv) **Supra - state-**

- NORTH INDIAN states vs SOUTH INDIAN states on the issue of regionalism

##### IMPACT OF REGIONALISM

**Positive:**

- It plays an important role in nation-building if it accommodates national feelings
- By accepting the demands it gives the right of self-determination to the people
- not always the regional interest is pitted against national interest, in fact, sometimes it ensures better integration of people in overall governance
- It helps in keeping political extremism at bay
- It helps in realizing the salad bowl theory of multiculturalism in the true sense

**Negative:**

- It can be seen as a threat to overall development and unity especially when it has violent overtones
- It acts as a source of internal security challenges
- It has become a tool in hands of politicians to serve their vested interest (Vote bank politics)
- It may also hinder international diplomacy (Role of INDIA in SRI LANKAN civil war)
- Unequal distribution of resources due to the presence of strong regional leaders also leads to relative deprivation
- Sometimes when it has secessionist tendencies it threatens the territorial integrity

**Que**. Growing feeling of regionalism is a necessary condition for the demand of separate states. Discuss

**Que**. Do you agree that regionalism in INDIA appears to be a consequence of rising cultural assertiveness? Argue.

**Conclusion template :::**

**Regionalism** is likely to happen in INDIA because it is rooted in INDIA'S diversity, per se it is not a threat to INDIA'S Unity and integration. It becomes an threat only when it takes form of violence and secessionist tendency.

## SOCIETY CLASS 10

### RACIAL INTOLERANCE

- **The concept of Race** = is defined as a social group consisting of people having distinct physical traits, for e.g. skin colour, facial features, etc.
- **Causes of Racial Intolerance**
    1. Lack of Cultural integration
    2. Stereotyping => Prejudices
    3. Obsession with fair complexion
    4. Discrepancy between demand + supply/availability of resources
    5. Anti-Social elements which put one group against another using a zero-sum game theory of power
    6. Racially biased attitude among some officials
    7. Cultural Chauvinism
    8. Stereotype is further enforced through cultural platform (e.g. media, cinema, etc.)
    9. Lack of deterrence (poor conviction rate, judicial delays)
    *When Primordial identities plays more then desired role.

- **Implication**
    1. **At the Individual Level** - lack of life with dignity, limited access to resources, lack of availability of opportunities for social morality, self-alienation (anxiety, depression), radicalization, lack of confidence, insecurity, and feeling of relative deprivation lead to an increase in crime, work efficiency and motivation to work is impacted.
    2. **At the societal Level** - High potential for social conflict, and a lack of development of social capital, threatening the prospects of unity and diversity, development of hate among communities, skewed migration, ghettoization.
    3. **At National Level** - hampers bilateral relations, Threatens the prospects of INDIA to emerge as an education tourism hub and global power, negatively impacts the potential of demographic dividend, and threatens territorial integrity due to the possibility of secessionism tendencies, supra-state regionalism, etc.

- **Way Forward =**
    - There should be a sensitization program that focuses on INDIA'S Obsession with a particular race. (to spread awareness regarding the racial discrimination and it’s ill effect)
    - Charismatic personalities should come forward to voice against the practice of racism,
    - Police seeds to be trained and sensitized wrt racial attacks
    - Educational institutions need to be more accommodative and inclusive,
    - Holding workshops by the govt or civil society to sensitize locals about the culture of racial minorities
    - Different agencies of socialization should inculcate neutral values, and compassion, towards racial minorities.

##### BEZBARUAH COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

- Stringent laws are the need of the hour.
- Establishment of fast track courts for speedy disposal of cases.
- An educational intervention to bring about change in the attitude wrt minorities.
- Making use of social media to create awareness in the society.
- Provide legal awareness to racial minorities wrt a grievance redressal mechanism.
- Bonding power over sports should be explored.
- Confidence-building measures should be taken to assure racial minorities about their security and well-being in INDIA.

**Question** - In the backdrop of growing incidences of racial intolerance briefly discuss its implication in the context of INDIAN society? (10 marks)

#### ETHNO-NATIONALISM

- **Ethnic Group** = is defined as a social group consisting of people united by ties of common history, ancestry, common culture, etc.
- People of an ethnic group have awareness of their similarities and how they are distinct from others which leads to the development of Ethnic identity, differential access to resources based on ethnic identity which leads to ethnic stratification -> Ethnic antagonism -> with the subjective realization of objective reality leads to Ethno-nationalism.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 33.png>)

- According to ERICSON Ethnic groups are defined as, those who consider themselves culturally distinct and such groups may exist in hierarchical order in society.
- SANJIB BARUAH wrote in 'INDIA AGAINST ITSELF' ASSAM AND ITS POLITICS OF NATIONALISM - he discussed the reasons for the emergence of demand for BODOLAND. - The increased presence of BENGALI youth in govt jobs, Illegal migration from BANGLADESH (displacement of traditional agriculture workers), Outnumbering of native tribes in the electoral rolls by outsiders.

**Question** - Linguistic regional rather than religious identities have been the basis of ethnonationalism in INDIA. Discuss?

- **Ethnonationalism** based its legitimacy on language, religion, shared historical experiences, etc. to include or exclude people from the nation.

### UNITY IN DIVERSITY

- **Meaning of Unity** = a sense of oneness that binds people together on the basis of uniformity and differences.
- **Bonds of Unity in India -** Geographical, regional, socio-cultural, Miscellaneous,
    - **Geographical** = the first bond of unity is found in geopolitical integration, INDIA is known for its geographical unity with the HIMALAYAS in the north and Ocean on the side, amidst this Geographical unity we stand politically united, for e.g. Single constitution, single citizenship, all of us are governed by same political culture.
    - Temple Culture, places of worship and shrines plays a significant part in promoting interaction and cultural affinity among people, living in different parts of INDIA, hence it is a source of unity which is reflected in the network of sacred places and shrines
    - **Regional Bond of Unity** = Horizontal bond of unity based on caste, and vertical unity on the bases of a common language.

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 34.png>)

- **Cultural Bond of Unity** = Teaching of the religious scriptures, earning religious merits by visiting religious shrines

![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 35.png>)

- **Language** = amidst linguistic diversity Hindi and English (Hinglish) act as a unifying thread, and even SANSKRIT also acts as a bridge language.
- **Miscellaneous Examples** = Festivals, Cuisines, cinema, ALL INDIA SERVICES, Educational Institutions, workplace, defence forces, tourism, patriotism, parliament, social media, nationalism, art forms, etc.

- Diversity in Unity = e.g. Patriarchy, marriage, patriotism, etc.

## SECULARISM

- **Concept of secularism**
- **Models of secularism**
    - **US**
    - **France**
    - **India**
- **Contemporary issues**
    - **Uniform civil code**
    - **Essential religious practices**

- **The concept of secularism** = is defined as the principle of separation of govt institutions and people who have the mandate to represent the state from religious institutions and dignitaries.
- Devoid of both inter and intra-religious domination
- Promote equality and freedom both within religion and between religions.
- To separate the sphere of state from the sphere of religion - the nature and extent of separation depends on the intent and values it promotes (different for different countries)

### MODELS OF SECULARISM

| | | |
|---|---|---|
|**US**|**France**|**India**|
|The concept was given by THOMAS JEFFERSON|**Laicite** (ले सीटे)|---|
|The state shall not adopt any religion as the state religion.|Strict separation of state and religion|The Wall of separation is porous|
|The sphere of politics is separate from the sphere of religion (mutually exclusive - distance at a arms length), No one shall be discriminated against on the basis of religion he/she practices.<br><br>![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 37.png>)|Although the state doesn't support any religion neither does it discourage any, provided religion is not interfering with the state or other citizen's rights|Religion can never interfere in politics, however, politics can interfere in religion to give effect to progressive voices within the religion and to disagree with certain aspects of it, for e.g. abolition of untouchability, and triple talaq. etc. **Principled distance**<br><br>![Society - समाज](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Society - समाज 38.png>)|
|**Rationale -** It is based on the rationale that religion constitutes a private affair hence it will not be a matter of state policy or intervention|**Rationale -** The church was dominating, so to curtail the authority of the church, domesticate religion, Secularization (differentiation, privatization and decline in social significance of religion)|**Rationale -** INDIA has multiple religious groups. Although its idea was inspired by western origin it is rooted in INDIA'S unique socio-historic circumstances for e.g. the Freedom struggle which advocated equal respect for all religions.|
|**Rights -** it interprets equality and liberty wrt individual, little scope for community-based rights|--|**Rights -** it deals with both individual and community-specific Rights|
|**Scope -** it has no scope for state-supported religious reforms|**Scope -** Any overt practice or expression of religious beliefs/symbols is forbidden in the public sphere|**Scope -** it is compatible with the idea of state-supported religious reforms|

- **Principled Distance** = allows the state to be distant from all religions so that it can intervene or abstain from intervention depending upon what is preferred to promote liberty, equality, and justice.

**Question** - How INDIAN Model of secularism is different from that of the west. Discuss? (10 marks)

## SOCIETY CLASS 11

## UNIFORM CIVIL CODE (UCC)

- **For-**
    - Women empowerment
    - uniformity in personal laws
    - Reduce the legal burden
    - End to vote bank politics
    - National cohesion
    - Progressive laws
    - Promote scientific temperament

- **Against-**
    - Lack of a blueprint
    - Apprehensions among minorities
    - lack of political will due to the sensitive nature of topics
    - Aggravate the religious conflict which will threaten the social/secular fabric of INDIA.
    - Dilute essence of 'salad bowl theory' of multiculturalism.
    - Tendency of religious chauvinism.
    - Lack of responsible use of social media.
    - Lack of among people wrt UCC.
        1. For e.g. instead of using it as a tool for empowerment, uniformity, progressive laws, it is seen from the prism of religious differences.

- **Concluding Remark-**
    - Democracies can be established in those countries which are multicultural however efforts should be made to end the cultural exclusion, development of complementary identities, and promotion of unity in diversity
    - National cohesion doesn't require the imposition of common identity but accommodation of diversity
    - Hence, any decision wrt UCC should be on the basis of popular consensus

- **Way Forward-**
    - Instead of implementing UCC in one single step foot in the door technique should be used
    - Persuading respective religious leaders to create awareness among the people wrt what constitutes UCC
    - Educating the masses through social media
    - Prepare a draft for UCC while preparing all the stakeholders to need to be involved and once prepared it should be put on the public platforms for deliberations, discussion, and debates
    - Till the time a popular consensus is built state can continue to bring reforms in personal laws of different religions
    - **For Example-**
        1. Abolition of triple talaq, adoption of laws under the juvenile justice act
        2. At the same time NGOs, Civil Societies as well as cultural platforms should strive to drive away the mistrust between different religious communities

**Que**. Discuss the possible factors which are inhibiting the implementation of UCC in INDIA.

**Que**. UCC is much needed for INDIA to progress in the 21st century. Critically analyse the statement.

### ESSENTIAL RELIGIOUS PRACTICES VS JUDICIOPAPISM

- The doctrine of essentiality evolved in the 1954 SHIRUR MUTT case
- This doctrine is to protect those practices which are essential and integral to the religion
- The term religion covers all rituals, practices even dressing
- The court said they will determine what constitutes the essential practice

#### SANTHARA

- Voluntarily giving up food and water so as to end life
- PIL was filed by NIKHIL SONI in RAJASTHAN HC
- Court banned SANTHARA a right to life doesn't include the right to die
- It was equated with suicide and was considered not to be an essential religious practice
- However, SC put a stay and said HC made an error in interpreting JAIN practice and JAIN scholars were not consulted by HC
- The court should not whether the practice is ERP or not, in case it does it is an act of **Judiciopapism**

#### TRIPLE TALAQ

- Talaq-e-biddat is declared null and void it is considered as criminal offence with 3 years of jail and fine
- It is cognizable when women file a complaint or any related by blood
- There is a provision of reconciliation without Nikal Halala if both the parties stop legal proceedings
- Provision of allowance and custody of the child
- The magistrate can grant bail after hearing the wife

**Analysis-**

- It serves the purpose of stringent law, aims to bring about gender justice, provides redressal to women act as a source of deterrence, not an essential religious practice hence state can intervene
- However few sections in society have questioned the act on the following grounds-
    i) Criminalization of a civil offense
    ii) How will man provide subsidence allowance if he is in jail
    iii) it might aggravate the incidence of divorce and abandonment
    iv) In fact it is the nikah Halala that needs to be criminalized as it is violative of women's rights

#### SABARIMALA

- With respect to this issue, there were two sets of arguments-
    - Women were allowed entry into the temple by the court
    - _What are the matters that required a reservation of constitutional bench?_
        - Restricting the women based on biological factors amount for discrimination or not?
        - Restricting such women (in mensural period) comes under essential religious practices under Article 25 or not?

**For**-

- banning the entry is derogatory to her dignity
- Patriarchy in religion can not supersede the freedom to practice religion
- Any exclusion on the basis of physiological factors is unconstitutional
- The prohibition was a form of practicing untouchability

- **The doctrine of the living tree-**
    - The constitution is not a static document and the ambit of provisions can be widened as society evolves
    - Prohibition is not an ERP and hence not protected u/a 25
    - FRs are meant for individuals not for idols

**Against-**

- It was considered an act of Judiciopapism
- Diversity is confused with discrimination that is different religious shrines have different religious customs so what is being observed is restriction and not discrimination
- There existed a historic origin of the restriction
- In a plural society like INDIA, entertaining PILs challenging various practices can cause a threat to the secular fabric of the country

    - Types
    - Demographic dividend
- Factors affecting population change
    - Fertility
    - Mortality
    - Migration
- Vulnerable section of population
- Population policy

**Debate-**

**I) It is a liability:**

- Strain over limited resources
- Reason for social conflict
- **ii) It is a asset**-
    - If there is human capital formation

- **Human capital formation-**
    - It refers to the skills, knowledge, and health acquired during life to maximize efficiency and become a productive asset to the society

### DEMOGRAPHY

- **Concept-**

    ii) Social - Nothing but analysis wrt cause and consequence of statistics.

- **Demographic dividend-**
    - Population bulge in working for age group i.e. 15-59 years which is expected to peak in 2036 (65% of the population in 15-59 years)
    - **DD** is the Economic growth potential created due to the rise in the working-age population
    - The bulge in the working age group is only a necessary condition but doesn't guarantee economic growth
    - **It depends upon two factors**-
        - The quality of the workforce
        - Job opportunities

## SOCIETY CLASS 12

### MIGRATION

- **Statistics:**
    - **450 million** (internal migrants)
    - Constitutes **37%** of INDIAN population are migrants.
    - Out of this, **68%** of migrants are women which is the feminization of migration.
- **Types of internal migration**:
    - Rural to Rural (R to R) = **62%**
    - Rural to Urban (R-U) = **20%**
    - Urban to Urban (U-U) = **13%**

    - U.P., BIHAR, JHARKHAND, ODISHA, etc.
- **Place of destination:**
    - DELHI, PUNJAB, HARYANA, MAHARASHTRA, TAMILNADU, etc.

#### CONSEQUENCES FOR REGION

**Source Region:**

- **Economic**:
    - Loss of human resources.
    - It creates the opportunity for the government in the source areas to invest limited resources to ensure the development of the remaining population.
    - Benefits of remittances.
    - If migration is of surplus population, then it is a win-win situation.
- **Demographic:**
    - Feminization of workforce.
    - Increase in the dependent population. (15<>60)
    - Decrease in birth rate (Male-specific distress migration).
    - Increase the probability of child labour.
- **Socio-cultural:**
    - Migrants act as an agent of social change.
    - New ideas get diffused.
    - **E.g.**: W.r.to family planning, girl education, etc.
    - Progressive value system.
    - The absence of adult males for a long time might lead to the dislocation/disruption of the family.
    - Increase in the incidences of violence against women and children.
    - Emergence of female headed households.
- **Political:**
    - The decline in political participation.
    - Even the political leaders also diffuse their responsibility.
    - It does create the potential for efficient delivery of services --> Good governance.

**Destination areas:**

- Lack of trust between migrants and locals as migrants are preferred to take away the opportunity meant for locals.
- Probability of identity politics (example of SHIV SENA and rise of labour parties) --> **Son of the Soil theory**.
- The proliferation of slums (due to over-urbanization).
- Increase incidences of crimes due to feelings of relative deprivation.
- Ghettoization is based on primordial identities due to a lack of cultural migration.
- Skewed sex ratio in case of Male-specific migration.
- Failure of state administration with respect to good governance due to rising in population pressure.
- Creates potential for economic growth (availability of working age population).
- The rise in social tolerance.
- Cosmopolitan culture.
- Unity in Diversity.

#### CONSEQUENCES FOR MIGRANTS

- **Positives**:
    - Access to better infrastructure with respect to health, education, skills, etc.
    - Probability of Human capital formation.
    - Potential for women empowerment especially when the destination is urban areas.
    - Social capital formation. (समाज शशक्ति करण, mutual trust, opportunities, PR which are creating economic outcomes)
    - Social innovation. (in centre of urbanism)
    - Ability to escape the trap of social pathologies (E.g.: Caste, patriarchy, racism, etc).

- **Negatives**:
    - Lack of job stability.
    - Mostly confined to the informal sector --> lack of minimum wage, lack of social security benefits, more vulnerable to exploitation, etc.
    - In the absence of documentation, the problem gets aggravated.
    - Mostly **seasonal migrants** (139 million -> ECONOMIC SURVEY-2017).
        1. Problem of education of child of seasonal migrants (80% of child's of seasonal migrants don't have access to schools)
        2. Lack of portability of benefits - (_one nation one ration card policy)_
        3. Reduce the status to ghost citizens
    - Victim of identity politics
    - Issue of marginal man.
    - Problem of housing/sanitization and poor health.
    - Intergenerational transmission of poverty.

#### INITIATIVES

- For **Food safety:**

    - The benefits under AYUSHMAN BHARAT are made portable across the country.

**Legislative measures w.r.t migrants:**

- INTERSTATE MIGRANTS WORKMEN ACT.
- UNORGANIZED SECTOR WORKER ACT.
- CODE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, 2020.

- For **employment**:
    - PM GARIB KALYAN YOJANA.

#### WAY FORWARD

- Judicial implementation of existing legislative measures.
- Providing skills to the migrant workers to increase their desirability in the labour market.
- Active participation of NGOs and civil society to drive away the mistrust between natives and migrants.
- Developing source regions in order to address the issues of rapid and skewed migration.
- The politicization of the issue of migration needs to be checked.
- Mapping of migrant workers so as to collect credible data for effective policy making.
- Inter-state and inter-district coordination committees to trace the movement of migrants.
- Establish **migrant labour cells** in each state so as to ensure their rights are secured.
- Sensitize and train policymakers, local government officials, employers, and financial institutions regarding the obstacles faced by migrants in accessing public services.

**Que**: To what extent does migration create the opportunity for social mobility. Discuss (10 marks/150 words)

### POPULATION POLICY

- **Concept:**
    - Purposeful measures aim to affect demographic processes such as fertility, mortality, migration, etc.
- **Types**:
    I) Ante-natal
    ii) Distributional

#### EVOLUTION

- **Pre-independence:**
    - Period of indifference.
- **1947-51:**
    - Period of neutrality.
- **1951-61:**
    - Period of experimentation
- **1952:** National Family Planning Program.
    - Clinical approach: Infrastructural supports will be provided to the couples who are positively disposed towards the idea of family planning.
- **1961-71**: - three below approaches
    - Extension approach: Generating awareness w.r.to benefits of a small family.
    - Cafeteria approach: Awareness/availability of different methods of family planning but the ultimate choice is with people.
    - Selective approach: targeted intervention for couples b/w age group 25-35
- **1978**:
- **First** National Population Policy.
    - Renaming the family planning to family welfare programming to the implementation of the child marriage restraint Act where the minimum age was increased to 18 and 21 for girls and boys respectively.
    - Voluntarily sterilization.
    - Monetary incentives for sterilization include population, and education, as a part of the study curriculum.
    - Use of media for spreading awareness.
    - Focus on research in reproductive biology and contraception.
    - Population efforts were criticised by M.S. SWAMINATHAN who gave the following recommendations:
        **a.** In a patriarchal society, the onus of population control should not be on women.
        **b.** Discontinue the policy of monetary incentives for sterilization.
        **c.** Democratic and decentralized policy-making is the need of the hour (since there are different causes responsible for population growth hence one size fit all approach is not advisable).

- **2000:**
- **Second** National Population Policy.
    - It was introduced with the objective to improve the quality of life and provide the opportunity to become productive assets for society.

- There are **three goals** which were **set up:**
    - **Immediate targets**:
        - To meet unmet needs of contraception, lack of health infrastructure, health workforce, and ensure Integrated Service delivery w.r.t reproductive health.
    - **Mid-term targets**:
        - Reduce TFR =2.1 by 2010.
    - **Long-term targets**:
        - Stabilize population by 2045.

#### TWO-CHILD POLICY

- **In favour:**
    - To address the issue of the declining health of women.
    - **E.g.:** An increase in MMR (maternal mortality rate) (problem of maternal depletion syndrome).
    - **HFR** (High Fertility Ratio) = Creates pressure on limited resources --> Discrepancy in demand & supply --> Relative deprivation --> Conflict/crime.
    - For optimum utilization of existing. -> focus on human capital formation -> lack of relative deprivation
    - Would help in breaking the vicious cycle of poverty.

- **Against**:
    - Already the fertility rate has declined in most of states.
    - It will further create the problem of sex-selective abortion.
    - There will be a shortage of young educated population in long run.
    - Sex-selective abortion will lead to a **skewed sex ratio** which will further the violence against women.
    - It might lead to social disruption, divorce, abandoning of a child, deserting of wife, etc.
    - It is **against** the constitutional provision under **article 21.**
    - The old age population will increase.

## URBANIZATION

- **Concept:**

        - --> Change in residence.
        - --> Change in occupation.
        - --> change in values/attitude/beliefs, etc.

- **The ideology of Urbanism**:

- Way of life.

    - --> Complex division of labour.
    - --> High level of technology.
    - --> High social mobility.
    - --> Economic interdependence.
    - --> Impersonality in social relations.

- WORLD URBANIZATION PROSPECT REPORT, 2018:
    - INDIA, CHINA, and NIGERIA will constitute major urbanization population growth between **2018-2050.**
- According to the CONFEDERATION REAL STATE DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION OF INDIA, the urban population contributes **63%** of INDIA'S GDP.
- **Urban poverty** is increasing, according to the WORLD BANK by 2035, most of the extremely poor will be found in urban areas.

#### TYPES OF URBANIZATION

- **Over urbanization**:
    - Level of urbanization >> level of industrialization.
    - It will lead to real estate prices increasing and also cost of living and standard of living decrease.
    - Public transportation.
    - New Work culture: Work From Home.
- **Sub-urbanization**:

- **Urban sprawl:**
    - A dispersed outgrowth of areas outside the city's core engulfing villages.
    - It is characterized by low-density residential housing.
    - There is an increased reliance on a private vehicles.

## SOCIETY CLASS 13

### COUNTER URBANISATION

- It is referred to as a social and demographic process where the population moves back from urban to rural areas due to inner city deprivation, overcrowding, and pollution.
- Mushrooming farmhouse culture.

#### SLUMS

- **Slums** are urban residential dwellings that are unfit for human habitation, as it is dilapidated, poorly ventilated, and unclean. Lack essential resources required for basic living For example WASH (Drinking water, Sanitation, Hygiene)
- Slums were proliferation due to rapid migration.
- WORLD BANK (In 2018) states that 35.2% of the urban population lives in slums.
- A general perception was that slums were proliferating due to migration.
- However, according to an expert group on urban poverty and slums, it results from the failure of housing policies.

#### PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO HOUSING

- Improper city planning due to heritage of past constructions.
- Lack of private developers w.r.t. housing for the poor.
- Lack of integrated planning. The entire focus is on land use, without taking into consideration, environmental aspects, transportation, and socio-economic needs.
- Failure to implement the NATIONAL URBAN HOUSING AND HABITAT POLICY, according to which 15% of the land is to be allocated every year for social housing.
- The problem of gated communities:
- It will lead to unaffordable housing.
- Corruption, laxity on part of the administration, political will, etc.

- Although slums were perceived to be a temporary problem, however, it has now become a permanent structural problem. **Why?**

##### SLUMS ARE PERSISTING DUE TO

- They are the most politically active section of society.
- Hence constitute a major vote bank.
- It contributes to the labour force as the majority of the informal economy is thriving in slums.
- Sub-culture of poverty: There exists a subculture of poverty, hence, a feeling of relative deprivation does not develop.
- So slums are still persisting.
- They have immense resilience power and adaptive quality.

#### THE WAY FORWARD

- Developing social security net for slum dwellers.
- Sustainable urban development.
- Employment generation and skill development of migrants.
- Capacity building in urban local bodies.
- Provide affordable housing.

#### PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

- The problem of waste generation and waste management.
- Rapid urbanization has caused environmental degradation as congestion of people in limited space reduces the quality of air and contaminates water.
- According to WORLD AIR QUALITY REPORT by IQ AIR, 10 out of 15 polluted cities are in INDIA.
- According to WWF, by 2050, at least 30 INDIAN cities will face major water risks.
- The problems range from poor management of water resources, leaky distribution networks, and the vast volume of untreated wastewater being dumped in INDIAN rivers.
- Transportation: inadequate road infrastructure and inefficient public transportation systems lead to capacity overloading and problems like road accidents, traffic jams, etc.

#### SOCIO-CULTURAL PROBLEMS

- Residential segregation based on primordial identities (caste, class, religion, ethnicity) leads to a spatial pattern of communal violence.
- Relative deprivation due to unequal access to resources leads to crime.
- Degradation of value system: aggravated the abuse against marginalized sections.
- The proliferation of slums:
    - Isolated areas.
    - High probability of pathological behaviour.
    - Lack of resilience wrt financial, natural disasters.
- The disintegration of joint families:
    - Lack of primary socialization.
    - Lack of social control.
    - Would lead to Increase in juvenile delinquency.
- Quality of life.
- Social stratification.
- The vicious cycle of poverty.
- Lack of trust between migrants and natives.
- Cognitive development of people.
- Marginal man.
- Loss of human capital.

- The planning should include the needs of the marginalized.
- Several sources of funding need to be tapped for example PPP, issuing of municipal bonds monetization of land assets.
- Cascaded planning structure.
- One needs to have plans for a long-term vision along with immediate targets.
- With respect to local capacity building:
    - New cadre for city administrators.
    - Development of professional managers.
    - Development of expertise.
- Encourage rental housing.
- New models of development need to be explored.
- Transport-oriented development.
