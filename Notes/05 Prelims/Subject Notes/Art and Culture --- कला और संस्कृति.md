## Art
is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination like painting, sculpture, music, dance, architecture

- There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures.
  - The three classical branches of visual art are [painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting), [sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture), and [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture).
  - [Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre), [dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance), and other [performing arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts), as well as [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature), [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music), [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) and other media such as [interactive media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_media), are included in a broader definition of [the arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts).
  - Until the 17th century, _art_ referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [crafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft) or [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciences).
  - In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the [fine arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art) are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the [decorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_arts) or [applied arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts).
  - The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and [interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic_interpretation), are explored in a branch of philosophy known as [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics). The resulting [artworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artworks) are studied in the professional fields of [art criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_criticism) and the [history of art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_history).

## CULTURE
IS THE CUSTOMS, ARTS, SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF GROUP OF PEOPLE REGARDED COLLECTIVELY

- **Culture**: an umbrella term which encompasses the [social behaviours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior), [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution), and [norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm) found in [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) [societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society), as well as the [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge), [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief), [arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art), [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law), [customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm), capabilities, and [habits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) of the individuals in these groups.
  - CULTURE is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location.
  - Humans acquire CULTURE through the [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning) processes of [enculturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enculturation) and [socialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.

A [cultural norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_norm) codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behaviour, dress, language, and demeanour in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.

- Thus in military culture, [valour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage) is counted a typical behaviour for an individual and duty, honour, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the [continuum of conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_of_conflict).
- In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.

CULTURAL change, or repositioning, is the reconstruction of a CULTURAL concept of a society. CULTURES are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. CULTURES are externally affected via contact between societies.

Organizations like [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) attempt to preserve CULTURE and CULTURAL heritage.
