## Poverty and Hunger

### Poverty

![Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय 2.png>)

**Concept**

- - According to Amartya Sen poverty is referred to the deprivation of basic capabilities in life rather than mere lowness of lack of income. it is not just about survival but contribution and participation in various aspects of life.
    - Food Without environment/education(wrt hygiene) = state of poverty.
    - Having access to food but lack of environment and education to relish the food or to enjoy the food. for example- the problem of Open Defecation.
    - ![Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय 3.png>)

- - Equally dependent on nature ==> Equally vulnerable ==> natural poverty
    - Poverty is an artificial construct, social construct ==> because of inequitable distribution of socio-economic development.

**Question:- Poverty in the context of India is socially generated and perpetuated. Discuss.**

- - How Perpetuated ===> Bonded labour, Patriarchy, Caste-based occupational division, Gender-based occupation, the Geographical Isolation of Tribals, manual scavenging, transgenders have less access to resources, Slums. 

### Approaches to Poverty

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Nutritional approach or Objective approach**|**Relative deprivation approach**|
|- - - Applied in the context of developing and under developing countries<br>        - Deals with a minimum intake of food to maintain the working capacity of individual<br>        - Demarcates poor from non-poor|- - - Applied in the context of developed countries<br>        - Deals with social inequalities of society<br>        - It highlights the exclusion of class from participation in different aspects of social life due to a lack of resources|

**Question- To Eradicate Poverty it needs to be treated as a violation of Human Rights. comment.** 

**Question- Is poverty a violation of human rights? Critically examine this in the context of India.**

#### _Poverty as a Violation of Human Rights_

**Violation of Human Rights**

- - Economic manifestation - it denies the economic right i.e. right to work, adequate income (equal pay and equal work), right to safe working conditions
    - Social manifestation - Denial of access to health, education, and skill development.
    - Political manifestation- Freedom of thought, expression, and association. 
    - Cultural manifestation - Right to maintain cultural identity and lack of ability to meaningfully engage in cultural life.

- - **But is it always?**

- - If Poverty is the result of ===> Development-related displacement + lack of proper implementation of a policy due to failure of identification of beneficiary ===> then it is a human rights violation.
    - It will be treated as a violation of human rights if it is the direct consequence of government policy or the failure of the government to act. For example- development-led displacement policy of tribal, poor identification of beneficiaries, etc
    - **However**, if it is construct of individuals in action, it will not be treated as a violation of human rights. for example - seeking immediate gratification in the form of intoxication or addiction to online gambling or gaming, lack of will to migrate in search of jobs, denying women labour market participation due to patriarchy.

**Question- What are SDG goals targeted with respect to poverty? Briefly analyse to what extent we have been able to achieve those targets.**

**Question- Poverty, and hunger are one of the biggest challenges for good governance in India still today, evaluate how far successive governments have progressed in dealing with these humongous problems. suggest measures for improvement.** 

**Achievements**

- - World bank published a paper According which extreme poverty in India has declined to 10.2%. (it was 22.5% in 2011)
    - Poverty reduction is higher in rural areas as compared to urban areas.
    - Income for small farmers has increased by 10% in annual terms as against 2% for large farmers in this period,  2013-2019.

**Issues**

- - A regional variation where the majority of India's poverty is concentrated in rural areas and low-income states for example- according to the national MPI, Bihar has the highest proportion of multidimensionally poor people whereas Kerala has registered the lowest population poverty levels
    - Feminization of poverty especially in rural areas for example -the wage gap in the agriculture sector is around **35.8%**.
    - Rapid urbanization has resulted in an increasing demand-supply gap with respect to basic infrastructure (housing, safe drinking water, sanitation ).
    - With respect to education, employment, and human resource development there is the issue of lack of eligibility with respect to the labour market. (49% of graduates are not eligible for employment )

### Causes of Poverty

**Economic causes**

1). Low agricultural productivity

2). The decline in village industries

3). Immobility of labour

4). Globalisation ===> informalisation of labour market

5). **Systemic disruption**==> COVID 19, global conflicts

6). Lack of a culture of self-employment

7). **Nature of economic growth**===> failure to create jobs in areas that can readily absorb labour

8). Lack of investment in human capital formation

**Demographic causes**

- - **HFR- High Fertility Rate**
        - Pressure on limited resources;
        - Lack of income available after expenditure for development
    - **Age structure** -
        - FORCED and INVOLUNTARY ===> public perspective, ageism, and prejudice towards elderly population + failure to create employment for the elderly
    - **Health profile**-
        - High disease burden ===> poor learning outcome ===> low productivity at workplace
        - Direct cause ===> health cost, in-patient and out-patient,  out-of-pocket expenditure ===> poverty

**Socio-Cultural factors**

- - Joint family 
    - Patriarchy
    - Caste system 
    - 4 A [ availability, accessibility, affordability and awareness] + Q [ quality]===> education
    - Social customs and practices ==> pressure by society to take the loans for marriage leading to a debt trap, customs during the marriage
    - Ghettoization on the basis of Primordial identities.

**Politico-Administrative factors**

- - Corruption + Red tapism
    - Development-led displacement policies
    - Lack of proper implementation of government policies
    - War/conflict
    - Son of Soil theory

**Climatic factors**

- - Flood
    - Earthquake, Cyclone
    - At the global level, there is 3C's - Climate change, COVID 19, Conflict ===> derailing the development achieved so far 

### Government Efforts so far

- - Five-year plans
    - Nationalization of banks
    - 20-point program during the emergency

**Government schemes**

- - a). Wage employment ==> MGNREGA
    - b). Self-employment===> Standup India
    - c). Social security ===> PMJAY
    - d). Food security===> NFSA
    - e). Miscellaneous====> PMGSY (PM gram Sadak yojana===> innovation-diffusion approach===> road connectivity will lead to women empowerment  )

**Question- Despite the implementation of various programs for the eradication of poverty, poverty is still persisting. explain by giving reasons.**

**Lacunae**

- - Poor identification of beneficiaries
    - Centralized top-down approach 
    - One size fit approach
    - Leakages, misappropriation of funds
    - Lack of requisite infrastructure 
    - Lack of awareness among people with respect to their rights and entitlements.
    - Low government spending with respect to social infrastructure
    - Lack of credible data for effective policy making
    - Failure to ensure proper evaluation and plugging of loopholes
    - The narrow interpretation of poverty only in economic terms and overlooking social pathologies.

### Way Forward

- - **Capability Approach**- Amartya Sen ==>According to him Entitlements are significant for poverty reduction; **Entitlements**=the ability of an individual to transform assets into goods example- growing food on your own land
    - For example- Kerala model of development, here the emphasis is on high literacy, Access to health care, low fertility rate, low IMR, etc.
    - **Jagdish Bhagwati model**-
    - Only focus on growth can produce enough resources for investment in social infrastructure
    - Although initially, it might generate inequality but sustained growth will ensure enough resources at the disposal of states which can be redistributed to mitigate initial inequalities
    - For example -The Gujrat model of development-It has major components :

1). Quantum jump in infrastructure to facilitate the growth of corporate investment

2). Quantum jump in governance to address the requirement of corporate units

3). Incentives and subsidies to the corporate sector to attract investment

- - **Orissa's model of development**
    - The state has successfully brought down the poverty levels from 63% to 29%.
    - Over 80 lakh people have been lifted from the poverty line
    - The steps focussed on controlling child malnutrition, building the capacity of women SHGs
    - Ensuring last mile connectivity, roads, etc.

### Hunger

![Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय 4.png>)

**Concept**

- - The situation of distress is associated with a lack of food. 

**Manifestation-** 

- - Undernourishment- according to FAO if consuming less than 1800 calorie/day
    - Malnutrition - According to WHO it is defined as any kind of deficiency, Excess, or Imbalance with respect to a person's intake of nutrients. 
    - A situation where the individual is not able to do things that are considered normal.  For example - growing, or fighting the disease (weak immune system)
    - It has three manifestations

a). Undernutrition - Stunting (height/ age); Underweight or low weight (weight / age); Wasting (weight/height)

b). Micronutrient deficiency - HIDDEN HUNGER

c). Diet-related non-communicable diseases- overweight, diabetes, obesity

#### _Causes_

![Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय 5.png>)

- - 1). **Lack of food** - poverty, unemployment, inflation, climate change, conflict, COVID 19, Lack of proper implementation of schemes related to food security, social pathologies such as patriarchy, casteism, agricultural productivity disruption, etc.
    - 2). **Lack of nutritious food** - due to the negative impact of the Green revolution (lack of diversified diet ), lack of awareness, due to adulterated food, McDonaldization of food, the high price of nutritious food, wheat-rice cycle, lack of nutrition education as part of the curriculum, the problem with the packaging, overuse of Agro chemicals e.g. fertilizers, lack of proper advertisement====> Hidden Hunger. 
    - 3). **Lack of absorption of nutritious food by the body** - The body is not able to absorb food - WASH = due to lack of access to safe sanitation, hygiene, drinking water, disease burden, and lack of essential vitamins and minerals.

### Implications

- - **At the individual level**
    - Hunger==> low physical and cognitive development, poor learning outcome, poor ability to absorb skills, vulnerable to diseases===>  productivity will decline in economic sphere====> poverty===> lack of food, lack of nutritious food , lack of absorption by body====> Hunger (vicious cycle)

- - **At the Family level**
    - Intergenerational transmission of hunger and malnutrition
    - Direct and indirect economic costs associated with hunger
    - The decline in the standard of living
    - Negative impact on interpersonal relationships in the family

- - **At the national level**
    - Loss of human capital threatens the ability of nations to reap the benefits of demographic dividend
    - Creates a strain on limited government resources
    - Will widen the inequalities which will generate the feeling of relative deprivation which will lead to Crime, which will further increase the instances of the economic cost associated with it

**Question - How far do you agree with a view that focuses on the lack of availability of food as the main cause of hunger takes the attention away from ineffective human development policies in India?**

**SDG and Hunger**

- - Goal 2 ===> End hunger, Improve nutrition, Ensure food security and Promote sustainable agriculture.

**Targets**

- - Universal access to safe and nutritious food
    - End all forms of malnutrition
    - Double the productivity and income of small-scale food producers.
    - Maintain Genetic Diversity in food production by adopting Resilient Agriculture Practices.

**Government efforts**

- - End hunger==>Digitization of ration card, one nation one ration card.
    - Improve nutrition ==> POSHAN Abhiyan.
    - Ensure food security==>PDS, NFSA, MDM.
    - Sustainable agriculture ===>Environment stability + social stability + economic stability ===>Crop diversification, Natural farming, Socio-economic stability (land reforms, Cooperatives, SHG, access to small farmers and marginal farmers, women should also have access to credit, technology, etc)

**Achievements**

- - 97.6% of beneficiaries are covered under NFSA.
    - 6 times increase in Food Production [50 MT in (1950-51) to 292 MT (2019-2020)] {**PARADOX of PLENTY**= one side plenty of food v/s hungry mouth to feed}
    - By 2019,  11.4 million hectares of land were brought under micro irrigation.
    - There has been a 2.5 times increase in land under certified organic farming
    - Fruits and vegetables productivity increased by 11 % (2011-12===> 2019-20)
    - According to NFHS 5 ====> for under 5 age===>stunting is 35.5 %, and wasting is 19.3%, underweight is 32.1 % as compared to NFHS 4 all has decreased (it is an achievement)

**Issues**

- - Food wastage at different stages
    - The rigid social structure of society also impacts the availability of food
    - Continuing high levels of stunting, wasting, underweight, etc
    - The problem of hidden hunger, climate change threatening food security, access to safe WASH

**Challenges in tackling hunger and malnutrition**

- - Weak implementation of schemes
    - Lack of qualified human resources (challenges with respect to ASHA workers)
    - The fragility of the globalized food system (over-dependence on food imports; under-investment in local farmers, diet-related NCDs)
    - Food wastage - 7% of total food production and 30% of fruits and vegetables are wasted due to a lack of storage facilities.
    - The low status of women. 
    - Change in the lifestyle (sedentary lifestyle, over-dependence on technology, and McDonaldization of food habits)

**Way Forward**

- - Poverty alleviation - more investment in disaster prevention and risk reduction ===> Early warning system, forecasting, etc
    - Mitigate climate change
    - Create awareness with respect to Nutritious food
    - Motivate and incentivize the food suppliers and producers to ensure the availability and affordability of healthy food
    - Prevent adulteration of food by ensuring mandatory labelling on the front pack
    - Collect, Analyse, and use good quality data to guide action and track progress.
    - Introduce/Empower women as an agency of change
    - Fortification and bio-fortification of food.
    - Promote the culture of a diversified diet

**Question- Can the vicious cycle of gender inequality, poverty, and malnutrition be broken through the microfinancing of women's SHGs? Explain with examples. (150 words /10 marks)**

**Vicious cycle** 

- - **National economic development** [diminished economic development, limited capacity to development+ health+ education system]====>**Individual** [life cycle of malnutrition, diminished physical and cognitive development, poverty, limited economic resources, increased disease burden]===> **Labour** **Force** [reduced working capacity, limited jobs/ underpaid jobs, less life expectancy, low lifetime earning] ====> **Poor economic development** (completing the vicious cycle)

## Health

- - ![Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Social Justice --- सामाजिक न्याय 7.png>)

**Concept**:

- - According to WHO, Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of diseases. 
    - It refers to any good that benefits the largest number of people in the largest possible way 
    - Health is a social good - as it ensures better absorption of other social products e.g. education, skill development, etc 
    - It enables society to become tolerant, equitable, and sustainable 
    - Health is an economic good - It has both direct and indirect benefits
    - For example, better absorption of skills; better productivity at the workplace; low spending due to low disease burden  
    - Political Good - Being healthy ensures active and informed participation in the political process which enables it to become democratic, decentralized, and accountable. 
    - Ecological Good - It will ensure sustainable production, consumption, and overall development 

**Statistics**:

- - TFR is 2 and Institutional birth - is 88.6%
    - Out-of-pocket expenditure - 48.8%
    - Govt spending on health - 1.35%
    - Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) in the country is 26 per 1000 live births.
    - The share of primary health care in govt expenditure is 54.7% and IMR - 35.2

**Issues wrt the Health care system:**

- - Weak PHC - primary health care
    - Lack of infrastructure - quality and quantity 
        - WHO says we need 1 doctor for 1000 people but we have 1 for 1456 people
        - Also, 3 nurses for every thousand people but we have 1.7.
        - 53% of medical practitioners do not have the required medical qualification  
    - Rural-Urban divide along with the regional divide  
    - Privatization of Healthcare, Lack of regulation 
    - High out-of-pocket expenditure and Poverty
    - Limited insurance coverage 
    - Provide induced demand (irrelevant tests or prescription for profit motive)
    - Lack of R&D
    - Dependent on imports of API
    - Dual burden of CD and NCD (communicable and non communicable diseases)
    - Lack of Medical ethics 
    - Lack of adequate development of the traditional medicinal system 
    - Overall lack of 4A'Q
    - Lack of availability of hospitals for empanelment 
    - Health is a state subject and the presence of quacks, etc 

**3 tiers of the Healthcare system**:

- - First point of contact between individuals and health infrastructure 
    - According to Alma Atta Declaration, the purpose of PHC is family planning, vaccination, nutritional awareness, access to WASH   
    - The goal of PHC is to reduce exclusion and organize healthcare services around the need of the people 
    - Ensure community participation, and development of the health workforce
    - Use of appropriate technology, the development of the multi-sectoral approach 
    - Secondary healthcare: It is the second tier of the healthcare system where patients from primary care are referred to specialists in higher hospitals provided by the district, regional hospitals, and community healthcare centres (CHCs)
    - Issues remain the same as mentioned above 
    - According to Global Health Security Index which measures preparedness with respect to the Pandemic, India's ranking is 66  
    - One of the reasons - due to the dysfunctional state of the integrated diseases surveillance programme whose objective is to monitor disease trends, detect and respond. 
    - However, due to a lack of manpower, resources, and robust database, it has failed to deliver 

**Way forward:**

- - Increase Government spending and Improve private sector participation 
    - Increase insurance coverage 
    - Strengthening of ASHA Workers, Auxiliary Nurse-Midwives, etc 
        - (02/11/22 7:26 PM) Role of ASHA workers need to be formalised
        - Recognition and better wages.
    - Shift to preventive healthcare 
    - Change in the perception with respect to good health 
    - Encouraging women as an agency of health 
    - Rejuvenating the traditional medicinal system 
    - Digitization of healthcare 
    - Focus on emerging issues (mental health care, NCD, Geriatric Care, etc)
    - Successful models can be emulated; for example Mohalla Clinics of Delhi, Tele Medicine of Odisha, Ardram Mission of Kerela - people friendly by making good infra, etc 
    - Ensuring universal health coverage 

### Universal Health Coverage (UHC):

- - It refers to equity in Health services; quality and protection of people against the financial risk 

**Prospects**:

- - It will act as a catalyst for socio-economic development 
    - It will ensure social justice, and inclusive growth and will help in ending extreme poverty 
    - It will help in achieving the SDGs, etc 

**SDG and Health**:

- - Goal 3: Ensure good health and well-being for all 
    - Targets: Reduce MMR and end preventable death under 5 
    - Fight communicable diseases and reduce mortality from NCDs
    - Promote Mental Health Care, prevent and treat substance abuse, and universal access to sexual health and reproductive healthcare services; achieve UHC

**Govt efforts:**

- - ICDS, JSY-Peri-Natal, JSSK-Post Natal, PMSMA-Antenatal Care 
    -  PM-JAY, HWC's, NDHM, SBM, etc 

**The digitalization of Healthcare**:

- - Integration of medical knowledge with IT applications e.g. telemedicine, e-pharmacy, electronic health records, etc 

**Prospects**:

- - It addressed the human resource gap by efficient utilization of existing manpower 
    - Evidence-based policymaking 
    - National portability of health care provisions 
    - Availability of resources in remote areas 
    - Increase efficiency of health care delivery 
    - Reduction in health cost 
    - Reduction in delay by timely accessing the healthcare records 

**Challenges**:

- - Health is a state subject 
    - Lack of computerization, especially in PHCs
    - Lack of internet facility, problem of data safety 
    - Lack of dominant health IT vendors 
    - Ensure, the legitimate consent of the patient 
    - Establish model digital health centres in rural areas 
    - Health is not a medical issue but also a social issue i.e. the problem of availability and accessibility should be deliberated with respect to social pathologies in society 
    - Jan Aushudi Pariyojana should be clubbed with e-pharmacy 
    - The digitalization of all the data with respect to patients 
    - Adequate implementation of the National Digital Health Mission, etc  

### Mental Health:

- - WHO defines mental health as a state of mental well-being in which:
        - 1. people cope well with the stresses of life 
        - 2. Can realise their true potential 
        - 3. Can function fruitfully and productively 
        - 4. Able to contribute to the community 
    - According to WHO mental illness makes up 15% of the total disease burden 
    - WHO released a Global Report, that women are more prone to anxiety and depression; whereas men are more prone to substance abuse 
    - High-Income countries have the highest prevalence of mental disorders among their population 

**Causes**:

- - Modernisation, Urbanisation

    - Objectification and commodification 
    - Due to globalization, moral corruption of various social institutions - family, marriage and peer group
    - Modernization leads to secularisation 

**Covid 19 vis-a-vis Mental health**:

- - The measures such as social distancing, quarantine, temporary closure of schools, etc did generate fear and anxiety 
    - Stigmatization during the pandemic especially with respect to front-line workers and people with co-morbidities 
    - The dual burden on women 
    - Disrupted education and increased exposure to abuse (verbal, physical, etc) negatively impacted the mental health of kids 
    - Lack of responsible journalism 
    - The constant fear of getting infected and lack of access to the appropriate health care 
    - Understaffed and overwhelmed police and healthcare workers 

### Way forward:

- - Awareness generation about Mental Health, Destigmatisation of mental illness 
    - Promoting the culture of yoga and meditation 
    - Strengthening the role of the community 
    - Promoting telemedicine 
    - Following an integrated approach ie detect, treat and manage 
    - Proper implementation of the mental health care act 

## Education

- - **Difference between education and literacy:**
    - Literacy is an objective or quantitative criterion which is confined to the realm of formal schooling 
    - However, education is qualitative in nature which goes beyond formal schooling and includes overall personality development (values, morals, character building, etc)
