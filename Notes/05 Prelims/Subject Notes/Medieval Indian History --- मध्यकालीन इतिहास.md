- Mir Saman:

    - He supervised all purchases and their storage for the royal household.

#### Provincial Administration

- The empire was divided into twelve provinces or Subas by Akbar which later became 20 with the expansion of the Mughal empire.
- A Subedar was appointed as the head of the Province responsible for the maintenance of general law and order.
- The revenue department in the Suba was headed by Diwan.
- The office of Diwan also provided loans called Taqavi to peasants.
- The role of Mir Bakshi was performed by Bakshi at the provincial level.
- Similarly, **Sadr** was responsible for the welfare of those who were engaged in religious activities and learning at the provincial level.
- He also looked after the judicial department and the working of Qazi's.
- To maintain proper communication channels Darogai-i- Dak was appointed.
- Waqainavis and Waqainigars were appointed to provide news of provinces directly to the emperor.

#### Local administration:

- Subahs were divided into Sarkars.
- Sarkars were divided into Parganas which constituted many villages.
    - Suba > Sarkar > Pargana (सुबह सर पर)
- At the level of Sarkar's, two important functionaries existed:
    - **Fauzdar** to maintain law and order.
    - **Amal Guzars or Amil** was revenue collector.
- Amil was expected to increase the land under cultivation and induce the peasants to pay revenue willingly.
    - Revenue assessed through 'batai' and 'nasaq' systems.
- At the level of Pargana, Shiqdar was the executive officer who assisted Amils as the executive officer.
- the Quanungo kept all the records of the land in the Pargana.
- **Kotwals** were appointed mainly in towns to maintain law and order.
- **Muqaddam** was the village headman and **Patwari** looked after village revenue records.
- The services of the Zamindars were also utilised for the maintenance of law and order.
- Forts were placed under an officer called **Qiladar.**

- The port administration was independent of Provincial authority.
- The governor of the port was called Mutasaddi(Muta-saddi) who was directly appointed by the emperor.
- He collected tax on merchandise and maintained the custom house.

#### Mansabdari system:

- It evolved during the reign of Akbar and some modifications were done by later Emperors.
- The word Mansab Literally means position or rank.
- The Mansab awarded to an individual in the Mughal administration fixed both his status in the official hierarchy and his salary.
- It also fixed the number of armed retainers the holders of the Mansab were to maintain.
- Initially, a single number represented the rank.
- However, later the Mansab came to be denoted by two numbers **Zat and Sawar.**
- Zat denoted the personal rank of an official.
- Sawar indicated the size of the contingent(horses) maintained by Mansabdars.
- Based on these two numbers, three categories of Mansabdars came into existence:
    - Zat=Sawar(सबसे बेचारा)
    - 2*Sawar > Zat > Sawar ⭐ (The categories for Mansabdars based on Zat and Sawar ranks are typically: 1. Zat = Sawar; 2. Sawar is half or more than half of Zat; 3. Sawar is less than half of Zat. The condition "2*Sawar > Zat" while also having "Zat > Sawar" is contradictory if Sawar is always less than or equal to Zat. It likely refers to a specific interpretation or a misstatement of the second category.)
    - Zat > 2*Sawar (elites) ⭐ (This category description seems to contradict the usual understanding of Mansabdari ranks where higher Sawar rank relative to Zat indicates higher status and better contingent. "Zat > 2*Sawar" would imply a very small contingent relative to personal rank, which is usually the lowest category, not "elites".)
- Thus, Sawar's rank was either equal to or less than Zat rank.
- Even if the Sawar rank was higher, the Mansabdar position in the official hierarchy was decided by the Zat rank.
- Jahangir introduced new provisions in the Sawar rank, Sawar rank was termed as Du-aspa or Sih-aspa in the case of selected Mansabdars.
- Shah Jahan further modified were to compensate for the gap between Jama(estimated income) and Hasil(actual realisation).
- He introduced the concept of a monthly scale.
- Aurangzeb created an additional rank called Mashrut which was an attempt to increase the Sawar rank temporarily.

#### Jagir System

- Under the Mughals, the area ascended to nobles was called Jagir and holders Jaghirdars.
- The land was broadly divided into Khalisa and Jagir, the revenue from the first went to the imperial treasury and from Jagir ascended to Jagirdars in their services.
- The salary of Mansabs was given either in cash or in Jagir later being the preferable mode.
- Jagirdari was not hereditary
- Also, the percentage of Khalisa and Jagir land fluctuated for different emperors during Aurangzeb's reign the number of claimants for jagir increased with an increase in the number of Mansabdars this led to the Jagirdari crises

- Battle of Dharmat was fought between Aurangzeb and Dara Shikoh by 1658 for Shahjahan's throne.
