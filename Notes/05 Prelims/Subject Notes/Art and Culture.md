2:09 AM Art is theexpression or applicationof human creative skill and imagination like painting, sculpture, music, dance, architecture

- There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures.The three classical branches ofvisual artare[painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting),[sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture), and[architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture).
- [Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre),[dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance), and other[performing arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts), as well as[literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature),[music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music),[film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film)and other media such as[interactive media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_media), are included in a broader definition of[the arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts).
- Until the 17th century,artreferred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from[crafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft)or[sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciences).
- In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the[fine arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art)are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the[decorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_arts)or[applied arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts).
- The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and[interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic_interpretation), are explored in a branch of philosophy known as[aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics). The resulting[artworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artworks)are studied in the professional fields of[art criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_criticism)and the[history of art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_history).

## Culture isthecustoms, arts, socialinstitutions,and achievements
of group of people regarded collectively

- Cultureis an umbrella term which encompasses the[social behaviours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior),[institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution), and[norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm)found in[human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human)[societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society), as well as the[knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge),[beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief),[arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art),[laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law),[customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm), capabilities, and[habits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit)of the individuals in these groups.
- Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location.
- Humans acquire culture through the[learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning)processes of[enculturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enculturation)and[socialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.

A[cultural norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_norm)codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behaviour, dress, language, and demeanour in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.

- Thus in military culture,[valour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage)is counted a typical behaviour for an individual and duty, honour, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the[continuum of conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_of_conflict).
- In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.

Cultural change, or repositioning, is the reconstruction of a cultural concept of a society. Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies.

Organizations like[UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO)attempt to preserve culture and cultural heritage.

- In 1922, secondsite namely Mohonjdaro discovered by R D Banerjee.
- With the discovery of IVC, it became the world's most advanced civilization.
- Its first civilization started to use aburned brick of the same size and shape.Pyramid of Egypt made from unburnt bricks.
- The Next advanced feature ofIVC was immaculate urban planning. IVC seals.

- One of the important artefacts found in Indus towns.
