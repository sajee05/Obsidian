## POVERTY

- Poverty is defined as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pronounced deprivation in wellbeing</mark> and consists of multiple dimensions
    - There is a general *deprivation* of material resources such as food, clothing, shelter etc. and at the same time there is a general deprivation of means to live a dignified life.
        - This creates a situation wherein a person may have lack of opportunity and capacity to better one’s life
    - Poverty is defined in broader terms that is deprivation on multiple dimensions of wellbeing
    - However, when it comes to measurement these multiple dimensions are difficult to measure objectively.
        - Objective measurement of poverty would mean laying down criteria to identify the poor from non-poor
        - This criterion would defer according to the person defining the criteria of what or who is poor
        - Therefore the criteria would be a **normative statement**
            - That is a statement of opinion
    - According to the criteria which are accepted a person may be categorized as poor and non –poor

**Absolute Poverty**

- When poverty is defined as measured set standards, such poverty is called absolute poverty
    - A number of experts may give their opinion, one of those may be accepted and thus it becomes the absolute standard of measuring poverty.
        - This standard will not change unless there is a revision
    - Standards make measurement of poverty objective and comparable across time and space - standards are set, poverty can be measured objectively and it can measure using the same standards at different points in time at different places and this makes it easy to compare poverty across regions and progress on poverty with time.

**Relative poverty**

- Views poverty in relative terms
    - It eliminates the need to define normative standards which may either be non - acceptable or, may not be able to capture poverty broadly
    - It is a measure of inequality
        - It sees whether a person is relatively poor wrt someone else
    - One way to measure poverty in relative terms is to simply see how many people in the country earn less than the average incomes in the country or median income in the country etc.
    - A better way to look at poverty is to simply measure the extent of inequality.

**Four basic concepts related to poverty:**

- i)Headcount ratio
    - ii)Poverty line
    - iii)poverty gap
    - iv)Squared poverty gap

**Poverty line (PL)**

- The estimated **minimum level of income needed to secure the necessities of life**.
    - Used to define/determine whether the person is poor or not.
    - It is usually based on recommendations by an expert panel constituted for this very purpose

**Headcount ratio:**

- The proportion of population below the poverty line that is those who have been determined poor according to the accepted poverty line.

**Poverty Gap**

- It is a measure of the depth of poverty
    - The depth signifies how deep below the poverty line an average person is
    - That is it measures how far from the poverty line people below the poverty line are and what is the average distance one would have to cover in order to cross over the poverty line.
    - The poverty gap measures the depth of poverty however it just measures the average distance that a person BPL had to traverse to escape poverty.
        - It didn’t differentiate between the efforts required by people.
        - who are far below the poverty line and those who are near to poverty line
    - One way of giving more weightage to the efforts of people who are far below the poverty line is to take the average of the squares of distance rather than simply the average of the distance.
        - By taking squared distances those who are further away from their deprivation will be captured to a greater extent

**Squared poverty gap:**

- Find the average of squared distances and then takes the squared roots to find the squared poverty gap
    - SPG would be more closer to people who are away from the poverty line as compared to the poverty gap which would be more closer to the poverty line.

### POVERTY MEASUREMENTS IN INDIA

**Why do we measure poverty?**

- Poverty is measured primarily to achieve two objectives
        - First, to identify a poor person/household so that targeted efforts can be undertaken to improve their conditions.
        - Secondly, to measure and see our progress on poverty alleviation.

- In pursuit of 1st objective, it is pertinent that the criteria to identify poor people be easy to implement.
        - It should be such that the undeserving non-poor should not be identified as poor whereas all deserving poor should be identified as poor.
        - It can't be very strict as strict criteria defeat the purpose of welfare.
        - Inclusion and exclusion error must be kept in mind in the poverty line estimation.
    - In pursuit of 2nd objective, the criteria can be strict because here the objective is to see the progress and not to identify a person as poor or not.
        - Strict criteria may produce a lower estimate of the number of poor people.
        - However, this will not in any way exclude a poor person from enjoying the benefit of a govt. scheme.
        - The beneficiaries for various govt. programs are mentioned in those schemes therein.
        - As there is multiple govt. programs targeting the vulnerable or the poor, Many times the beneficiaries overlap.
        - It led to the problem of redundant efforts and wastage of resources in identifying the beneficiaries.
        - Also, the deserving's are excluded and the undeserving get included.

- To overcome this problem, the govt. came out with Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC).

- **N C Saxena Committee (2010** - to identify BPL households) -> to recommend a better way to conduct the Below Poverty Line (BPL) Census in India.
        - Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) (2012) 
        - Under SECC- Govt. classified households in 3 categories:
            - **1) Automatically included**- If a household fulfils the criteria under this bracket, then it is automatically eligible as the beneficiaries of govt. programs of poverty alleviation.
            - **2) Deprived** - A household is evaluated as being deprived on various criteria mentioned in this group. 
                - The household is made eligible only for that govt. programs on which it is found to be deprived.
                - If a household is deprived to a greater extent that is deprived on criterial above threshold then it becomes eligible for most of the govt. programs. 
            - **3) Automatically Excluded**- If a household fulfils the criteria under this bracket, then it is automatically excluded from the list of beneficiaries of govt. programs of poverty alleviation.

**How to Determine/Measure/Estimate Poverty?**

- Estimating the Head-count-Ration i.e. Below Poverty Line (BPL) Households
    - Define **Poverty line i.e Set a standard** to classify poor & non-poor.
    - Apply this criterion to a sample
    - Extrapolate to regional/state/ national level.

**Evolution of poverty line in India:**

- In the pre-independence era, Dada Bhai Naoroji is considered as the pioneer in making an organized effort in the measurement of poverty in India. He estimated Poverty line to be - 3/4 of the adult jail cost of living.
    - Later on, the national planning committee, as well as authors of the Bombay plan, presented their estimates of poverty in India.
    - In the post-independence era planning commission has been the body that has been entrusted with the task
        - Under the aegis of the planning commission, various committees have estimated the poverty line in India and their basic methodology has been following:
            - Determine a poverty line basket that is a basket of goods and services that a person/household should necessarily consume in order to maintain a non-poor standard of living
                - This has been largely normative that it has been based on what the economist constructing the PLB deems poverty to be
            - The monetary value of PLB is found out - this becomes the poverty line.
        - Note : poverty line is in terms of consumption of a poverty line basket usually, PL is measured in terms of consumption expenditure and not income this is because -
            - Incomes are highly volatile especially in the poor group and are unpredictable many times
            - consumption on the other hand is more stable and known
            - people may withhold accurate income information willingly
            - NCS (national consumption survey) surveys are carried out to ascertain consumption information from people.
            - From the survey it is found out how many people are unable to consume what was determined as the poverty line that is, consumption expenditure is less than the poverty line.
            - Information from various regions and states is collated and from that national estimates are provided

- Briefly, the following committees and their recommendation are given below -

- Dandekar and Rath commission (1971)
        - Defined poverty line basket (PLB) based on calorie consumption
        - Expenditure required to acquire 2250 calories per day in a month.
        - Note: In India, the Poverty line is not calculated based on income and wealth but consumption expenditure

- Y K Alagh committee:
        - Differentiated between calorific consumption in rural and urban area
        - Rural areas: 2400 calories
        - Urban area: 2100 calories

- Lakdawala committee(1994)
        - Expanded the poverty line basket and included Food, Housing, Clothing, Transportation, and laid standards to calculate the poverty line.
        - Changes brought:
            - Expanding poverty line basket
            - Expanding poverty line to state-specific poverty line
            - How to adjust the poverty line year over year based on scientific parameters based on CPI
        - Because of the inclusion of new expanses in the PLB. Poverty line was revised upward and as a result headcount ratio increased drastically accordingly BPL population was around 45% in 1994
        - At the time of independence, about 56 % population was poor and in the 1990s, about 45 % population was poor.
        - Updating of prices with regard to CPI (IW) for urban and rural areas respectively.

- Suresh Tendulkar committee (2004):
        - Report in 2009
        - Overhauled the way in which poverty is estimated
        - It extended PLB (poverty line basket) to include those items which were conventionality not assumed to be part of PLB
        - It looked at the national consumption expenditure survey (NCES) and found out that those households which classified as poor were incurring expenses on those items which were not part of PLB
            - Expenditure on alcohol
            - Behavioural expenditure included in PLB
            - Poverty line : 4800 rupees per household per month consumption expenditure in urban areas

- Rangarajan committee (2013):
        - It was constituted to review the Tendulkar committee report and suggest some alternate ways to measure poverty
        - Divided consumption expenditure into two parts:
            - i)Normative: food and non-food expenditure
            - ii)Behavioural
        - Poverty line: 47 rupees per person per day
        - Alternate suggestion: Ability of household to save to measure poverty line.
        - It presented the Tendulkar committee's recommendations in a more organized way.

### International approaches to measuring poverty

- **World Bank’s approach -**
        - **Poverty line for countries based on income groups: GNI (per capita)**

**The World Bank classifies economies into four groups based on GNI per capita (Atlas method):**

**1.        Low-income: ≤ $1,135**

**2.        Lower-middle income: $1,136 – $4,465**

**3.        Upper-middle income: $4,466 – $13,845**

**4.        High-income: ≥ $13,846**

- **Based on extreme poverty:**
        - **Low-income Extreme Poverty as defined by World Bank - $1.90/per capita/per day**
        - **Though we can’t eliminate poverty WB says we must eliminate extreme poverty**
        - **In the year 2000, it was $1 per day (on the basis of PPP)**
            - **In 2010: $1.25 per day**
            - **In 2019: $1.9 per day**
            - **In 2022 : $2.15 per day**
        - **The focus on extreme poverty elimination is reflected through the MDGs to SDGs**

### Sustainable development goals (SDGs)

- There are 17 goals having 169 targets
    - SDG1 : elimination of extreme poverty between  2015-2030
        - Formulated by UNs

**Purchasing power parity (PPP)**

- The purchasing power of a currency means how much one unit of a currency can buy
    - PPP is a theory that simply says that in equilibrium purchasing power of different currencies would be the same
    - Take an example of the poverty line
        - 1.9 dollars per person per day is the extreme poverty line according to World Bank
        - This extreme poverty line needs to be applied to different countries respectively
        - How will $1.9 be converted to Indian currency for measurement of extreme poverty in India
        - For this, we use the PPP exchange rate
            - 1.9 dollars can buy a certain basket of goods in the USA
            - The number of Indian rupees to buy the same basket of goods in India will be a PPP value of 1.9 dollars in India
            - 1.9 dollars can’t be simply multiplied with the market exchange rate (1 dollar equals 70 Rs) to arrive at the equivalent amount of rupees needed in India
            - This is because goods in the US are generally costly due to higher standards of living
        - In India, one will need a lesser amount of money to buy the same basket of goods as it will be generally cheaper
            - Hence PPP exchange rate < market exchange rate (not always true)
            - say जो चीज़ ख़रीदने में US में 100 रुपए देने पड़ रहे थे वह India में 20 रुपए में आ जाएगी (basket mein से)
            - If there is equal inflation then PPP exchange rate will **not** change.
        - This method of converting dollars to rupees (or any other pair of currencies) where it is **not the market exchange rate that is used** but purchasing power of currencies is equated is called the PPP exchange rate
        - PPP ER are estimated by WB periodically.
            - At its simplest value of one item such as apples may be taken and equated to arrive at PPP ER
            - However, there are multiple products in an economy and their values in 2 different economies may not always be equally proportional
                - Example: Apple I phone in the USA is 1000 dollars, in India its 1 lakh rupees
                - Equating them we arrive at a PPP ER of 1 dollar = 100 Rs
                - WB carries out an elaborate exercise in which it **decides a basket of goods** and then finds and equates its values in different countries to arrive at PPP ER
            - There are simpler measures like the **Big Mac index** which measures and equates the price of Mc Donalds burger

**Measurement of poverty internationally**

- The World Bank measurement of poverty:
        - The World Bank classifies countries based on income group.
        - Every group has its own poverty line.
    - However, the world bank also measures extreme poverty which was targeted to be halved between 2000-2015 as part of millennium development goals (MDGs) and which is targeted to be eliminated by 2030 as part of sustainable development goals (SDG1).
    - Extreme poverty is defined as the poverty level in the 15 poorest counties of the world.
    - Presently its level is 1.9 dollars per person per day.
    - This 1.9 dollar is converted into domestic currencies using the PPP exchange rates.

**Indexes**

- While meaning wellbeing of a country we cannot simply rely on incomes earned in that country.
    - The other aspects of well being are:
        - Opportunity to be employed.
        - Comfort at the workplace.
        - Security of life and property.
        - Freedom in general.
        - Health
        - Education.
        - Environment.
        - Governance etc.
    - But most of these aspects are subjective in nature. however, an economist tries to measure these aspects objectively.
    - Then the economist combines these objective aspects to form an index.

- Sen index - measurement of poverty

**Human development index.**

- The human development index was developed by Amartya Sen and  Mahbub ul Haq.
    - UNDP adopted the HDI and is released every year as part of the Human Develop Report by UNDP.
    - They choose the aspect of health, education, and wealth for human development.
    - Heath was measured objectively based on the life expectancy at birth of a person.
    - Education was measured objectively by:
        - Expected year of schooling of the child before school-going age.
        - The mean year of schooling of person who has passed school-going age.
    - Wealth was measured by GNI per capita.
    - HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices of each of the three dimensions.

**Human Poverty Index (HPI):**

- also developed by the UNDP, specifically focuses on poverty and social exclusion
    - It is a non income measure for poverty
    - In 2010, it was supplanted by the UN's Multidimensional Poverty Index.

### Multidimensional poverty index.

NM

YA

H-WAGES (नरेंद्र मोदी या हाई wages)

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 1.png>)
    - It is developed by OPHI(Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative) and UNDP.
    - It measures poverty as being deprived on multiple dimensions of well-being. that is health, education, and standard of living.
    - **There are 10 indicates** with associated deprivation criteria.
        - There are 3 broad criteria: health, education, and standard of living, each with 1/3rd weightage.
        - Heath includes nutrition and child mortality.
        - Education includes years of schooling and enrolment.
        - Living standards include water, sanitation, electricity, cooking fuel, housing, and assets. (H-WAGES)
    - It measures poverty by asking questions and assessing the response to deprivation criteria.
    - If a household is found to be deprived on 3/10 criteria(MPI>0.3) then it is considered as MPI poor.
    - MPI ranges from 0-1, The higher value implies higher multidimensionally poor.
    - MPI assesses the poverty in the country from different surveys and then extrapolates that number as a national level to find out the headcount ratio of multidimensionally poor people.

**India's progress on poverty.**

- In the post-independence period for the 1st 5 decades, India's pace of poverty reduction was abysmally slow.
    - After independence in 1950, about 60% of the population was under the poverty line.
    - In 1994 it came down to 45% thus the poverty reduction happened at a slow pace.
    - The pace of poverty reduction increased only in the 90s and further in the 2000s.
        - Poverty according to Tendulkar line: 2004-05(37.2%), in 2009-10(29.8%), and in 2011-12(21.9%).
        - The increase in pace is largely attributable to a higher pace of growth.
        - There is a strong correlation between growth and poverty alleviation.
        - Every 1% increase in growth rate is associated with a 0.6% increase in the pace of poverty reduction.
    - The growth rate of the population declined and the growth rate of the economy increases leading to higher per capita increases and more resources in the hands of the government.
    - Thus higher growth created conditions in which the government had more resources to spend on poverty alleviation and to reduce vulnerabilities of the people at the bottom.
    - All measures of poverty, official estimates, world bank estimates, MPI estimates point to the fact that India has uplifted millions out of poverty at a record pace.
    - However a considerable reduction in poverty, there is still a long way to go before the poor are actually insulated from various dimensions of deprivation.
    - India is now a low-middle-income country, at its income level, the poverty line is 3.2 dollars/ person/day, whereas the official poverty line is still coincidentally, close to 1.9 dollars/person/day.
    - At 3.2 dollars the estimated headcount ratio is about 40% whereas at 1.9 dollars it is around 6-8%.
        - This showed that despite uplifting people out of poverty most of them have only barely been uplifted and continue to remain vulnerable.
        - The government support to this section thus cannot merely be withdrawn because these people are no longer officially poor.
        - It must continue to make them capable in order to sustainably shield themself from falling back in the poverty.

# Inequality

- It is when two sets of people possess different levels of resources.
    - Most commonly inequality is seen in **3 dimensions**
        - Consumption.
        - Income.
        - Wealth.

- Okun's law: states relationship between unemployment and GDP growth, it predicts that 1% rise in unemployment will usually be associated with 2% drop in GDP.
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 2.png>)
    - consumption rise at a slower pace as compared to a rise in income.
    - Inequality is usually measured through consumption as data of income and wealth is more inaccurate.

**REASONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF INEQUALITY**

Economic Reasons

- Market Forces : Free-market economies inherently generate unequal outcomes, with individuals rewarded based on their skills, abilities, and resources.

Social Reasons

Discrimination: Prejudice and bias based on race, gender, ethnicity, disability limits opportunities and perpetuate inequality.

Technological factors: new technology can displace workers and exacerbate inequalities

**Conventional Reasons**

- Natural advantages that a place, a person, a community, may enjoy over the others.
    - Many times accidents of birth or location give advantages that might not be comprehensible to senses but over a period of time manifests themselves through large inequality.

**Comparative advantages**

- Many times similarly endowed places or people may not end up in a similar state rather there may be developed inequalities amongst them too.
    - Amongst two similar places possession similar natural resources, one may be favoured due to a policy or some other very small advantage.
    - This small advantage may result in the kicking off of a growth process which may even consume the natural resources or natural advantages of the other place.

**Differential return on capital and labour**

- It has been seen that profits are enjoyed almost completely by the entrepreneur whereas the workers get meagre wages.
    - This has been the dominant explanation of inequality since Karl Marx described the perils of the industrial revolution.

**Curse of resources**

- Many times it is believed that the existence of resources at a place is a curse hindering its development. 
    - Examples of backwardness of Africa, Eastern India vis-a-vis western India, pre-industrial China, vis-a-vis Korean and Japan. 
    - It is believed that resources attract corruption, foreigners lead to unstable political conditions. 
    - However, the curse of resources is rather a shallow concept, the backwardness of Africa is due to difficulty in extracting the present resources, scattered existence of resources. 
    - Resources at other places, for example, the Ruhr region of Germany, the UK, the Northern mineral belt of the USA, Australia, and post-industrial China have been the reasons for the rapid development of these regions.
    - Even amongst Africa, iron ore and coal are found together only in a few places, prominently in south Africa which coincidently is the most developed country in that region. 

**Modern Economic reasons for inequality** 

- The modern explanation of inequality is based on the concept of rule of law.
    - It is now generally accepted that poor and differential application of rule of law perpetuates inequality.
    - One way in which it materializes is the anticompetitive behaviour of the firms.
    - In the long run, the rate of return of a firm's capital return as well as the returns earned by workers in form of wages is equal.
        - However, firms earned exceptional returns and workers earned only average returns.
    - The overall returns earned by all the firms are not very high as compared to workers.
        - However. most of the firms are at losses and eventually shut down.
        - Therefore, the returns, that were supposed to be earned by a large number of firms are earned only by a handful.
    - It has been seen that out of 100 firms which start only 10 survive beyond 10 years. 
        - Therefore, the returns earned by 10 firms are those which could have been distributed amongst 100 firms. 
        - Hence, existing firms earn exceptional returns.
    - On the other hand, the size of the labour pool remains relatively constant with respect to population
        - Therefore, the entire amount of wages are always distributed amongst a set of similar size of workers. 
        - Therefore labour will not earn exceptional returns rather only average returns. 
    - Since the firms know that having lesser competition will lead to more returns, therefore, they indulge in practices for example policies of the government may be influenced by a few firms leading to large entry barriers for others. 
        - This favourable policymaking is a feature of developing economies transitioning from a socialist form of government to a market-led economy. 
        - This is not to say that developed countries will not make policies favourable to a set of few companies.
        - However, the application of rule of law is more fair and transparent in those countries, and therefore the possibility of extracting favours from the government is less.

**MEASURES OF INEQUALITY**

**Lorenz Curve**

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics.jpeg>)
    - It depicts the distribution of wealth in the population.
    - This representation is done by plotting the distribution of cumulatively held wealth by a proportion of the population.
    - The zero-percent population will always hold zero percent wealth and 100% population will always hold 100% wealth.
    - However, between these two points, if a different proportion of wealth is held by a lower proportion of the population, that would imply that the remaining population holds a lesser proportion of wealth.

**Gini Co-efficient**

- It is a statistical measure of inequality that is calculated using the Lorenz curve. 
        - A/A+B.
            - A = Area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve. (Inequality gap)
            - B = Area between perfect inequality and Lorenz curve.
        - The value of the Gini coefficient varies from 0- 1.
            - Zero being no inequality and 1 being completed inequality.
            - As can be seen from the formula, a country with perfectly equal distribution will have a Lorenz curve overlapping the line of perfect equality.
            - Hence, A would be zero, therefore. co-efficient will also be zero.
            - Similarly, for a country with a completely unequal distribution.
                - The Lorenz curve will overall line of perfect inequality.
                - Therefore, B would be zero and hence Gini coefficient would be 1.

**Inequality in India**

- In India, officially, the Gini coefficient is calculated from the NCES.
    - The last **NCES** was carried in 2011 when the Gini coefficient was calculated to be 0.36.
    - It had increased from the previous measurement of 0.28.
    - Other estimates of inequality from reputed NGOs like Oxfam international and from institutions like the world bank all point out the increasing trend of inequality.
    - 74 million tax returns were filed in AY 2022-23. of this 51.6 million had zero tax liability.
        - 5.2% file income tax returns
        - 1.6% people pay income tax

**Kuznets curve**

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 3.png>)

- It is a theoretical expectation of change in a particular variable with respect to economic growth.
    - It is an inverted U-shaped curve that predicts that initially, that particular variable will increase with economic growth then stabilize, and then eventually start falling. 
    - For example - there is the Kuznets curve for inequality, environmental Kuznets's curve, etc.
    - Inequality Kuznets's curve shows that with the rise in incomes (increasing economic growth), initially inequality in a country will increase, then stabilize, and then eventually decrease. 
    - It is merely a theoretical prediction. 
    - It doesn't tell anything about at what levels of income will inequality stop increasing and start declining. 
    - Other example - environment Kuznets curve, etc.

### CORRECTING INEQUALITY

**Models of growth**

- Inequality is a natural process of growth processes.
    - Growth implies that in some regions, few people grow at a faster pace than others, producing inequalities. 
    - In order to reduce inequality, we endeavour that the growth process is as broad-based as possible.
    - Since the resources with the country and government are limited, therefore they will have to be used in a manner that produces the best possible outcome. 

**Trickle-down approach to the growth** 

- For the longest time, it was believed, that the best possible outcome would be achieved through the process of focusing resources in those regions, sectors which had high potential for growth. 
    - Such regions/sectors were expected to grow fast and their benefits were supposed to be trickled down to other deprived regions or sectors. 
    - States that tax breaks and benefits for corporations and the wealthy will trickle down to everyone else. It argues for income and capital gains tax breaks or other financial benefits to large businesses, investors, and entrepreneurs to stimulate economic growth.

- In this model, the people at the bottom are passive beneficiaries of the fruits of growth.
    - This is certainly a pro-poor approach to growth.
    - However, the benefits to the poor are dependent on
        - The extra resources are collected by the government.
        - Will of the government to distribute those resources to the poor.
        - The efficiency of resource redistribution.
    - Drawbacks to this approach are corrected by an inclusive approach to growth.

**An inclusive approach to growth.**

- The inclusive model of growth is **broad-based** in the sense that those at the bottom are not passive recipients but also active contributors to the growth process.
    - Thereby, their fate is not just in the government's hands or is dependent on the ability of the top to grow.
    - Inclusive growth focus on making the bottom skilled, able, and confident enough to assume the risks in the job market as the government takes care of their social vulnerabilities.
    - IG involves the enhancement of skills, government provision of basic services like health and education, creation of such jobs through industrial development where the people at the bottom can find reasonable job opportunities.
    - The focus is on the most deprived, vulnerable groups and the most backward regions to correct inequalities.
    - An ability to earn for themselves through a dignified job reduces poverty, improves the standard of living, and thus may lead to a reduction of inequalities.

# UNEMPLOYMENT

- It is a situation wherein a person who is willing to work is unable to find work.

**Terms**

**Labour force participation rate** 

- Expressing the number of persons in the labour force as a percentage of the working-age population.
    - The total population in the cohort.
    - LFPR is a key metric to see what is the level of economic engagement that the population of the country gets into.

**Unemployment rate (UR)**

- Total unemployed/total labour force.
    - The unemployed are measured only amongst those who are seeking work.
    - The proportion of the labour force that is unable to get work is called unemployed.

**Dependency ratio**

- Dependent population/total population.
    - A dependent population is defined as those who are not in the working-age group.
    - Working age is usually defined as 16-64 years (sometimes 18-60 as well).

**Worker population ratio**

- Total employed persons/total population multiplied by 1000.
    - The worker population ratio is a statistic used to measure the proportion of a population that is actively employed in the workforce.

**Demographic dividend**

- The benefit that a country expects to reap from its favourable demographic structure.
    - A favourable demographic structure is one that comprises the youthful working population.
    - The youth are energetic, adaptive to be skilled, have the ability to work longer, thereby, the productivity of the labour force would be high when it is youthful.
    - As compared to aging countries, the productivity of such countries would be higher, and thus such countries should be able to attract more firms and thus gain economically and socially.
    - This expected gain is the demographic dividend.
    - DD is only expected to gain, it is not a guarantee, rather if the youthful energies are not channelized then the dividend may turn into a disaster.

### Measurement of unemployment

**NSSO Approach of measuring unemployment**

- A survey is conducted with a questionnaire.
    - Based on these questions (approx. 120) it is decided if someone is part of the labour force or not.

**Status**

- If in the work labour force or not.
    - Whether employed or unemployed. 
    - Neither seeking nor available to work.

**3 approaches**

- **Usual principal status -** Status of activity on which a person has spent in last year.
    - **Current weekly status -** Status of activity for one week, preceding the week of survey.
        - Employed If they worked for at least one hour on at least one day during the preceding week of survey.
    - **Current daily Status -** Engagement and intensity of engagement on each day of the reference week
        - Employed: If they worked for at least 4 hours on a particular day.
        - Useful for studying underemployment and hidden unemployment.

**Measurement of Unemployment in India.**

- Unemployment is measure through surveys carried out by various agencies such as NSSO (Government estimates, CMIE (Centre for monitoring of Indian economy, a private organization conducting its own independent surveys), RBI.

**The approach of the survey process.** 

- A sample is laid down i.e., households representing diverse socio-economic and geographic conditions are identified for surveying. 
    - A questionnaire is prepared to ascertain the responses based on which the following status is described to each individual surveyed.
    - Weather in the labour force or not.
        - If Yes, then whether employed or not.
        - If No,  the neither seeking nor willing for work.
    - The information is collected and compiled and on the basis of this unemployment rate of various sections (cohorts) and a combined unemployment rate at the regional and national level is estimated.

**NSSO's Approach**

- There are 3 different approaches that NSSO uses for the estimation of the unemployment rate.

**Usual principal status approach (UPS)**

- In this approach the principle and the subsidiary status of a person with respect to employment are determined.
    - It is based on, the majority of time criteria.
        - First, a person is considered to be part of the labour force if he/she was in the labour force for a majority of the time in the previous year (more than 182 days).
            - If he was able to find work for that period, he is considered to be principally employed.
            - Those who are unable to find work for a majority of the time as mentioned above would be considered unemployed.
            - However, many amongst them may have found work for at least one month.
                - Some people are considered to be subsidiarily employed.

**Current weekly status (CWS)**

- It measures unemployment on the basis of the criteria that he was able to get any work for at least 1 hour on any one day of the previous week.
    - CWS measures unemployment which may be seasonal in nature. For example, agriculture labour or a painter, or construction worker may be able to find work for a majority of the time that they were in the labour force in the past 1 year. 
        - But, in months where their specific economic activity is not in action, they may either not find any work, or worse even drop out of the labour force.
        - Such unemployment and even the period for which they dropped out of the labour force will not be captured in the usual status approach.
    - But, may probably be captured in the CWS approach.
    - The new PLFS(Periodic LFS) only uses the US and CWS criteria to measure unemployment.
    - The earlier EUS(employment-unemployment survey) also used the current daily status (CDS) approach for unemployment measurement.

**Current Daily Status (CDS)**

- CDS measure unemployment based on the intensity of employment.
    - A person is deemed to be employed with 100% intensity if he was able to work for more than 4 hours on a particular day. 
    - If he works for less than 4 hours but more than 1 hour, then his employment intensity is only 50%, otherwise, for less than 1 hour, it is zero.
    - Based on a person's response it is calculated that out of the maximum available time (intensity) for how much time (intensity) did a person actually work.

**Types of unemployment**

- Types of unemployment's should be studied as reasons explaining unemployment. 
    - This allows us to view unemployment as being caused by multiple factors at once.

- Unemployment as explained by the macroeconomics school of thought.

CONCEPT OF DEMAND AND SUPPLY

**Demand**

- Demand is the willingness and ability of a consumer to buy a particular thing at a point in time at a particular price.
    - **Law of demand**
        - The demand for a product decreases with an increase in price and vice-versa, keeping other things constant. 
    - **Supply** 
        - Supply is the amount of a resource that firms/producers are willing and able to provide to the marketplace or to an individual.

**Law of supply**

- The supply of products will increase with the increase in price and vice versa, **Ceteris Paribus (** keeping other things constant).

- **Classical unemployment**
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 5.png>)
        - Classical UE is also called wage rate UE.
        - Classical economists explained unemployment in an economy as arising from higher than the equilibrium wage rates. 
        - They argued that if wage rates in the economy have been artificially set at a level that is greater than the equilibrium wage rate then the number of people willing to supply their labour i.e., labour force will be higher than the number of people that the firms are willing to hire.
        - At equilibrium wage rate, no one who is willing to employ someone would not have fulfilled its demand. 
        - Hence, there would have been no unemployment.

- **The Keynesian school** 
        - Central belief: Markets are imperfect and prone to economic fluctuations. Government intervention is necessary to stabilize the economy.

**The natural rate of employment**

- According to Keynesian explanation, unemployment exists due to the cyclical nature of the economy.
    - Even when the cyclical factors are removed i.e., the effect of cyclical factors which is a fluctuating GDP is taken away, even then, there would exist some unemployment in the economy, this is called the non-cyclical rate of unemployment or background rate of unemployment. 

**Cyclical unemployment** 

- An economy goes through periods of high and low growth, it cannot be perpetually in a state of equilibrium
    - The GDP increases at a fast pace during the time of high growth whereas it may slow down or even contract when there is negative growth.
    - Output is produced using factors of production and output grows either when more factors of production are employed or when the productivity of existing factors of production increases.
    - During periods of low growth, it can be said that new factors of production employed would be less than the number employed during periods of high growth.
    - As such during the periods of high growth more jobs are created and hence unemployment is less.
    - On the other hand during the period of slow down fewer jobs would be created and hence unemployment would be high.
    - The extra unemployment which exists in the economy during times of slowdown is called cyclical unemployment.
    - Normally, the economy would come back to its average growth rate and hence this extra unemployment would fall.

**Keynesian explanation**

- Keynesian explanation to unemployment is relevant for the periods when the cyclical unemployment doesn't seem to get back to normal because the economy may be in a period of sustained slowdown. 
    - It is especially relevant during periods of a prolonged recession i.e., a contraction in GDP where the output of the firms declines rather than simply growing slowly. 
    - During times of recession when the output falls the firms have unutilized spare capacity.
    - In such times when the firm's output has decreased, the firm may increase its output back to its capacity level without employing any new factors of production.
    - More often the firm will not even have the need, to increase its output to normal levels.
    - Even if people are ready to work at low wages the firm will not employ any additional factor of production because there isn't nay enough demand.
    - The only reason for the firm to employ new factors of production would be if there are additional demands which require expansion of its production capacity I.e., requires new investment.
    - Since there is no additional demand, at the same time because the economy is stuck in recession therefore there is no foreseeable increase in demand.
    - Therefore, the firm will choose not to invest. 
    - Hence, the economy may be stuck in this cycle for the long term and hence we are stuck at high levels of unemployment eventually.
    - The Keynesian solution to unemployment is that if households do not increase their demand (because of the high level of unemployment and low wages).
    - Firms will not invest and therefore the only source where additional demand can come from is the government.
    - The government expenditure would increase the demand for firms' output and therefore eventually more investment can take place thus creating more employment.

**Unemployed as explained in an economy**

**Structural unemployment** 

- Structural unemployment occurs when there's a mismatch between the skills workers possess and the skills demanded by employers.
    - UE may exist because of structural reasons. 
    - Causes
        - A structural reason is a dominant factor/characteristic for example an economy characterized by the automobile industry will face unemployment if there is a change in the automobile production process (from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles or shift of automobile industry to some other place due to globalization.
        - Similarly, structural unemployment may exist, when the industrial demand in terms of the skill of workers changes - the workers may have skills that are no longer relevant and thus makes them unemployable despite a demand for work by the industry.

**Frictional unemployment**

- It refers to the temporary phase of being unemployed while actively searching for a new job or transitioning between jobs.
    - Unemployment may also exist due to the inefficiency of the labour market. 
    - If the information regarding the availability of jobs is not available to labour despite both the presence of job as well as the presence of required skill for the job, then a person may remain unemployed due to lack of information.
    - Such unemployment because of the inefficiency of the labour market is called frictional unemployment.
    - It is commonly referred to as the time spent between switching jobs.

**Seasonal Unemployment**

- There might be jobs that have seasonal characteristics.
    - Such jobs due to the seasonal nature of the sector, they are in would be available only at certain specific times of the year.
    - At other times people who are in such jobs would be unemployed.

**Voluntary unemployment**

- Many times a person may choose not to deliberately accept an offered job. 
    - It can be due to -
        - A) The wages offered are not attractive.
        - B) The job is deemed to be below dignity or the skill level.
        - C) The unemployment benefits offered by the government may be quite generous etc.

**Unemployment, explained by the intensity of work**

- Unemployment in which the capability of a person is not fully utilised.
    - Generally, a person who would like to work more but work is not available, is said to be underemployed.
    - Ex- A Ph.D. qualified to work as class 4 teacher or a person willing to work for 8 hours but offered work only for 4 hours. 

**Disguised Employment**

- It is a situation in which the additional output contributed by a worker is zero.
    - It is a situation in which more people than what is required are employed to do a job.
    - These extra workers essentially do not contribute anything and are therefore employed but in a disguised manner.

**Concepts of wages**

- **Minimum Wage**
        - Minimum wage is a legal/ statutory enacted wage rate.
        - It is the wage rate that has been prescribed and is legally enforced to be the minimum amount of hourly wage that would be paid to a person-specific to the skill level of the job. 
        - Floor wage - It is a minimum overall wage irrespective to skill level, i.e., it is the minimum wage that has to be paid to any person irrespective of where and what work they do.
            - Every state has minimum wages with respect to different jobs according to the skill level of each job.
        - The items in the 7th schedule which fall under the domain of central government (list 1), minimum wages in those areas/sectors are set by the central government.
        - Minimum wages are set by the government by taking into account various factors. 
        - The two important factors are living wage and fair wage.

**Living wage**

- It is considered as a wage necessary to have a minimum decent standard of living.

**Fair wage**

- The minimum wage may be very subjective and therefore be calculated at quite high levels.
    - If the government keeps the minimum wage around the fair wage level then wages may become too high disincentivizing employment.
    - Therefore, a fair wage is also calculated which takes into account the employer's perspective as well as the effect that wages may have on employment.

**Employment Elasticity**

- It is a measure of the percentage change in employment associated with a 1 percentage point change in economic growth. The employment elasticity indicates the ability of an economy to generate employment opportunities for its population as per cent of its growth (development) process.
    - Falling employment elasticity is partly the result of a large-scale substitution of labour with capital and automation.
    - It is an easy decision for promoters to use capital and automation when labour is heavily regulated in the economy.
    - Agriculture is no longer supporting half the population, and the fresh pressure on jobs is becoming apparent from rural to urban migration in search of employment.

- Relationship of employment to GDP
        - How much employment has increased by the increase in GDP
        - It has continued to decrease in our country while GDP grew
        - The growth in GDP is due to employee(Workforce) productivity rather than due to an increase in employment
        - this has resulted in **Jobless growth**
        - that is when employment has grown but the pace of growth has been abysmally low
        - **Employment elasticity is decreasing that is less number of jobs created per unit of GDP growth**

- **Reconciliation:**
        - where there is a low skilled workforce, there are more jobs
        - where there is a high skilled workforce, there are lesser jobs
        - The low skilled workforce desire the higher-skilled jobs generated and that is why there is a mismatch
        - Inadequacy of required skills is the characteristic of India's job market
        - So structural and voluntary unemployment exist in India, and this explains the paradox.
        - Skill mismatch explains the nature of unemployment in India
        - Unemployment by itself is not an issue in India, voluntary unemployment is
            - voluntary one do not aspire for the jobs available, structurally(required skill is not available in persons) one is unfit for these jobs

**Formal-Contractual-Informal Employment**

- **Formal & Informal v/s Organised & Unorganised:**
        - The terms are used, mostly right, interchangeably. However, there is a subtle difference.
        - **Organized & Unorganised** are features of an enterprise whereas **formal and informa**l are features of employment. 
        - **An enterprise’s setup is (un)organized:**
            - Meaning that whether the position and role of everyone are clearly defined or not
            - Is there a defined path that an employee will take to progress?
            - Is there a standard process which the company follows in its dealings or recruitments, etc?

### 4 labour law codes:

- **Governing specific aspects of employee-employer relation**
    - **WIWS**
        - code on wages
        - codes on social security
        - codes on industrial relation
        - codes on worker safety

### Employment types

- An employee’s nature of employment is formal/informal

- **Formal employment:**
        - Has certain recognition of rights
        - security of protection of the right
        - certain minimum paid leave
        - prior information of any pay cuts etc.
        - ability to enforce these rights is higher
        - If the employee has a definite contract that confers certain rights over him, then employment is said to be formal.

- **For example:**
        - Does he have the right to paid leaves/maternity leaves?
        - Or a reasonable certainty of a salary hike?
        - Does he receive the salary on the company payroll?
        - Is salary shown by the company to the government and tax deducted on it?
        - All these are features of formal employment.

- There is no list of features that grant an absolute status of formality. It is merely seen from the rights available to the employee. Theoretically, if the company recognizes someone to be their employee in eyes of the government, the employee will automatically get all the rights that he is eligible for under various labour laws.
    - There is no discretion here for the company. It only has the discretion to go beyond what is minimally required – such as giving a fair wage instead of minimum wage, etc. 

- **Informal employment:**
        - No formal recognition of rights by employer
        - Theoretically has all these rights but the ability to enforce these rights is less
        - An informal employee, thus, necessarily means who does not get such rights because he is not formally recognized by the company

- **Contractual employment**
        - Some rights are given by the employer
        - based on contract conditions of work, time is defined
        - Time and job bound
        - A contractual employee lies somewhere midway.
        - He has more rights than informal but less than a formal employee.
        - The company takes the labour services of the person and gives certain rights to him, but does not recognize that person as a full-time worker with the company.
        - As such, the obligations of the company wrt such employees are less as compared to a full-time employee.

- **Fixed-term employment(FTE)**
        - it can be seen as a mix of contractual and formal employment.
        - Employment, in general, is not bound by time - You are employed for life, unless, of course, either you choose to leave or the company fires you or it shuts down.
        - FTE is a type of employment wherein a person is employed for a fixed term - he enjoys all the benefits/rights that a regular employee does but only till the time he is employed, which is pre-defined.
        - Obviously, it can be extended

- **Employment in India is characterized by:**
        - The highest share of the informal, lowest share of formal, and a growing/medium share of contractual employment
        - informal is decreasing, the share of formal and contractual both is increasing, however contractual is increasing at a faster pace
        - jobs which are being converted from informal is converted more in contractual nature

- **Contractualisation of the workforce:**
        - Total formal employment in the economy increased from 8% in 2011- 12 to 10% in 2017-18.
        - During the 2011-18 period, 2.62 crore new jobs were created among regular wages/salaried employees.
        - Female participation in the labour workforce declined, especially in rural areas.
        - While total employment in organized manufacturing (registered under the Factories Act of 1948) increased from 77 Lakhs in 2000-01 to 1.37 Crore in 2015-16, more than half of this increase was because of the increase in contract workers.
        - Their share increased sharply from 15.5%  in 2000-01 to 27.9% in 2015-16 - as per the **Annual Survey of Industries   
            (ASI)**
        - Contract workers can be fired easily, have little or no job security, and far fewer benefits in terms of health, welfare, and social security compared to directly employed workers (though not necessarily permanent ones).

**Reasons for Contractualisation:**

- Cost Reduction : lower wages and benefits compared to regular employees.
    - Flexibility : scale their workforce up or down quickly 
    - Avoiding Regulation :
    - **The rigidity of labour laws:**
        - multiple statutes with state-level variation disincentivize industry to be labour-intensive and rather being capital intensive, also to hire non-permanent staff.
    - Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) wherein there is a lack of **flexibility** (i.e. government involvement is there) to deal with labour issues is seen as the biggest impediment.
    - **Size of firms is still small –** Most firms are MSMEs. MSMEs are not employment-intensive. Their size is small and thus employed persons per unit is very small.

- **Other reasons:**
        - Lower wages paid to contract workers. However, the wage gap has substantially closed during the last decade.
        - The presence of contract workers enables the management to reduce the bargaining power of the regular workers regarding wages.
        - Subsidies provided to capital augmentation may also contribute to reducing the relative cost of w.r.t. labour.
        - The incentive to get reskilled - productivity difference
    - Lower wages and benefits
    - Flexibility in hiring and firing
    - Avoidance of employee regulations
    - Access to specialized skills

**Generic steps to create more employment**

- Improving employability : skilling is the most important intervention
    - Reducing the cost of compliance with labour laws
    - Supply-side measures to augment economic growth investment, infrastructure, enhancing productivity-improving actual ease of doing business.
    - Focus on champion sectors - growth, employment, and export intensive such as textiles and food processing, etc.
    - Schemes such as PLI.

**Sectoral Share in unemployment**

- Most part of India's economy from the point of view of the output is services-based. 
    - Whereas from the point of view of employment about 45% of our workforce is employed in agriculture and related activities.
    - This contrasting situation is explained through the transition of the economy from primarily agricultural-based to services.
    - Agriculture is employment-intensive especially when the average landholding is small preventing farmers to switch over to mechanized agriculture. 
    - Services on the other hand are productivity intensive i.e., most of the output can be explained with the help of high productivity.
    - Industry's share in employment and output is virtually constant meaning that most of the share of agriculture that has declined has been appropriated by services.
    - Since the share of industry in employment is also almost constant and services are less employment-intensive, the labour from agriculture has not been absorbed anywhere else.
    - Therefore remains underemployed or disguisedly employed in agriculture.

**Contractualisation of Labour Force**

- An employer is expected to provide all the statutory rights and benefits to all its employees.
    - However, there are some workers who work for the employer but are not on the payrolls of the company.
    - These workers are said to be informally employed.
    - Informal employment means that the workers have less ability to enforce the rights that they are legally entitled to.
    - They can be fired easily, do not receive benefits like paid leaves, contribution in their provident funds by the employer, etc. 
    - On the other extreme are workers who enjoy most of the rights and importantly have the ability to enforce all their statutory rights. 
    - These are formal employees.
    - A formal employee is costly _i.e.,_ the employer bears a higher cost. It is not just a higher salary but the compliance cost and other associated costs as well.
    - A formal employee will receive costly training, benefits such as paid leaves, HRA, paid maternity leave, etc. 
    - A company is willing to attract the best talent available in the market through lucrative offers. 
    - However, for an average employee doing the redundant task. The company may deem the associated cost of hiring a formal employee to be too high. 
    - In such cases, it may go for offering such jobs on a contractual basis. 
    - A contractual job is a mid-way between informal and formal jobs. 
    - It has certain guaranteed rights and at the same time not as many costs that are associated with a formal job.
    - If the associated costs of hiring a formal employee increase then employers/industries may prefer to hire workers on a contractual basis, this is called Contractualisation of the workforce.
    - In India, the complexities of labour laws have resulted in company's preferring to hire workers on a contractual basis.
    - **The recent reforms with respect to the codification of labour laws into four codes (code on wages(W), code on industrial relations(IR), code on social security(SS) and code on safety and conditions at work(SC)).**
    - Codification of labour law is expected to reduce the compliance burden and therefore incentivise employers to hire more workers on a regular basis.

**Gig Economy**

- Gig Economy refers to that economy where the conventionally understood relationship between worker and employer has changed.
    - In this those who are working are not employees but rather referred to as through various names such as partners.
    - The employer is basically the platform provider enabling the employee to provide his services.
    - The employer takes some commission and the employee is paid for the services provided.
    - There is no fixed "salary" for the employee and there is easy mobility for the employees between one platform to another - performing his gig from one platform provider to another.

**Reasons for Contractualisation**

- Along with complex labour laws, there are other reasons as well for Contractualisation.
        - Higher compliance costs with other laws such as environmental and tax laws affecting the ability to pay to formal workers.
    - Structure of Indian economy - firms in India are characterised by their small size. Small firms do not generate jobs. It is the firm that grows big which generate jobs.
    - Small firms at best provide self-employment rather than generating more jobs.
    - One of the reasons for the firm structure being skewed towards a large number of small firms is the perverse incentive to remain small.
    - Small firms have fewer compliance requirements, less tax burden, greater subsidies etc. 
    - Therefore, they have an incentive to remain small.

**Generic steps to improve employment**

- Given the structural and voluntary reasons explaining most of the unemployment, the biggest step that can be taken is to skill the workforce in industry-relevant skills.
    - To create more jobs compliance costs would have to be reduced and most importantly supply-side measures including ease of doing business would have to be addressed.

# Some basic concepts in Economics

**Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)**

- is a graphical representation of the different maximum combinations of two goods or services an economy can produce with its given resources and technology.
    - It illustrates the fundamental economic concept of scarcity: resources are limited, so producing more of one good necessarily means producing less of another.

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 8.png>)

- A country has a limited amount of resources. Those resources can be utilised in multiple ways with the best efficiencies. 
    - Optimal use of those resources tells us what is the maximum possible output which can be produced using those limited resources.
    - A country's PPF is a graphical representation of what is the best possible use of a country's limited resources. 
    - PPF captures the concept of scarcity, choice, trade-offs.
    - There can be multiple optimal outputs.
    - A country makes a choice of what combination of goods will be produced using that limited resource.
    - Any combination of goods that is less than this optimal combination is certainly possible but undesirable due to suboptimal utilisation of resources.
    - Any combination greater than the optimal combination is desirable but not possible.
    - For example - if a country can produce either of the following three combinations.
        - A = 100 chairs, 0 tables.
        - B = 0 chairs, 50 tables.
        - C = 50 chairs,2 tables.
        - By using limited resources optimally than an output of 80 chairs, 0 tables are undesirable whereas the output of 100 chairs and 20 tables is impossible.

**PPF of a country**

- PPF represents the potential output that is what can be produced using limited resources.
    - On the other hand, there is actual data on how much a country actually produces.
    - Economists advise about what can be done to reduce the gap between actual output.
    - The actual output of the country depends upon the number of available resources and the efficiency of their utilization.
    - When the number of available resources and the technology to use them increases/improves, then a country's PPF expands i.e., it shifts outwards. 
    - For example - America's PPF in the 2000s is far ahead of America's PPF in the 1990s or any year before that. 
    - Hence, usually, the PPF of a country is always increasing (i.e., until new resources are being found or technology to utilize existing resources improves).
    - Also, we can compare the difference between the PPF and its actual output level of different countries given the level of resources and technology.
    - A developing country's distance from its PPF is expected to be higher because of its less ability to utilize its resources efficiently.
    - A developed country on the other hand is expected to be at a level of production which is closer to its PPF.
    - PPF represents the idea that there is some optimum level of output that a country can produce using its limited resources.
    - If it produces less than its optimal level then there is a scope of improvement.

**Marginal/Opportunity cost**

**Marginal cost**

- MC is the cost of producing one more unit of output.
    - It is generally expressed in the units of the limited resource. Ex- Time or money.

**Opportunity cost**

- Opportunity cost refers to the benefit foregone while choosing one optimal combination of output over some other.
    - OC is usually expressed in units of the foregone benefit that is the lesser amount of output that will be produced of a particular good if some other scenario is chosen in which the other good is produced in more quantity and this good in less.
    - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 9.png>)

**Evolution of economics school of thought**

- Decisions with respect to utilization of limited resources have economic as well as political context to them. 
    - The political context manifests itself in the form of the nature of the state i.e., how are the decisions taken with respect to utilizing limited resources to satisfy maximum wants of maximum people.
    - At the one end is a state where such decisions are centralized in an authority.
    - Such an authority can be a democratically elected government or a dictator or a committee of people having the authority to make decisions for the people.
    - Such an economy is sometimes called a command and control economy and the state is called a socialist state.
    - On the other hand, is a free-market economy also called a capitalist economy in which the economic decisions are taken by individuals as a matter of right.
    - They make decisions according to what they themselves deem to be in their best self-interest.
    - The state plays a minimalistic role in regulation.
    - In a socialist economy, the government may not have the capability or the resources, or the will to meet the demands of everyone in the economy.
    - It may choose to outsource the utilization of certain resources to the private sector as such the private sector may not essentially have a right to use resources and take economic decisions.
    - It may just have been delegated that right to make those decisions due to the inability of the authority.
    - Such economies are sometimes called mixed economies.

**Evolution of economic thinking**

- Before the mid-1700s, economic thinking was largely the domain of requirements of the state, economic decisions were taken by the king/authority with the primary objective of maintaining military to expand boundaries so that more tax could be collected.
        - और अधिक राज्य की सीमा बढ़े ताकी अधिक जनो को लूट सके।
    - Adam Smith, organized economic thinking with an idea of lais.sez-faire state in which he proposed that economic decisions should be left to the market and the state should let businesses do business.
    - Over a period of time, this thinking took the form of what was called the classical school of economics.
    - In the 1930s during the great depression, classical economics could not provide immediate solutions to the suffering of people.
    - The Keynesian school developed as opposition and vouched for government intervention during such times.
    - The Keynesian school was based on government spending.
    - Excess government spending leads to inflation at the same time government spending would have to be financed either from taxes or borrowings.
    - Any entity even the government has a limited capacity to borrow.
    - In case the growth of the economy is largely coming from government spending then if the government is not able to continue its spending the growth may immediately collapse leading to twin problems of high inflation as well as a collapsing economy (stagflation).
    - In the 1960s American economy witnessed a stagflationary situation and then a school of thought inspired from the classical school called the **monetarist school emerged.**
    - It advocated for a minimalist role for the state especially the monetary authority i.e., control over how much money was circulating in the economy.
    - In the 70s and 80s welfare states emerged. 
        - A welfare state was a that state assumed many responsibilities for its citizens especially it assumed social responsibilities in form of expenditure on education and healthcare.
        - However, when a state assumes one set of social responsibilities then it acts as a slippery slope to turn the state into a maximal state in which the state tries to interfere more and more in the name of social responsibilities.
    - In the 90s a new branch of economics called behavioural economics emerged in which the economic decisions are improved by incorporating people's behaviour.
    - The behaviour of the customers or the beneficiaries acts as a guide to improve the efficiency of economic decisions.
    - Also, since the 90s economies have become more and more integrated, and therefore economic decisions try to incorporate international aspects especially of co-operation more prominently than before.

**BASIC CONCEPT IN ECONOMICS**

**Concept of Market**

- A market is a physical or virtual place where buyers and sellers interact to indulge in the exchange of goods and services at a mutually agreeable price.
    - The price is the value of the good or service that the buyer thinks is just and the seller thinks is reasonable for him to make decent profits and remain in business.

**The law of Demand**

- The demand for a good refers to the willingness of a buyer to purchase it at a given price.
    - Demand does not mean desire.
    - Demand is expressed willingness i.e. if the buyer is offered the good at or below a particular price then he will buy it.
    - Demand depends on multiple factors. Such as the price of the good, price of related goods such as substitute or complementary goods, Disposable income, season, tastes and cultural preferences, population, etc.

- The law of demand states that ceteris paribus i.e., keeping all other things equal, demand is inversely proportional to price, i.e., when the price of a good increase the quantity demanded of that good decreases and vice-versa.

**Demand schedule/Curve**

- The demand curve is a downward-sloping curve with price (the independent variable) on Y-axis and quantity (dependent variable) on the X-axis.

**The shift of demand Curve**

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 10.png>)
    - The demand curve represents the relationship between price and quantity while keeping all other factors that determine demand as constant.
    - Some of these factors may change and thus the demand for the good at every price point would be different than before.
    - Under the new conditions, the relationship between price and quantity demanded will still be the same i.e., inverse. 
    - However, it is just that a quantity demanded at each price point would be different.
    - The new demand curve is thus shifted from the original position.
    - If the income of people increases then they would demand a higher quantity of any good which they were consuming earlier.
    - In the new conditions of increased income, the relationship does not change. It is just that the curve shifts outwards.
    - On the other hand if suddenly people stop preferring a particular good then its demand curve would shift inwards.

**Law of Supply**

- Supply refers to the number of goods that producers are willing to produce at a given price that is offered to them in the market.
    - Supply i.e., willingness to produce depends on the price of goods in the market, price of related goods such as raw material and intermediate goods, availability of factors of production, such as labour and capital, technology, expectation, regulations by government, etc.
    - The law of supply states that keeping all other things constant, the willingness of a producer to produce a good increase with price, i.e., when the price increases then the quantity produced would be more and vice-versa.

**Supply Schedule**

- Graphical representation of the relationship between price and quantity supplied.

**The shift of the supply curve**

- When any other factor which was assumed to be constant changes i.e., the conditions for production change. Then the producer's willingness at a given price will change.
    - The relationship between price and quantity supplies would still be the same, it is only that at each price a different quantity would be produced.
    - For example, if the price of raw materials decreases then given each price the quantity produced at each price would be more than what was produced earlier.
    - The supply curve shifts outwards or rightwards.
    - On the other hand, if raw materials become expensive or scarce or government imposes new regulations then the supply curve will shift inwards.

**Law of markets - the equilibrium point**

- In the market, the buyers and sellers interact and arrive at a mutually agreeable price.
    - The price that prevails in the market at equilibrium would be that price at which neither any buyer nor any seller would be dissatisfied.
    - Such a price is called a market-clearing price. 
    - At this price, the quantity demanded (QD) is equal to the quantity supplied(QS) therefore anybody who is demanding is being satisfied and anybody who is producing is able to sell.
    - Therefore, neither is there any shortage or surplus. This price is the market price. 
    - At a given point, the market price may be different from this equilibrium price. However, eventually, the price will adjust in such a manner that it becomes equal to the equilibrium price.

### Types of Goods

![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 11.png>)

**Types of goods on the basis of their behaviour with the law of demand**

**Normal v/s Inferior goods**

- Normal goods are those whose demand increases with an increase in income.
    - Inferior goods are those whose demand decreases with an increase in income.
    - For example, when income increases a person may prefer to travel by road rather than public transport thus with an increase in income demand for fuel increases and therefore fuel is a normal good, in this case.
    - On the other hand, public transport is an inferior good as its demand has decreased.

**Goods based on the slope of the demand curve**

**Necessary good v/s Luxury goods**

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 12.png>)
    - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 13.png>)

- Necessary goods are those goods that have an almost vertical demand curve. Such goods depict the relationship that even a high degree of change in price does not cause a significant change in quantity demanded.
    - These goods consist of those on which consists of dependency such essential goods, life-saving goods, goods with no substitute, etc.
    - On the other hand, luxury goods are those where the relationship between Price and Quantity Demanded is almost flat, i.e., the slope of the demand curve is very less.
    - Such goods are those where even a small change in price, causes a large change in quantity demanded.
    - These goods are called luxury as a small drop in their price would invite many people to buy them and thus their luxury status may no longer remain.

**Goods based on exceptions to the law of demand**

**Giffen v/s Veblen goods**

- Goods are the exception to the law of demand.
    - Certain goods in some very specific situations are seen to not follow the law of demand. 
    - Such goods behave in a manner that their demand seems to either increase with an increase in price or decrease with a decrease in price.
    - These are circumstance-specific - more theoretical than real.
    - Giffen goods are inferior goods. 
    - Some inferior goods may show an increase in their demand despite a rise in price.
    - If the consumption of the normal good increases to such an extent that its price rises - so high that in terms of affordability this normal good becomes even more unaffordable in the present situation as compared to its affordability in the initial situation.
    - As a result, the household will reduce its consumption of this normal good because of an increase in its price.
    - Simultaneously, it will increase its consumption of inferior goods, despite its increase in price.
    - This would be done to make up for a reduction in consumption of that normal good.
    - Independently observing, this inferior good it seems that its quantity demanded has increased despite an increase in price.
    - Such goods are Giffen goods.

**Veblen Goods**

- Veblen goods are ultra-luxury goods.
    - These are those goods that are frequently associated status symbol of the owner.
    - Their price is such that it is for some people unaffordable and for others possession of these goods displays exclusivity.
    - If the price of such goods falls a little, they may still remain unaffordable for most and at the same time become not exclusive enough.
    - On the other hand, if their price increases, those who could afford them earlier but were not demanding, may start to demand them due to a greater exclusiveness associated with them.
    - These are Veblen goods.
    - For example, ultra-luxury sports cars.

**Public goods and Private goods**

- Public goods are those goods that are produced and paid for essentially by the government because the market fails to produce those goods.
    - There is a market failure because no producer is willing to supply these goods.
    - This is because despite there being demand nobody is willing to pay for such goods and services.
    - Nobody is willing to pay because of the free-rider problem.
    - This means that people do not want to pay for goods or services if they cannot enjoy them exclusively i.e. if they can not prevent others from enjoying the utility of goods and services which they have paid for, their willingness to pay for such goods reduces to zero.
    - Therefore, despite there being demand, there is no willingness to pay and therefore no willingness to supply.
    - In such a situation, market failure is said to occur and the government has to step in to provide these goods and services.
    - Example- clean air, public parks, public security, etc.
    - The reason for the collection of taxes by the government is essentially, to provide public goods and services. 

**Private goods**

- Goods that are provided by the market irrespective of the producer being government or private are called private goods.
    - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 1.jpeg>)

**Types of goods based on their position in the production process**

**Intermediate and Final goods**

- Intermediate goods are those goods that are yet to undergo economic modification.
    - Final goods are those goods on which no further economic modification is done.
    - Intermediate goods are still in the production process whereas final goods have completed their journey in the production process.
    - For example, tires sold by a manufacturer to a car company would be used by the car manufacturer as part of the final good which it sells i.e., car.
    - On the other hand, tires sold by the manufacturer to a consumer for replacing the old tires become an example of a final good.
    - When sold to a consumer, these tires exit the economic modification finally.
    - Similarly, salt purchased by a restaurant owner is an intermediate good as it will be sold as part of the final dish.
    - Salt purchased for domestic consumption is a final good because now it has exited the production process and there would be no further economic modification, even though there might be a physical or chemical modification.

**Good on the basis of their role in the production process**

- Here, we consider special types of goods called capital goods.
    - Capital goods are final goods.
        - Capital goods are those goods that are used to assist in the production process.
        - They are **not** intermediate goods - intermediate goods are themselves consumed in the production process - they may even lose their identity.
        - They are used in the production process but they themselves are not consumed.
        - They may wear out like any other good over a period of time still they are not themselves consumed.
        - Essentially, these are the machines and tools used in the production process.
    - The other type of final goods the non-capital goods are called consumer goods.
        - Consumer goods can be of durable or non-durable nature i.e., they may be long lasting or have a short life span.
        - Those consumer goods which need to be frequently replaced are consumer non-durables and those which need not be replaced frequently are called consumer durables.
    - Capital goods can be thought of as those final goods that a producer buys from other producers.

**Based on the impact on society**

**Merit goods and de-merit goods**

- Merit goods are those which have a positive effect on society. Ex- education and health services.
    - De-merit goods are those which have a negative effect on society. Ex- cigarettes.

**Complementary and Supplementary goods**

- Complementary goods are those goods that complement each other i.e., these goods are consumed together.
    - Therefore, if the demand for one good rises then the demands of complementary goods will also rise.
        - Example - tea and biscuit.
    - Supplementary goods are those goods that supplement each other.
    - The goods are not usually taken together.
        - Example - tea and coffee.
    - Supplementary goods are such that a consumer prefers both of them.
    - He or she would consume either one of them at a given time.

**DEPRECIATION**

- Capital goods even though are not consumed in production, still, wear out over a period of time.
    - This wearing out of capital goods is called depreciation.
    - Capital goods slowly lose their ability to assist in the production process.
    - This requires regular maintenance.
    - Despite maintenance, eventually wear out and therefore will require replacement at the end of their life span.

# NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTING

- In NIA, we study what constitutes the national income of a country and how to measure it.
    - The word national can be interpreted in two ways, "meaning within the nation" - within the geographical boundaries of a country, income earned by all the economic entities residing within the country is measured and is called GDP.
    - Meaning of the nationals i.e., citizens of a country.
        - The citizens can be present anywhere in the world.
        - Their total incomes are measured in this interpretation, the metric is called GNP (Gross national product).
    - **GDP** is equal to the total value of output **produced in a country** in a given time.
    - **GNP** Total value of output produced by a country's **citizens anywhere** in the world in a given time period.

**Models of Economy**

**A simple model of economy**

- In a simple model of an economy, we look at how does economic exchanges take place between the two basic economic entities.
    - The firm and the household.
    - The firm is a producer needing factors of production to produce goods and services demanded by household
    - The households provide these factors of productions required by the firm in return for factor payments i.e., incomes.
    - The expenditure of the firm is the income of the household (which is providing FOP).
    - The firm produces goods and sells them to the household.
    - The household shave the money to buy these goods because they had an income.
    - The firm gets revenue by selling goods to the households, it makes a profit by selling these goods. 
    - Profit like any other payment is provided to the factor of production i.e., entrepreneurship.
    - In this way, the firm earns revenue which it can use to pay for its factors of production.
    - Since it is the household that has provided the factors of production, they receive the following payments;
        - For land - rent, Capital - interest, Labour - wages, and Entrepreneurship - profit.
        - This completes the circular flow of income in this simple economy.
    - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 2.jpeg>)

**Circular flow concept/Dynamic equilibrium in an economy**

- In a simple economy, the magnitude of values on all the arrows depicting the value of goods and services sold, expenditures, and incomes received.
    - A=B=C=D, where, A is factor payments made by the firm or factor incomes received by the households. 
    - B equals the value of factors of production provided by the households.
    - C equals the value of goods and services produced and sold by the firm.
    - D equals the value of expenditure done by the households or received by the firms.
    - The equilibrium is based on various assumptions such as households do not save i.e., spend entire income on buying goods produced by the firms.
    - Also, it assumes there is no government (taxes or government spending), similarly no foreign interactions in the form of exports and imports, also that the firm is able to sell all that it produces, and also that the firm sells only to the households.
    - In a more real-world economy, such assumptions are often not true.
    - However, even after accounting for them, our essential conclusion does not change.
    - Essentially, from a simple model, we concluded that the value of incomes received was equal to expenditures done which were equal to the value of goods and services produced.
    - In an economy, these three things may not be equal at a given point in time.
    - However, over a period of time, if any one of these changes, then it induces a change in others as well.
    - The economy would not be in a static equilibrium but in a dynamic equilibrium. 
    - Whether the economy is in a growing/upward equilibrium or in a contracting/downward equilibrium will depend upon the quantum of injections and leakages.

**Injections and Leakages**

- That part of the household income in our simplistic model, which is not used to buy goods and services produced by the domestic firms is called leakage.
    - Leakages are usually in three forms- Savings, taxes, and imports.
    - Savings (S), that part of household income that is saved i.e., neither spend nor taxed. (Paradox of saving).
    - Households generally save more when they expect the economy to not do well in the future.
    - As a result, since they spend less, therefore, firms are able to sell less, therefore, the firms will produce less and because of that, the firms will utilize fewer factors of production by the households and then pay less to the households.
    - The households will eventually receive fewer incomes, fulfilling their prophecy or expectation of a worsening economic condition.
    - Therefore, increased savings actually may cause worse economic conditions.

**Taxes (T)**

- Taxes, paid to the government are so that part of income that is not used to buy goods and services produced.

**Imports (M)**

- Some part of household income may be spent to buy goods and services from foreign firms, leaking the domestic incomes outwards.

**Injections (I)**

- Injections are those expenses in the economy which do not come from the households.
    - Entities other than households may also demand goods and services produced by domestic firms.
    - These are;
        - Foreigners - export expenditure (X)
        - Foreign entities may demand goods and services produced by domestic firms.
        - This increases the demand for goods produced and thus sets in motion the process of more demand or factor of production, leading to higher factor incomes and so on.

**Government - Government Expenditure (G)**

- The government spends money on the economy.
    - It may either directly demand goods produced by the firms or it may increase the demand indirectly by paying salaries to government employees which in turn demand goods produced by the firm.
    - The government can be thought of as a specialized firm that produces public goods and services and sells them to other entities in return for taxes.
    - Similarly, like a firm, it uses factors of production supplied by households and makes factor payments in return.

**Firms - Investment expenditure (I)**

- Other firms may also demand goods produced by other firms.
    - In fact, firms sell capital goods to other firms which are final goods.
    - The expenditure that a firm does in buying final goods from other firms is called investment expenditure.
    - Injections and leakages are independently determined i.e., they are individually autonomous decisions.
    - Certainly, in an economy, they would influence each other.
    - However, they still are autonomous decisions depending upon multiple factors, including each other.
    - If the injections are more, the economy will be in a growing equilibrium i.e., incomes earned would be higher than before, expenses done would be higher and so would be the value of goods and services produced.
    - The opposite will be true when the economy is in a downward equilibrium.

**Conclusion**

- National income refers to the total incomes earned in an economy by the various factors of production, i.e., rent for land, wages for labor, interest for capital, and profits for entrepreneurship. 
    - Through our model of the economy as described above, the value of national income is by definition denoted by the top arrow i.e., A.
    - Also through our dynamic equilibrium model A=B=C=D.
    - Therefore in order to measure the magnitude of A, we can alternately measure the magnitude of C, i.e., the value of goods and services produced, or the magnitude of D i.e., the value of expenditure done.
    - These are in fact the 3 approaches to measure the value of national income.

**Calculation of national income**

- National income can be calculated using three different approaches - Income approach,  expenditure approach, and production approach.

**Income Approach**

- In this method, we find out the national income by adding up all the incomes received by domestic factors of production.
    - National income = rent + wages + Interest + profits. (**WIPR)**

**Expenditure Approach**

- In this method, we sum up the total expenses received by the domestic firms.
    - By definition, this is equal to the total incomes that firms will pay for the factors of production.
    - Expenses in the economy are done by households, government, firms as well as foreigners.
    - At the same time, the domestic entities, i.e., households, governments, and firms incur some part of their expenditure on goods produces by foreign firms as well.
    - This expense is called imports and is not received by domestic firms.
    - The sum total of expenditures received is also called the aggregate demand (AD) in the economy.
    - AD = C+G+I+(X-M). (**चिग्ज़म**)
        - Where C = total household expenditure (also called consumption expenditure).
        - G = total government expenditure.
        - I = Total investment expenditure.
        - X - total exports.
        - M = total imports.

**Production/product method** 

- In this method, we calculate the value of goods and services produced in the economy.

**GDP (Gross domestic product)** 

- It is defined as the value of final goods and services produced in an economy in a given time period, usually a year.
        - Value meaning that the economic value of goods is measured.
            - Economic value means the actual price at which a good or service is available.
            - It also means only those goods and services will be used/ included which possess an economic value.
            - Good which are either invaluable i.e., cannot be valued such as motherhood, or goods which have not yet been valued such as natural resources lying in the ground will not be included for the purpose of calculating GDP.
        - Only Final goods and services will be included.
        - Intermediate goods' value will not be included separately as it is already part of the value of the final good.
        - The entire production is counted and not just the sales.(net change in inventory)
        - Value of final goods and services in an economy - it signifies that we consider only the goods and services produced within the geographical boundary of a country.
        - Goods produced in the domestic economic territory will be included irrespective of who is producing them i.e. either a foreigner or a resident.
        - Both can produce goods and both will be counted as long as production is done in a domestic economic territory.
        - A country's embassy located on foreign soil is also considered domestic economic territory.
        - Time period - the output is measured in a given time period.
            - It is a flow variable and not a stock variable.
            - A flow variable is one that is measured between two points in time.
            - A stock variable is one that is measured at a given point in time.
            - A country's GDP is a measure between two points, usually the starting date of a financial year (1 April) and the end date of the financial year (31st March).

### Calculation of GDP

- GDP = total value of final goods.
    - The value of one final good can be seen as comprising of the value of intermediate goods used in the production plus the value-added by the producer during the production process.
    - The value of intermediate good can itself be seen as comprising of the value of intermediate goods used in its production process + the value added by the producer of this intermediate good.
    - This process of breaking down the value of a good into two components of the value of intermediate goods and value-added at a particular stage can continue till the point where the value of intermediate goods become zero and the entire value of a good produced is equals to the value-added in producing that good.
    - In fact, this last stage good is nothing but the raw material produced from nature.
    - Overall it can now be seen that the value of the final good is nothing but the sum of value-added during all stages of the production process.
    - Value of a final good GVAi = ∑VAi
        - Where ∑VAi represents the summation of value-added during all stages of production of the good i.
        - This is represented as GVAi, Gross value-added with respect to the good i.
        - Therefore, the value of a final good = GVAi =  ∑VAi.
        - Therefore, the value of all final goods = ∑GVAi.
        - Therefore GDP = value of all final goods and services produced = ∑GVAi.

- GDP - measured from demand perspective
    - GVA - measured from supply perspective

**Concept of depreciation and Investment**

- A firm invests to expand its production capacity.
    - Investment is done usually by buying capital goods (this is the major part of investment).
    - In economics, investment has three components;
        - 1) Fixed investment i.e., investment in machinery, land, etc. 
        - 2) Changes in inventory, a firm produces goods but may not be able to sell those goods in that particular year as a result it accumulates inventory.
            - This accumulation can be intentional or unintentional.
            - This change in inventory is also considered as part of total investment in the economy.
        - 3) Residential investment - investment in house buildings by households is residential investment.
            - Usually, investment is seen as a firm's expenditure.
            - However, households can also do investment in the economy in form of residential house buying.
                - Investments in the stock market are not considered as investments from the point of view of economics.

They are merely financial investments.

- - A firm buys capital goods that are supposed to last through multiple periods of production.
        - However, the capital goods deteriorate and need maintenance from time to time. 
        - For this, the firm incurs an expenditure.
            - This expenditure can be visualized as being done by the firm to replace some worn-out parts of capital goods.
            - The parts which replace the older parts were produced in the present year whereas they will be utilized as a part of goods produced in some earlier year.
        - Net output = Gross output - depreciation.

**Measurement of GDP at various price points**

- GDP calculates the final value of the goods and services produced in the economy.
    - The value can be measured at different points in the production process or at different points in time.

**Measurement at different points in the production process**

- There are 3 price points that we consider here, these are market price, basic price, and factor cost.
    - **Market price :** It is the actual price at which the good is available in the market. It is the most objective and readily available price.
        - The market price includes the effect of any kind of taxes or subsidy levied with respect to the good.
    - **Factor cost -** it is the price of the good after taking into account, the cost of all factors of production.
        - It is that price at which the firm would have sold its goods had there been no government intervention.
        - Government interferes by imposing taxes and giving subsidies.
        - Taxes increase the market price whereas subsidies reduce them.
        - Factor cost = Market price - indirect taxes + subsidies
    - **Basic Price -** traditionally factor cost was defined and calculated as mentioned above.
        - However, a distinction was created between the taxes and subsidies on a particular product vs taxes and subsidies on the production process.
    - Any tax, whether on the product itself or on the production process in general will have the effect of increasing the market price of the good.
    - Similarly, any subsidy given either on the product itself or on the production process, in general, will have the effect of decreasing the market price of the good.
    - Product taxes and subsidies are levied on the product itself i.e. after a particular product has been produced and has left the production process (in economic terms, this is called exiting the factory gate)
    - Market price includes the effect of all kinds of taxes and subsidies.
    - The basic price of a good is arrived at by removing the effect of only the product, taxes, and subsidies.
    - Basic price (BP) = market price - product taxes + product subsidy
    - To arrive at the factor cost that is the actual cost incurred due to factors of production had there been no government interference, we further remove the effect of production taxes and production subsidies from the basic price.

- Therefore, Factor cost (FC) = Basic price - production taxes + production subsidies

**GDP at these different points:**

- GDP at market price = GDP at basic price + product taxes - product subsidies
    - GDP at basic price = GDP at factor cost + production taxes - production subsidies

**Different price points in time**

- There are two different price points which are priced at the current year and prices in some past year(base year).
    - GDP at current prices = the current year’s prices are used to calculate GDP and such GDP is called GDP at the current price.
    - We usually use current market prices. GDP at the current market price is the “headline” GDP i.e. it is the GDP number that is the most commonly reported.
    - GDP at the current price (nominal GDP)
    - The current year’s GDP can also be calculated at some past year’s price.
    - This is done to compare the actual change in output by removing the effect of change in prices. Such GDP is called GDP at a constant price.(real GDP)
    - Here, we take in a base year.

- **Base year** 
        - It is a special year in the past which acts as a reference point to compare the GDP of future years.
        - _The choice of the base year is an important decision that depends upon:_
            - The base year must be a stable year i.e. the prices should not have fluctuated by much and the output should have been largely stable.
            - Stability does not mean stagnancy. It simply means a lack of volatility.
            - The base year should be as recent as possible so that it reflects the current pattern of production of the economy that is it means that the economy should not be structurally very different in the present year from the base year.

**Calculation of the national income**

- Income method= P+W+R+Interest
    - Expenditure= C+G+I+ (X-M)

**Inference from different methods of measuring national income**

- National income as measured from the 3 different approaches is the following:
    - **Product method:**
        - Output = total of the GVA
    - **Expenditure:** total expenses received by the firm which is equal to the aggregate demand (AD)
        - AD= C+G+I+(X-M)
    - **Income approach**
        - Total incomes earned= Profit + Wage + Rent + Interest
        - Incomes earned in the economy can be utilized in 3 different ways - spent, saved or taxed
        - Therefore, from utility side:
            - Income = consumption + savings + taxes
            - Also, incomes earned = expenditure received = C+G+I+(X-M)
            - incomes utilized can also be equated to total expenses received by the firms.
            - Therefore, C+S+T= C+G+I(X-M)
            - Assuming a closed economy, that is (X-M)=0 and cancelling C from both sides,
                - G+I=S+T
                - G-T=S-I
                - G-T is budget deficit
                - S-I= Savings investment gap
            - Further assuming a balanced budget that is G=T, we arrive at S=I

- **Inference: The above equation depict importance of savings in the economy**
        - Savings are the driving force for investments.
        - Even though savings and investments are independent decisions of households and firms respectively, still it can be seen that savings are necessary for investments.
        - Savings are correlated with investments as they are considered necessary for investments to occur at the same time, high savings rate (%age of national income which is saved) enables the government to spend more than what it earns from taxes.
        - Savings and investments are independent decisions of 2 different entities.
        - Paradox of savings tells us that high amount of savings means less consumption expenditure leading to less demand on the firms and therefore, a lesser need to invest.
        - Therefore, high savings rate is undesirable as far as investment decision by firms is concerned.
        - On the other hand, high savings rate means more savings are available and therefore borrowing for investment purpose can be availed at a lower interest rate.
        - Therefore, savings rate is not the only factor that determines investment in the economy. It is an important factor but not the only one.

- **Incremental Capital Output Ratio(ICOR)**
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 14.png>)
        - Higher the ICOR, lower the productivity of capital or the marginal efficiency of the capital.
        - It means the amount of capital required to produce 1 more unit of output.
        - A higher ICOR reflects that an economy needs more amount of capital to produce 1 unit of output. Therefore, a higher ICOR is undesirable.

- **Some concepts related to National Income**
        - The word national has been interpreted either to mean within a nation or by the nationals.
        - GNP and GNI assess national incomes/production by calculating the production done or incomes earned by nationals of the country.
        - Nationals who maybe living within or abroad the country
        - GDP = value of output produced in a country
            - Therefore, GDP = output produced by Indians in India (A) + output produced by foreigners in India (B)
        - GNP = value of output produced by Indians
            - Therefore, GNP = output by Indians in India + (C) + output by Indians abroad (D)

- As can be seen, C=A
        - GDP= A+B
        - GNP= C+D = A+D
        - A= GNP-D
        - GDP= GNP-D+B
        - GNP= GDP + (D-B)
        - GNP = GDP+ (value of output by Indians abroad- value of output by foreigners in India)
        - GNP = GDP + NFIA

- Value of output by Indians abroad- value of output by foreigners in India is also called as Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA).
    - Incomes earned by Indians abroad - incomes earned by foreigners in India = NFIA

- National Income (NI)
        - Net National Product at Factor Cost
        - NNP = GNP - Depreciation
        - FC = Market price - indirect taxes + subsidy
        - NNP at FC = GNP at Market price - indirect taxes + subsidies - depreciation

- Personal Income
        - UP = undistributed profit (some profit is not distributed by the firm)
        - Net interest payments (earned or paid by the household to the firm)
    - National Disposable Income = NNP at market price + other current transfers.
    - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 15.png>)
    - NI = NNI = GNP - Depreciation (now it is calculated at market prices)
        - Earlier NSO was using factor cost for calculating NI but now they use market price since 2015
    - NIH - net interest payment made by households
    - TrH - transfer payment made to households by government and firms.

**Transfer Payments**

- They are simply a transfer of rights to spend money. Transfer payments are not incomes. Incomes are defined as payments made for providing factors of production.
    - In an economy, money can be transferred between any two entities without providing any factor of production. Such transfer is called a transfer payment.
    - Transfer payments done within the economy will not be counted separately while calculating incomes.
    - Similarly, transfer payments done inter economy i.e. from abroad will also not be counted in either GDP or GNP.
    - However, they will be spent in the economy and get counted as expenditures which will lead to setting in motion the process of injection increasing the value of output and incomes earned in the economy in the future.

**National Income: Transfer Payment**

- Transfer payments from Indian abroad are not counted separately as they are already a part of India's National product.
        - They are not included in GDP as well as they are not incomes produced in India.
        - They will eventually become a part of India's GDP as they would be spent and earned ultimately in India.
    - Transfers can also be done to Indian nationals from foreign entities e.g., the World bank's grants - they are not earned by Indians but are made available so that they can spend.
        - Therefore, these are part of disposable income at the hands of the nations.
        - National Disposable Income = NNP (MP) + Other Current transfers
    - Private Income = Total money accruing to the private sector for spending = Factor Incomes from NDP to private sector + National Debt interest + NFIA + Current transfers from govt. + Other net transfers from RoW

**Randomized controlled Trial (RCT)**

- A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is **a type of scientific experimentof impact evaluation** in which the population receiving the program or policy intervention is chosen at random from the eligible population, and a control group is also chosen at random from the same eligible population.
    - The 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to **Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer** for their work adapting the method of randomized control trials (RCTs) to the field of development.

**GDP Measurement in India**

- यह पढ़ लो - [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050515/how-gdp-india-calculated.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050515/how-gdp-india-calculated.asp)

- **Data Collection:**
        - output measured through surveys – NSSO collects information.
        - CSO under the guidance of NSC combines the data gathered from surveys.
        - entities submit their production data themselves at the MCA21 database.
        - From the gathered data, **it extrapolates production level** for those that cannot be and has not been measured.
        - Data is extrapolated and combined using assumptions. Assumptions are rationally justified and follow standards laid down by **IMF’s National System of Accounts.**
        - In the next survey, the sample may change, data sets may change. Hence, need to ensure comparability across years. Again, assumptions are made while backtracking the data for other years.

- **Estimation of GDP**
        - GDP is estimated using various assumptions applied on data collected from samples, combined, and then extrapolated to estimate the output for the entire economy.

- Estimation of GDP constitutes the following steps:
        - A sample is created from amongst the firms in the economy from whom output data is collected.
        - Earlier, output was collected primarily using the annual survey of the Industries(ASI).
        - ASI consisted of about 20000 industries most of which were the manufacturing units.
        - Since 2015, we have switched over to the MCA 21 database.
        - MCA21 is a registry of all the firms that are registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
        -  These firms are required to file regular information with respect to their revenues and expenses with MoCA.
        - The firms which don't file their reports become dormant.
        - Some firms may be set up only for the purposes of reducing tax liabilities of the other firms- such firms are usually referred to as shell companies
        - Shell companies don't actually produce any output but merely exist on paper with the sole purpose of increasing the expenses of firms that produce real outputs so that their corporate tax liability is reduced.

- From the sample's output information value of output is calculated.
        - From this value, the output of other firms which are not in the sample is estimated.
    - This estimation process involves multiple assumptions and therefore is subjective in nature.
    - The assumptions for extrapolation and combination have to be justifiable and reasonable as a slight change in such assumptions may lead to over or under-estimation of the output.
    - In subsequent years, the assumptions and samples may change. This is a regular process where with help of technology and more resources, information from larger samples can be readily collected and more realistically combined.

- Changes in GDP measurement are continuous.
    - At the same time, when the methodology changes, comparison of GDP becomes difficult because changes in methodology may be a result of changes assumptions which became necessary due to changing structure of the economy.
    - In such situations, GDP is estimated for previous years using the new methodology. This is called as backtracking of GDP data.

**Why GDP?**

- GDP is universally accepted
    - GDP is the most objective
    - GDP is most easily measurable and readily available

**Limitation of GDP Estimation =**

- Increase through taxes, reduction of subsidies, and inflation
    - The distribution of output/income is not explained in this estimation
    - There is no measure of inequality
    - Non-monetary exchanges e.g. Household chores, Happiness
    - Indifference to externalities e.g environmental degradation
    - It does not tell about the quality of goods in the economy
    - Existence of informal sector – disproportionately large in emerging economies
    - Informal Sector
    - Black market
    - The discrepancy in data and methodologies

**Alternatives to GDP – Growth v/s Development**

- Per Capita Income – GDP Per capita
    - Measurement at PPP (Purchasing Power Parity)
    - HDI, GDI(gender development index), IHD(inequality adjusted human development index)
    - GII(innovation)
    - Green GDP = environmentally adjusted GDP
    - GNH(happiness)
    - Poverty metrics, etc.
    - Sustainable Development, Inclusive Growth, Five-year plans, SDGs

**Alternates to GDP and why does GDP persists**

- GDP measures the value of output.
    - It is a statistic that simply tells- there is no connotation with respect to the quality of output or with respect to its distribution. Therefore, many alternates which incorporate qualitative aspects of income and its distribution has been proposed.
    - E.g. - HDI measures development as attainment on aspects of health and education apart from income.
    - **Gender Development Index (GDI)** measures human development by accounting for different attainment levels by accounting with respect to gender
    - **Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI)** measures human development by accounting for differences in attainment with respect to income levels.
        - All countries show a divergence in human development when accounting for gender or inequality.
    - **Green GDP** takes into account aspects of environmental destruction or addition while calculating GDP.
    - Similarly, there are several other measures/indices which try to capture qualitative aspects of production and growth.
    - Some of them like HDI are widely reported and tracked.
    - With still all its shortcomings, GDP is the most recognized and followed measure of an economy.
    - This is so all other measures have discretionary elements which reduce their acceptability or have alternate opinions regarding how to assess the quality of production and growth.
    - At the same time, GDPs numbers are readily available and their measurement is largely standardized leading to the easiness of comparison amongst different economies.
    - That’s why despite its shortcomings, GDP is the most widely used indicator of economic output and growth.
    - Gross Environmental Product (GEP) is a measure of economic activity that takes into account the environmental costs and benefits associated with the production of goods and services.
    - Social Progress Index (SPI): The SPI measures a country's progress in meeting the basic human needs of its citizens, such as access to healthcare, education, and basic rights, as well as environmental sustainability and quality of life.
    - Happy Planet Index (HPI)
    - Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) - actors such as income distribution, environmental impact, and social well-being.

**GDP at PPP**

- It helps in comparing the GDP of various countries.
    - Example:
        - Value of India’s GDP= Rs. 500 cr.
        - Value of US GDP= $ 5 billion
        - Now, to compare them, one has to be converted into another currency.
        - To convert, the market exchange rate or PPP is used.
        - GDP in PPP terms will be more if compared with the market exchange rate.

# INFLATION

- Inflation is a general increase in the prices and fall in purchasing power of money.
    - Price level refers to a general idea of price in their mind. It can be seen as the average prices in the economy, the weighed prices depending upon the consumption, the consumption expenditure of a household, etc.
    - An increase in the price of a specific good is not called inflation, rather it is more specifically referred to as a contribution to a general increase in prices.
    - Prices are the value assigned to goods during a transaction.
    - Prices depend upon factors such as cost of inputs, profit margin of the producer, circumstances of the transaction, demand and supply of the good and related goods, and also the valuation unit, usually the currency.
    - In our discussion on inflation, we will assume the valuation unit to remain constant in its own value and will see inflation mostly in terms of changes in demand and supply.
    - An increase in demand or a fall in supply will cause the price of a good to rise whereas a reduction in quantity demanded or an increase in the supply of the good is expected to reduce the price of the good.

**From the price of a good to prices in the economy**

- For a specific good, we use its demand and supply curve to see a movement in its prices. However, at an economy-wide level prices of individual goods may move differently than the general price level.
    - At the economic level, we use the concepts of aggregate demand and aggregate supply to comment upon the movement in the price level.
    - The relationship of the price level with aggregate demand and aggregate supply is the same as the relationship of price with demand and supply, but the inference is different.
    - A reduction in the quantity demanded of a good with an increase in its price can be explained through the **substitution effect.**
    - **Meaning of substitution effect** - that with an increase in price, the people will switch to the substitute of the good leading to a decrease in quantity demanded.
    - It can also be explained with the help of income effect that is when price increases the disposable income decreases as the good becomes unaffordable resulting in the reduction of quantity demanded.
    - Relatively, a person is poorer than before.
    - When we talk at an economy-wide level substitution effect fails to explain a reduction in total quantity demanded as a fall in the quantity of one good will be accompanied by an increase in the quantity of substitute good.
    - Therefore, a reduction in quantity demanded cannot be explained by the substitution effect when price increases.
    - Rather, it is the income effect that is able to explain a reduction in aggregate demand when price level increases - households become relatively poorer with an increase in price level and therefore reduce their consumption in general.
    - A similar expression is given wrt relationship between the price level and aggregate supply that is total production is expected to increase with an increase in price level because producers, in general, will profit more when prices rise.

**Potential GDP**

- Potential GDP: refers to the maximum level of output an economy could produce in a sustained manner without generating inflation. It's a theoretical concept that represents the economy's capacity to produce when all available resources (labor, capital, technology) are fully utilized efficiently.
    - Demand and supply intersect by which we get price and quantity.
    - Similarly, AD and AS intersects which shows total demand and total supply in the economy at a particular price.

- **1st phase (Keynesian Range)**
        - As per Keynes, there is unutilized capacity in the economy. Due to this firms will not invest. This will lead to unemployment.
        - This unutilized capacity is reflected in the AS curve which remains flat during such times.
        - E.g. - A firm can produce 100 units but right now it's producing 50. By employing more people, 100 units of output can be achieved.
        - Production will be increased but without increasing the price.

- **2nd phase (sloping range)**
        - Then, there is the rising part of the AS curve.
        - Output is increasing and there is an increase in price because there is more demand.
        - The firm can employ more people.

- **3rd phase (near-vertical slope)**
        - Output cannot be increased beyond a point.
        - This is called Potential GDP.
        - Prices can increase but actual output won’t increase.
        - **Potential GDP -**
            - An estimate of the value of the output that the economy _would have_ produced if labour and capital had been employed at their maximum sustainable rates. that is, rates that are consistent with steady growth and stable inflation
            - The difference between the level of real GDP and potential GDP is known as the output gap.
                - The output gap refers to the difference between an economy's actual output and its potential output. In simpler terms, it reflects how close an economy is to operating at its full potential without experiencing inflationary pressures.
                - Positive output gap - Real GDP is higher than potential—the economy is operating above its sustainable capacity and is likely to generate inflation.

E.g. - Too much government spending can surge up demand that can exceeds the capacity of economy to produce and hence inflationary.

**Factors influencing inflation**

- **Demand-pull factors** 
        - When demand increases, the price will increase.
        - Changing consumption pattern
        - Rising incomes
        - More consumption due to population

- **Cost-Push factors**
        - It is due to an increase in cost due to the supply side.
        - The rise in wages of labor
        - Cost of inputs
        - Alternate uses of inputs/products- uses of a commodity are increased but the supply is the same. Eg- microchips/ micro conductors (earlier used in phones, now used in cars as well)/ Guar Gum.
        - Infrastructure bottlenecks including supply vulnerabilities- actual production and available supply are different (eg- wheat get spoiled due to lack of warehouses)
        - Rise in taxes
        - Administered prices - eg: Minimum wages, MSP (market says the price should be lower, but the government keeps it deliberately high).
        - International factors - international events can impact. Eg- any instability in West Asia will cause crude oil prices to rise.
        - Black economy
        - Cartelization

**Reasons for inflation**

Prices of goods change for several reasons. We can broadly look at those reasons from the perspective of demand and supply.

**Demand-side reasons:**

- Reasons which change the demand.
    - Eg- change in preference, change in incomes, change in the size of the population, availability of substitute goods, etc.
    - If the price rises due to demand-side factors. It is called demand-pull inflation.

**Supply-side reasons:**

- Factors influencing the supply of good.
    - A good’s supply that is its production and availability can be influenced by the cost of raw materials, supply of raw materials, government policies like taxes, subsidies, and regulation.
    - At the same time, the quality of infrastructure that is transportation and storage facilities also influences supply.
    - When due to impediments in supply, the prices of a good increase such inflation is called cost-push inflation.

**Other factors:**

- Factors outside the market such as international factors also influence the price of goods - they may influence either supply or demand or both. E.g. - war in the Middle East will cause the price of commodities to go up causing supply-side inflation.
    - The demand for oil may increase in some country which may cause international prices of oil to rise causing demand-side inflation.

**Types of inflation**

- Demand-Pull Inflation

**Terms related to inflation**

- These terms are generalist in nature.
    - **Hyper-inflation/ runaway inflation -** extremely high rate of inflation. E.g.- Zimbabwe’s economy had 10000% inflation a few years back.
    - **Deflation** - It is a fall in prices. It is the opposite of inflation.  Negative inflation
    - **Disinflation -** it is a fall in the rate of increase of prices that is a fall in the rate of inflation. In a disinflationary situation prices still rise but at a slower pace than before.
    - **Skewflation -** Skewed means something is behaving abnormally due to some factor, most of the factors which determine the behavior are normal but some factors are forcing an abnormal behavior.
        - Skewflation is when inflation is there in an economy for only certain goods. Most of the goods in the economy are not showing an abnormal price change but only a few goods are.
        - This is causing inflation to be high in the economy only due to these certain goods.
    - **Creeping inflation-** slow, steady rising inflation.
    - **Reflation -** low price in the economy, act as a disincentive for the producer. When prices fall too much, then attempts may be made to reflate the economy.
        - Reflation acts as an incentive for the producers to produce more. Thereby, it is seen as an attempt to increase the output of the economy and generate more employment.
    - **Structural inflation -** It is inflation that is explained using certain characteristic features of the economy.
        - In India, the quality of infrastructure is poor, leading to wastage of total production.
        - As a result, the quantity available for consumption is less than the quantity produced causing higher prices.
    - **Shrinkflation** is a phenomenon where the size or quantity of a product is reduced while the price remains the same.
    - **Stagflation -** stagnation in GDP + inflation
        - It is a special situation of an economy where an economy witnesses high rates of inflation along with falling output and rising unemployment.
    - In normal circumstances, an economy goes through cycles of ups and downs i.e. stages of **growth, slowdown, recession, and recovery.**
    - In situations of recession, an economy produces less and therefore, there is high unemployment.
    - In such a situation of high unemployment, wages are low, many are unemployed, and therefore demand for goods is low.
    - Normally, there is a deflation in the economy ie prices are very low.
    - Such a relationship between unemployment and inflation is represented through the Philips Curve.
    - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 18.png>)
    - Philips curve was plotted based on historical data.
    - It was seen that during times of high inflation, unemployment was low and vice versa the times of low inflation.
    - However, **Phillips Curve** is not predictive that is simply historical.
    - There are times when an economy may simultaneously witness high prices along with high unemployment.
    - Such a situation is called a **stagflationary situation.**
    - During stagflation, an economy’s output stagnates or contracts and there is high inflation simultaneously.
    - A contraction in output causes increasing unemployment and when accompanied by inflation we call this a stagflation situation.
    - **Recession-**  is significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity.
        - when there is a decrease in GDP for 2 quarters continuously.
        - When a recession stretches for a long time, we call it depression.
        - An inverted yield curve is used for prediction of recession.

- **Yield Curve**
        - Is the cure plotting the yield(interest rates) of bonds of same credit quality but differing maturity period.
        - It is curve of expectation.
        - 3 types
            - Normal yield curve - long term yield is higher then short term
                - Investors expect the interest rates are low are going to rise in long term
            - Inverted yield curve - long term yield is lower then short term
                - Investors expects the interest rates(yields) to decrease in future

**Measurement of inflation**

- Measuring the change in the price level.
    - Measuring inflation means measuring the rate of change of price level. The price level is the general conception of price in somebody’s mind.
    - The mathematical expression of price level will differ from person to person.
    - There are some standard ways through which price levels are determined. Eg- consumer prices, wholesale prices, producer prices, etc.
    - The method of measuring the change in price level is broadly the following:
        - The target group for which the price level change is to be measured is identified.
        - A basket of goods and services relevant to that target group is constructed.
        - The price information is collected which is most relevant for that target group
        - The price of the basket of goods for each month in the base year is calculated.
        - Since we measure inflation year over year, we index the prices in the base year to 100.
    - Year over year comparison means inflation is measured in a month of the present year by comparing the value of the index of this month in the present year with the same month of the previous year (and not base year)
        - Eg- if 2018 is the base year, the value of the basket would be 100 units each month.
        - If in January 2019, the value of the basket is 110, inflation would be 10/100= 10%.
        - If in Jan 2020, the value of the basket is 115, then inflation in Jan 2020 would be 5/110= about 4.9%
    - Inflation is measured by comparing the indices of this year with the previous year for the same month.
        - We do not measure month-over-month inflation that is Feb over Jan or march over Feb.

- **Producer Price Index** : It is not yet calculated in India but is proposed.
    - The present measurement of WPI was revised in 2017 to become closer to the PPI.
        - As a result, while ascertaining prices for the WPI calculation, the effect of taxes was removed-
        - Taxes imposed at the wholesale level are no longer included in the price used for WPI calculation.
        - However, taxes implicit in the prices, already are a part of the prices used for calculating WPI.

**Effects of inflation**

- Inflation is a regressive tax that is it disproportionately affected poor's.
    - **Producer vs. consumer**
        - Impacts consumers negatively because the prices of goods will be more. He/she won’t be able to buy more goods.
        - It incentivizes producers to produce more as they will get a higher price for the goods.

- **Effect of inflation on Borrowers and depositors**
        - Inflation causes erosion of buying power of money over time.
            - Therefore, the money available today in money terms would be much less tomorrow.
            - In order to have the same buying power, one needs a greater amount of money in future.
        - When a lender lends, the borrower returns the principal and interest in future.
            - The principle and interest on it are what was in its value in the past whereas it is being returned in future.
            - This means that a past value is returned in future.
            - This past value has deteriorated due to inflation.
        - Hence in real terms, the value which has been returned is a lesser value due to inflation.
        - A real interest rate is the interest rate that is effectively born by the borrower or earned by the lender.
        - Real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation.
            - Therefore when there is a high rate of inflation the real interest earned by the lender/creditor(लेनदार - बैंक) decreases as inflation eat away. visa versa a high rate of inflation benefits the borrower/debtor(देनदार).
        - In order to shield themselves, the lenders will either charge a high nominal interest rate or charge a fixed real interest rate.

- **Investments and Savings**
        - Savings can be seen as lending that depositors do to the banks.
        - When there are high inflation savings and therefore the savers lose out.
        - Investment is linked to inflation via interest rates.
        - Investment decisions are taken prominently due to 2 factors
            - A) The expectation of return on investment.
            - B) The interest rate paid to the investor
        - Expectations are futuristic and may be either rational or irrational.
        - Interest rates are in the present i.e., known.
        - If there is high inflation it may cause the nominal interest rates to rise.
        - This causes lesser investment as lesser investors are now expecting to make a positive return on their investment and consequently more on saving instruments.
        - High inflation -> high nominal rate of interest -> less investment & more saving.

- **Government and taxpayers**
        - Price wage spiral is when prices increase, the workers go to the management to ask for an increase in wages.
        - Because of inflation, taxpayers pay more proportion of their incomes as taxes due to the price wage spiral.
        - Due to which wages increase as a result of an increase in prices.
        - Fiscal drag is a phenomenon in which people are dragged into higher taxation brackets consequent to the rise in their incomes.
        - As a result, the government collects more taxes without any change to the fiscal policy.
        - People's income increase but their disposable incomes do not increase in the same proportion.
        - Therefore, it is not enough to offset the impact of inflation.
        - Due to this, the consumers reduce their consumption and the economy cools down.
        - Therefore fiscal drag acts as an automatic stabiliser for an overheating economy by breaking the price wage spiral.

- **Effects of inflation on imports and exports**
        - Inflation affect imports and exports primarily through their influence on the exchange rate.
        - Higher inflation typically leads to higher interest rates, and this leads to a weaker currency.
        - Weak currency - export increase, import becomes expensive.
        - A currency with a higher inflation rate will depreciate against a currency with lower inflation.

**Controlling Inflation (Will be covered under the monetary policy in a detailed manner)**

- Demand-side factor -  Monetary policy.
    - Supply-side factor- Aggregate supply is the total volume of goods and services produced by an economy at a given price level.
    - When there is a decrease in the aggregate supply of goods and services stemming from an increase in the cost of production, we have cost-push inflation.
    - Cost-push inflation means prices have been "pushed up" by increases in costs of any of the four factors of production (labour, capital, land or entrepreneurship) when companies are already running at full production capacity.
        - With higher production costs and productivity maximized, companies cannot maintain profit margins by producing the same amounts of goods and services.
        - As a result, the increased costs are passed on to consumers, causing a rise in the general price level.
    - Supply Pull Inflation :There are also certain factors that operate on the opposite side and tend to reduce the aggregate supply.
        - Supply Shock : When there is a big increase in prices of critical commodities like oil. This results in higher transport costs and all firms would see a rise in costs.
        - Higher Wages: Wages form a large percentage of costs for firms. Strong labour unions can influence inflation as they push for higher wages, which will lead to an increase in costs of production for the firm and hence higher-priced goods.
        - Imported Inflation: A devaluation of the currency would result in higher prices of imported goods.
        - Higher Taxes : An increase in indirect taxation. Higher VAT and Excise duties will increase the prices of goods.
        - Natural Calamities: Natural calamities like floods, earthquakes etc. can lead to a shortage of supply of essential commodities and increase prices
        - Artificial Scarcities: These happen due to activities like hoarding and speculation.
        - Increase in Exports: This can again lead to a shortage of the commodity in the local market as more commodities are being exported out of the country.

- **Inflation premium**
        - Investors seek this premium to compensate for the erosion in the value of their capital due to inflation.
        - For example - if the interest rate is 2%, inflation is 5% then investor will demand the interest rate of 7% (5% being the inflation premium to compensates for the erosion of the savings)
            - Basically they want high nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation.

# MONETARY POLICY

- The monetary policy discusses the availability and control of money in the economy.
    - Monetary policy is the control of the quantity of money available in an economy and the channels by which new money is supplied.
    - By managing the money supply, a central bank aims to influence macroeconomic factors including inflation, the rate of consumption, economic growth, and overall liquidity.

**Money, Monetary policy and Banking**

- Money is commonly defined as a medium of exchange
    - This means it is something that can be used to facilitates exchanges of goods of value between two people.
    - As such there are following properties that are desirable.
        - **It should have some intrinsic value**.
            - As intrinsic value ensures that it is acceptable.
            - Even if something does not have intrinsic value, even then if some authority can provide some guarantee regarding stability of its value, then it can be used as a medium of exchange.
                - Fiat Currency - Means something which acts as medium of exchange by order of some authority.

Currency notes have some value written on them as their value by order of the authority that is central bank.

In fact, the most important task of central bank is to enforce stability and acceptability of value of currency.

- - Crypto currencies neither have any intrinsic value nor a guarantee by the central bank.
                - Despite this they may be used for transactions because of other desirable properties.

- **It must be capable to be stored.**
    - **It should not lose value over time or loose only a minimum value.**
    - **Should not be easily replicable.**
        - Can’t be counterfeit to prevent frauds.
    - **Further it should have essential properties**.
        - That it must be available on demand and it must be divisible into smaller units to enable multiple values of the transactions**.**
    - **Above all, It should be acceptable by the most.**
        - To function as medium of exchange.

**Miscellaneous points related to medium of exchange and concepts**

- Gold, iron, copper, diamond etc as all these had some intrinsic values, do not lose value over time, can be stored.
    - **Gold** has desirable properties of medium exchange but availability of the gold not in adequate quantity and storage cost of gold is high
    - **Cryptocurrency** has no intrinsic value but still currency because of its acceptability by the people. However Crypto currency has all the other desirable properties of Currency such as its storable, can’t be replicated and faked, it does not lose value over period of time such as (1000 coins today will remain same for longer period of time).

- **Legal tender-** is a legally allowed as a means of extinguishing the debt. Such as currency notes, demand draft etc.

**Bitcoins as currency**

- Its encrypted currency and it’s not issued by central authority and neither its value guaranteed by RBI.
    - Stability of its value is not guaranteed.
    - Still, it’s in demand because it has other **desirable features such as**
    - Encryption and Decryption makes it secure and non-replicable and cannot be faked.
    - Transactions are tightly secured.
    - It does not lose value over period of time such as (1000 coins today will remain same for longer period of time).
    - Its capable to be stored.

**Functions of currency notes**

- **Transactive function**
        - of times money changes the hands is known as velocity of money.
        - value of the transaction of currency equal to amount of money plus velocity of transactions in the economy.
        - Value of total transaction = value of nominal GDP + value of transactions of Intermediate goods.
        - Price level = (amount of money available in economy multiplied by velocity of money) divided by real GDP.
        - P = (m*v)/y.

- **Transaction Demand**:
        - Value of transaction in the economy = M.v --1
        - Also, the value of transaction = K (Nominal GDP)---2
        - So, from 1 and 2, we get:
            - M.v = K. PY
            - P = M.v/Y
        - Here, v/K is constant and so let it be v
        - This equation also called as **Fisher Equation** is interpreted by classical economists to explain the dependence of prices on the supply of money
        - They say that since the velocity of money is a behavioural parameter
            - Therefore, it is constant for a society
        - Further, the real GDP i.e. Y is also stable and predictable and therefore prices (P), are essentially dependent upon (M)
            - If M increases, prices will increase
        - Therefore, for classical economists, prices or inflation is always caused by an excessive supply of money 
        - Keynesian object, to this classical interpretation, as they dispute that both V and Y are dynamic and therefore change 
        - Hence, prices are not only dependent upon M, rather there are other factors as well 
        - They do not dispute the role of money in the determination of prices, they only dispute its importance 
        - From the above, equation, M = P.Y/v
            - or MDT = Value of Nominal GDP 

- **Speculative Demand for Money**:
        - It refers to the amount of money needed for speculative purposes ie the money needed to be based on some prediction for the future 
        - It can be illustrated in the following way:
            - Let the total amount of money be "M"
            - Out of this, say "T" is needed for transaction purposes
            - Therefore, M-T is left
            - T is the transaction demand for money 
            - Out of M-T:
                - To keep liquid (L) = Speculative demand for money
            - To keep in some other form = M-T-L
            - When money is kept in some other form it is for a certain purpose, most commonly to retain the value of money ie to prevent its deterioration due to inflation 
            - Secondly, to earn interest if possible 
            - The money stored in liquid form has the benefit of being liquid ie can be used immediately when required 
            - However, its opportunity cost is the interest rate   
            - L, in the above example, ie the money which is not being converted into some other form is the speculative demand for money ie it is that demand for money that is arising out of some speculation about future
            - For example, a person may think that I will need L amount of money in future, therefore he is ready to forego the interest that he can earn
            - It can then be seen, that when the interest rate would be higher, the lesser amount of money would be kept for speculative purposes as the opportunity cost will rise
                - speculative purpose को स्टॉक मार्केट इन्वेस्टमेट से समझो
            - Therefore, we say that the speculative demand for money varies inversely with an interest rate

**Assets**:

- Retain the value invested and expect to earn and interest i.e. appreciate
    - A bond is a debt instrument, for example, a Government bond is an asset
        - The borrower is the issuer and the lender is the bondholder
    - A bond can have the following details: Name of issuing entity; principal; interest; time period; purpose, etc
    - Yield (Effective earning) = Interest Earned - Premium Paid

- **Part I:**
        - There are different instruments available in the market which have different properties and benefits 
        - We can classify them broadly as liquid (i.e. earn no or low rate of interest) and assets (i.e. are expected to retain i.e. preserve and appreciate the value)
        - Liquid instruments are practically infinite i.e. there is no limit to them whereas assets are limited in quantity which gives them a value
        - Let, savings bank account be an example of a liquid avenue whereas the government bonds be an example of assets 
        - Since assets are limited, they yield a higher return on investment as compared to the liquid avenues which yield lesser 
        - Bonds earn a higher rate of interest but are limited in quantity and therefore everybody would like to buy them but only a few will be able to buy them 
        - Since only a few are able to buy, those who are left out will offer a premium to buy the assets which they do not possess i.e. bonds
            - As a result, the price of bonds in the market will go up
        - At equilibrium, the price would be such that the return from the bond by purchasing it at a premium would be equal to the interest earned from savings bank deposits.

- **Part II - Speculative element**:
        - As can be seen, the price of the bond is determined by the interest rate differential that it has saving bank interest (r)
        - If r increases then the bond becomes relatively less attractive and therefore its equilibrium price will fall
        - If r decreases then the bond will become relatively more attractive than before, thereby the premiums that people are willing to pay on the bond will increase and hence the bond becomes expensive 
        - At present, different people will have different expectations about the interest rates in future
        - Therefore, they will have different expectations about the value of their assets in future 
        - If somebody expects interest rates to increase, it means they will anticipate a fall in the value of their assets and therefore the rational decision would be to sell their assets today and convert them into liquid money 
        - The speculative portion of the money will increase whereas the asset portion will decrease  
        - However, when somebody expects the interest rates to fall they anticipate the value of their assets to increase 
        - Therefore, rather than selling their existing assets, they will hold on to them for the future and will also buy more assets from the speculative portion of money which they have 
            - Therefore, the speculative demand for money will decrease and the asset portion will increase
        - So, an increase in interest rates, like the savings bank interest makes the alternate avenue of investment relatively less attractive
        - Therefore leads to the conversion of assets into the speculative portion. Hence increasing the speculative demand
        - The interest rates referred to in the above statements are the interest rates earned on savings banks which are different from the interest that a bond pays
        - If the interest rate on the bond increases then people will prefer to convert their liquidity into assets i.e. speculative demand will decrease
        - Ultimately, the decision to keep money in liquid form ie the speculative demand versus the decision to keep it in asset form depends upon whether a person expects an appreciation or depreciation in their assets 
        - If a person expects appreciation, they will keep more proportion of their money in asset form rather than speculative form 
        - Therefore, speculative demand would be less 
        - Further, a person would expect appreciation or depreciation of their assets based on their expectation of interest rates in future 
        - If they expect interest rates to move in a manner that causes an appreciation of assets then speculative demand would reduce and vice versa
        - In general, the speculative demand for money is said to be inversely proportional to interest rates i.e.
            - When interest rates are high, speculative demand would be zero as everybody would convert their speculative portion of the money into assets
        - Whereas, when interest rates are low, the speculative demand is high because nobody expects an appreciation of their assets and therefore they will convert their assets into the speculative portion increasing the speculative demand for money.

**Speculative demand Revisited**:

- It is essentially the speculation interest rates in the economy and the existing interest rates are a fact 
    - The expected return on an asset is also a fact which is captured in the interest which the asset has promised - a fact
    - Based on the promised return, the market price of the asset will immediately adjust to a level that the effective return (yield) from the asset is equal to the risk-free interest rate in the economy or what is called the General interest rates 
    - Speculation is essentially on whether these general interest rates will rise or fall
    - If someone expects interest rates to rise, they would then anticipate asset prices to fall 
        - [Bond prices are inversely proportional to interest rates] 
    - For this person, the rational choice would be to sell his bond holdings today and convert them into money thereby increasing the speculative component 
        - The speculative demand for this person is then said to increase 
    - At the economy-wide level, if more people expect interest rates to fall in future {when r is closer to r (max} then more people would anticipate an increase in value of their assets 
        - Therefore, they would convert their speculative portion into assets, reducing the speculative demand for money

**Liquidity Trap:**

- Liquidity trap refers to a situation where conventional monetary policy tools become ineffective in stimulating economic activity. This happens when interest rates are already very low, and further reducing them has little to no impact on borrowing and spending.

- When r approaches r(min) more and more people anticipate a rise in interests from here and therefore a fall in asset prices 
    - Therefore, people convert their assets into the speculative component increasing the speculative demand 
    - In such a situation, if the money supply increases then it may not be used by people to buy any assets or for consumption, but rather they would prefer to hoard cash.
    - Therefore, an increase in the money supply may at best (satiate people's cravings for cash)
    - It will not be used to be invested in some asset 
    - Hence, Liquidity trap can lead to low or falling inflation, because lack of demand for goods and services can put downward pressure on prices, this can be caused by **deflationary spiral.**
    - Hence, the monetary policy may fail to increase investments in the economy
    - The money demand function is seen to approach infinity and is said to be infinitely elastic
        - (More on liquidity trap on Quantity Easing)
    - Total Demand of money = Transaction Demand + Speculative Demand = KPY + r(max) - r/r-r(min)
        - Keynesian theory suggest that total demand is transaction demand + speculative demand + precautionary demand

- Sometimes Md is represented as = ao+boY+Co/r, etc

**Money Supply**:

- The supply of money refers to the amount of money that the central bank has decided to be available in the economy 
    - Central Bank decides this number based on its assessment of how much money should be there 
    - This question, of how much money should be there is based on multiple factors that the central bank takes into account
    - For example, if more money is available, it will facilitate growth as more transactions can be carried out 
    - On the other hand, more money will also be inflationary (Fisher Equation)
    - Therefore, deciding how much money should be printed and circulated is a decision that has contrasting effects on two desirable goals i.e.
        - While it facilitates growth, it also causes inflation
        - Therefore, the central bank decides on this question on how much money is supply by looking at both the affordability of money (ie the rate at which it is available should not be prohibitively high that it compromises growth).
        - As well as the negative effect of excess money that causes inflation
        - This is called a growth-inflation trade-off in monetary policy ie the manner in which monetary policy is conducted has contrasting effects on growth and inflation.
        - In the money market i.e. the market for buying and selling of money (different from the conventional money market where short term instruments are traded) the demand function of money can be represented as Md = ao+boY-Cor
            - Given the level of GDP ie Yo (today), 
                - Md = ao+boYo-cor, which can be graphically represented in the following way: (As in-class lecture)
        - Given a level of money supply and a money demand function at a Yo level of GDP, money will be available at an interest rate ro
        - If the GDP increases from Yo to Y1, demand for money increases causing an increase in the cost of money ie interest rates 
        - If interest rates are judged to be too high in the economy, the central bank may decide to increase the money supply from Mso to Ms1, causing a decline in interest rates 
        - Money supply, since it is a determined number, depends upon multiple factors that central banks take into account 
        - Money supply not just influences the interest rate, it is also influenced by the interest rates through the money creation process 
        - The money creation process helps us visualise the total amount of money in the economy 
        - Money is not just created by the central bank but is also multiplied by the banking system 
        - The multiplication factor is dependent on the interest rates and thus the money supply itself is dependent on interest rates as well

**Measures of Money Supply**:

- Mo - Called high powered money. Or monetary base
        - It is the amount of money that the central bank puts into the economy.
        - The total amount of money circulating is different from Mo as Money is also created by the banking system 
        - It also includes the commercial [bank deposits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-deposits.asp) held in the central bank's reserves.
        - It also include the vault cash of commercial base.
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 20.png>)

- **The following are the measures of money:**
        - M1 = CC + DD = It is the most liquid but narrow measure of money supply
            - CC - Currency in circulation ie currency notes and coins 
            - DD - It is net demand deposits with the banking system (saving, current etc.)
                - Demand deposits are those which are available on-demand ie when demanded
                - The word net means that interbank deposits are excluded
                - Interbank deposits are deposits of one bank with another bank
        - M2 = M1 + Post Office Demand or Savings Deposits.
        - M3 = M1 + Time Deposits with Banks 
            - It is a broader interpretation of money supply as it includes the less liquid time deposits 
            - Time deposits are those which are available at a specific time and not easy on demands 
        - M4 = M3 + Savings, Time and other deposits with Post  Office
            - It is the broadest measure of money supply

- The amount present or circulating in the economy is our money supply. Basically, money in the economy is created by RBI.
    - At the same time, the banking system also creates money.
    - M0 = Initial money created by RBI.
    - From this money, the banking system creates more money, which is denoted as M1, M2, M2, M3, and M4
    - As per certain inclusions and exclusions, M1 is the narrowest consideration of money supply, as we go to M4, we get to the broadest scope of money.
    - M1 is most narrow as it consists of only the most liquid money.
    - M4 is broad because it consists of all types of money-more and is less liquid.

- M1 = Currency in circulation + Demand deposits (Current Accounts and Saving Accounts).
    - M2 = No longer relevant, but it consists of M1 + Post Office deposits. As post offices are now converted into Postal payment banks, even those deposits are now considered as Bank deposits.
    - M3 = M1 + Time deposits with banks(Fixed deposit).
    - M4 = M3 + all other deposits with post office, except some deposits like National Savings Certificates, etc.

**CREATION OF MONEY**

- Money creation takes place by two entities - RBI and the banking system.
    - RBI creates the initial high-powered money whereas the banking system multiplies that initial money into more money by virtue of its operations of lending and borrowing.

Money creation by RBI:

- RBI creates money by printing currency notes and buying assets from them.
    - Money is not merely created through printing, rather it comes into existence in the economy only when RBI introduces it by buying assets.
    - A currency note is essentially proof of liability by the RBI.
    - RBI has to buy assets because a currency note essentially is a promise by RBI to pay the bearer a sum promised on that note.
    - Since a currency note is a promise, its acceptability is based on the ability of RBI to perform or uphold that promise.
    - People will believe and therefore, the trust in the monetary system will remain only when RBI has the required capability to perform its promise.
    - This is why buying assets of value is a necessary part of RBI’s money creation process.
    - This money that RBI creates is called High Powered Money.

**RBI BALANCE SHEET**

|   |   |
|--|--|
|**Assets of RBI**|**Liabilities of RBI**|
|Gold reserves<br><br>Foreign exchange reserves<br><br>Foreign government bonds<br><br>Indian government bonds<br><br>Lending by RBI to Banks, Central and State Governments.|Cash in circulation.<br><br>Deposits with RBI - of Banks, Central and State Governments.<br><br>Loans that are taken by RBI|

- The biggest component on the liability side is the currency in circulation is a zero-cost liability for RBI (a currency note of 100 rupees issued 20 years back had a liability worth 100 rupees when it was issued, and has the liability worth 100 rupees even today).
    - Some other liabilities are deposits with RBI by governments and banks, loans are taken by RBI.
    - It is a very low-cost liability as government bonds interest rates are very low
    - So RBI has virtually zero cost liabilities.
        - RBI Assets - Gold, foreign reserves, foreign government bonds, Indian government bonds, loans extended by RBI to banks and governments.
        - Assets are interest gaining, as well as the assets are also appreciating.
        - RBI earns income by the virtue of its functions; which is to maintain monetary stability in the economy.
        - To perform its functions with effectiveness, RBI incurs liabilities at a low cost and buys assets that are interest-earning or appreciating.
    - Since RBI earns interest income and its assets appreciate, therefore the total incomes earned by RBI are quite high.
    - From these incomes, RBI incurs all of its expenses such as payments of salaries, costs incurred in printing notes.
    - The profit that RBI earns is called **seigniorage**.
        - From this profit, RBI retains some buffer for itself so that it can meet some emergency expenses that may arise during the year.
        - The remaining part is transferred by RBI to the government as RBI’s transfer of surplus income.
        - In 2017, Bimal Jalan Committee gave recommendations that were accepted to determine the amount of money that RBI should keep with itself.
        - The remaining amount was recommended to be transferred to the government.

**High Powered Money- M0**

- It refers to the money created by RBI.
    - Sometimes M0 is also referred to as the total liability of the central bank of the country.
    - It is from this money that the banking system creates more money.
    - The banking system creates money by its operations of taking deposits and lending money.

- Two important metrics are –.
        - Currency Deposit Ratio - CDR reflects the preference of people to keep money in the form of cash, rather than bank deposits.
            - If out of 100 rupees, 30 rupees are kept as cash and 70 rupees are kept as deposits, the CDR will be 3/7.
            - It is purely a behavioural parameter. During the festive season, CDR usually increases.

- Reserve Deposit Ratio (RDR) –
        - Money kept as reserves out of the total deposits.
        - This is a determined ratio.
        - If the reserve deposit ratio is high, banks would not be able to lend money.
        - That means if RDR is less, more amount of money can be lent, so more amount of money can be created in the economy.

**MONEY CREATION BY THE BANKING SYSTEM**

- The banking system creates money by virtue of its operations of taking deposits and lending them.
    - The banks receive money in form of deposits and depending upon the probability that how much money would be required by the depositors, banks keep a proportion of deposits as reserves.
    - The remaining amount is lent by the banks and therefore it is available to be spent.
    - The borrower of this money spends it to buy some goods and services and therefore some person receives this borrowed money as his own money.
    - A proportion of this money is kept as currency (cash) and the remaining proportion is deposited back in the banking system.
    - This preference for currency is measured through the Currency Deposit Ratio (CDR).
    - The money received back by the banking system is again used to lend after keeping aside the reserve amount.
    - Therefore this process of lending, spending, and receiving deposits keeps going on albeit with a decreasing magnitude in each round.
    - Money supply, which measures the amount of money in the economy thus, keeps on increasing with each round.
    - Let money supply be measured through M1 (CC + DD).
        - In each round, the currency in circulation, and the deposits with banks go up, thereby increasing the money supply.
        - Since the magnitude keeps on decreasing, there is only a limited amount of money that is created from some initial high-powered money.
    - We say that the initial high-powered money, M0 has been multiplied by some number greater than one to create the actual amount of money supply, M1.

- **M1= m* M0**, where M1= Money supply.
        - m = Money multiplier
        - M0 = High Powered money.

**Currency Deposit Ratio**:

- CDR represents the preference of people to keep money in form of currency vis-à-vis deposits.
    - CDR is a purely behavioural parameter.
    - CDR = CC/DD
    - It increases during the festive season as people then tend to keep more cash with them.

**Reserve Deposit Ratio:**

- RDR is the proportion of deposits that banks keep as reserves.
    - RDR is a variable that is set by the central bank of a country.
    - Its implementation is in form of CRR and SLR.

**Bank Run:**

- It is a situation in which the people rush towards the banks to withdraw their deposits because they do not trust the banking system, therefore they would like to withdraw their deposits.
    - However, since the banks have lent their deposits, the banks are unable to honour their commitments.
    - It causes a situation of collapse in the banking system is called a bank run.

**Bail in and Bail out**

- Bail in
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 21.png>)
    - A bailout is when a business, an individual, or a government provides money and/or resources (also known as a [capital injection](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-injection.asp)) to a failing company.
        - Bail out generally provided when the entity under distress is 'too big to fail' and can cause systemic failure in economy.
    - Bailouts help to keep creditors from losses while bail-ins mandate that creditors take losses.

**Spread**:

- It is the difference between the lending rate of the bank on the loans it extends, and the deposit rate which the bank provides on the deposits placed in it.
    - It is understood as the profit of the bank.
    - Spread = Lending rate - Deposit rate = Profit of the bank.

**Money multiplier (m)**

- It refers to the ratio by which high-powered money (M0) increases to lead to the actual amount of money circulating in the economy.
    - “m” is inversely proportional to the reserve deposit ratio.
    - If RDR increases, the amount of money with the banks to lend for the next round will decrease.
    - Therefore they will receive a lesser amount of money as deposits in the next round.
    - Therefore, the money creation process will come to a halt quickly, or fast.
        - M = 1+ CDR/(CDR + RDR)

**MONEY SUPPLY**

- The money supply is sought to be controlled by the central bank through both quantitative and qualitative measures
    - The quantitative measures deal with controlling the quantity of money through various tools which increase or decrease the money multiplier or the high-powered money.
    - The qualitative tools control the money supply by way of giving directions or persuasion to restrict or increase the money supply to a particular sector or for a particular purpose.

**QUANTITATIVE TOOLS**

- Tools that control the money multiplier directly - those affecting the reserve deposit ratio -

- **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)**
        - It is the proportion of the bank’s NDTL (Net Demand and Time Liabilities) which have to be maintained with RBI in form of cash.
        - **CRR is a regulatory requirement, and not a deposit of a bank with RBI and it earns no interest. Usually, it is around 4%.
        - It is also called required reserve ratio or simply reserve ratio
        - Net in NDTL means that inter-bank deposits are excluded while calculating the required demand and time liabilities.

- **Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)**
        - It is also a regulatory requirement stating that a proportion of a bank’s NDTL has to be maintained by the bank in form of designated liquid assets which are kept with the bank itself.
        - Examples of such assets are cash, gold, government bonds, designated high-quality corporate bonds, designated foreign government bonds, etc.
        - The idea is that such assets can be readily liquidated in case banks need them to be liquidated.
        - Both CRR and SLR affect the amount of money that could be lent by the banks freely in the economy.
        - If CRR or SLR increases, money left with the bank to lend will decrease and therefore, the money creation process will end early, thereby reducing the money multiplier and vice versa.
        - Both CRR and SLR are decided by RBI and not monetary policy committee.
            - Monetary policy committee decides only REPO rate.

- **Open market operations**
        - OMOs are those instances when RBI involves itself to carry out transactions directly in the market.
        - Then it is called outright open market operation.
        - When RBI buys assets, then it will pay for them either by printing currency or by issuing a cheque on itself.
        - As a result, both assets as well as liabilities of RBI increase, therefore the high-powered money which is the liability of RBI also increases, thus increasing the money supply.
        - When RBI issues a cheque on itself, the seller of the asset deposits this cheque to the bank, and the bank enchases this cheque from RBI.
        - The only difference is when RBI prints money, it may give it directly to the seller of the asset, or it may give to the bank via a cheque issued to the seller on itself.
        - Usually, RBI does not issue currency directly to people but rather issues it through banks.
    - If RBI has to reduce the money supply, it may sell the assets which it holds in the market and thereby extracts money from the economy.
        - When it sells assets and receives money, its assets go down along with its liabilities, reducing the high-powered money.

- **Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF):**
        - LAF is a facility extended by the banks to tide over temporary mismatches in liquidity.
        - At any given time, the bank may have excess deposits over the credit demand or the credit demand may be in excess of its deposits.
        - In such cases, RBI, being the banker of the banks provides a liquidity adjustment facility.
        - If banks need money, RBI lends it to them for a short term at an interest rate called the Repo rate.
        - RBI used to lend money to the banks for a long term at a Bank rate. However, long-term lending was discontinued and now the bank rate is dormant.
            - It is aligned with the penal MSF rate.
        - During Covid, RBI extended the LAF lending to banks for a longer period at the rate of long-term repo rate under Long Term Repo Operations (LTRO). Conversely, RBI also borrows from the banks in case banks have excess deposits over credit demand. Such borrowing takes place at the Reverse Repo rate, which is less than the repo rate.
        - * Repo and Reverse Repo operations take place through buying and selling of government bonds, and an agreement to repurchase them within a short period.
            - For example - if a bank wants money from RBI, it will sell government bonds, and agree to purchase them back from RBI within a period of 15 days. The Money which RBI will lend is lent at a repo rate.
        - LAF (Policy) corridor will be SDF (repo - .25%) and MSF (repo + .25%)
            - Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rate. - bank deposits with RBI and RBI don't issue any collateral (unlike Reverse Repo where RBI issue govt security to banks).

- **Marginal Standing Facility:**
        - Main aim of reducing volatility in the overnight lending rates in the inter-bank market
        - Banks are required to maintain SLR in form of designated liquid assets, such as government bonds.
        - Government bonds are necessary for banks to access the liquidity adjustment facility.
        - In case banks run out of government bonds, RBI allows them to reduce their compliance with SLR, usually up to a limit of 1 percentage point, but with a penalty.
        - The government bonds which are freed up by reducing the compliance with SLR can then be used to borrow money from RBI.
        - However, since these government bonds are a result of non-compliance with SLR, the lending which RBI does against these bonds is done at a penal rate which is usually 0.25% percentage point more than the repo rate.
        - This facility is called the Marginal Standing Facility, and the lending takes place at the penal rate called MSF Rate.

- **Call and notice money**
        - They are unsecured instrument of money market
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 4.jpeg>)
        - Call money is an unsecured, overnight loan between banks and other financial institutions. It is considered the shortest-term money market instrument.
        - Notice money is also an unsecured short-term loan, but with a predetermined notice period for repayment, typically ranging from 2 days to 14 days

- **UNCONVENTIONAL MONETARY POLICY TOOLS**

- **Sterilization operation by RBI- Market Sterilization Scheme (MSS)**
        - When foreigners invest foreign currency in India, they bring foreign currency first, then convert it into domestic currency from the banks, and then invest this domestic currency in the country.
        - Foreign currency assets with Indian banks go up.
        - They do not have much practical use of these foreign currency assets and therefore sell them to RBI and thus RBI prints and issues domestic currency in return.
        - As a result, the amount of money supply goes up.
        - This increase in money supply was not affected by RBI but has happened due to increase foreign investment.
        - This excess money will now cause inflation, and therefore it needs to be sterilized from the economy.
        - RBI issues special bonds called MSS bonds to absorb this excess liquidity from the market, thereby reducing the money supply

- **Interest rates**
        - RBI sets repo rates according to its monetary policy objectives.
        - All other interest rates are determined by the other market institutions based on the repo rate.
        - Thus all other interest rates are some function of the repo rate.

**Qualitative tools of monetary policy**

- **Moral suasion*:**
        - RBI persuades banks to do and not to do something.
    - **Selective credit control*:**
        - RBI Selectively says that a particular sector should not receive credit or should receive it.
        - Rationing of credit
    - **Priority sector lending*:**
        - Out of the total money that the banks lend, some money should be lent to some specific sectors these are known as priority sectors.
        - Presently 40% of the aggregate net credit of banks is to be provided as PSL.

- Sectors part of priority sector include:
        - Agriculture(sub-target of 18% out of 40%).
        - Small and marginal farmers(10 %).
        - MSMEs.
        - Renewable energy, etc.
    - **Change in marginal requirements**
    - **Official and un-officials diktat*.**
        - (* to be referred from the printed material).

**Objectives of control of money supply**

- Broadly the objective of monetary policy are:
    - **Growth:**
        - Through monetary policy, RBI tries to facilitate growth.
        - More money enables the economy to grow faster.
        - More money means more growth.
        - More money will lead to less interest rates and will tempt people to invest more.

- **Inflation:**
        - Through monetary policy, RBI tries to control inflation.
        - More money is bad for prices as it causes a rise in prices.
        - A high amount of money has a contrasting effect on growth and prices.
        - Thus there is a need to have an adequate amount of money level in the economy.
    - With monetary policy RBI tries to ensure that economy remain in 'goldilocks zone'.

- **Conduct of monetary policy:**

|   |   |   |   |   |
|--|--|--|--|--|
|**Growth**|**inflation**|**conduct of monetary policy**|**Effect of monetary policy**|**Nature of monetary policy.**|
|High|High|Reduce money supply to reduce aggregate demand.|Growth cools down and prices also come down.|contractionary policy (that is reduce the money supply) or hawkish stance(money supply may be further tightened in the future).|
|Low|Low|Increases money supply to increase aggregate demand.|Growth is expected to increase and so are the prices.<br><br>The money supply is increased to a level that prices don't go beyond tolerance but growth increases.|It is called Expansionary monetary policy.<br><br>The stance is referred to as a dovish stance.|
|High|Low|Maintain status quo.||Neutral monetary policy|
|Low(recession and high unemployment)(stagflation)|High|Monetary policy is difficult to achieve desirable growth<br><br>Monetary policy becomes largely ineffective.<br><br>Decisions are taken on a case-to-case basis.|If the money supply is increased expect the growth to pick up and also take steps to control prices.<br><br>If the money supply decreases, usually not followed as unemployment may rise.<br><br>Supply-side measures are followed especially to control prices.|unconventional monetary policy with either a dovish or hawkish stance with a bias toward dovish.|

- The basic objective of monetary policy is to facilitate growth by making available adequate money and controlling prices by ensuring that excess money is not there.
    - Monetary policy thus tries to navigate through a growth-inflation trade-off.
    - An increase in the money supply facilitates growth but causes inflation.
    - On the other hand, a decrease in money supply reduces growth but also reduces prices.
    - The decision concerning monetary policy is taken by evaluating growth and inflation together.
    - During the time of stagflation, monetary policy reached its limits, and it become indecisive.
    - If the money supply is increased, it may facilitate growth but also cause inflation and vice-versa.
    - In such times unconventional decisions are taken concerning monetary policy and it has to maintain close coordination with fiscal policy.
    - Monetary policy is essentially a demand-side policy, that controls the demands, however, it also facilitates supply by influencing the interest rates, thus leading to an increase or decrease in investment.
    - When interest rates are low that is money supply is high, more firms would be ready to invest.
    - This would increase the productivity of the economy and lead to more employment, thus improving the overall economy.
    - However at its core monetary policy is considered as a demand-side policy, where an increase in money supply increases the demand for goods and services in the economy.
    - Through control of the money supply, the demand is sought to be controlled.
    - Therefore, since it is a demand-side policy, it is deemed more effective in controlling demand and thus prices.
    - Growth is influenced by multiple factors, one of them is the money supply.
    - It depends upon the decision of the government, the environment of doing business, infrastructure, the quantity and quality of factors of production, etc.
    - Thus money supply is just one among the many factors for growth.
    - On the other hand, the money supply is a very important determinate amongst other determinate of prices.
    - Recognizing the importance of money supply in controlling prices as compared to facilitating growth, it was decided that the primary objective of monetary policy would be inflation targeting.

**Inflation targeting Framework**

- The inflation-targeting framework is an agreement between the government and RBI, signed in 2015.
    - Under which RBI has been made primarily responsible to target inflation based on CPI in 4+/- 2% range.
    - Monetary policy decisions are taken by a 6 member monetary policy committee that decides to increase or decrease money supply through various tools depending on what is the present level of inflation and growth and what they expect to be in the future.
    - Inflation targeting does not mean that growth is no longer the objective, it simply means inflation has to be maintained within the said range.
    - Certainly, monetary policy would also try to meet the goal of growth.

**Monetary policy committee:**

- The monetary policy committee consists of 6 members.
    - 3 members are from RBI and 3 nominated by the government.
    - Decisions are taken by the majority.
    - In case of a  tie RBI governor cast the deceive vote.

**Evaluation of monetary policy**

- Monetary policy is evaluated by seeing how effectively are the decisions of the RBI regarding monetary policy are being transmitted to the economy.
    - For the most part, RBI conducts monetary policy, to change the money supply, via the banking system.
    - If RBI's decisions concerning increase or decrease to money supply are not transmitted by the banks to the economy, we say that monetary policy is less effective or fails.
    - The primary tool of monetary policy is the repo rate.
    - If the repo rate is reduced then RBI signals to increase the money supply by making borrowing cheaper.
    - However, if banks do not reduce their lending rates, then there will not be any increase in money supply as demand will not increase. Thus the monetary policy fails to transmit.
    - To achieve successful transmission, RBI has instructed the banks to move over to the system of MCLR (marginal cost of funds based lending rate)
    - The Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) is a benchmark interest rate used by banks in India to determine the minimum interest rate they can charge on various loans.
    - MCLR reflects the incremental cost of raising funds for a bank, considering different sources like deposits, borrowings, and other liabilities.

**QUANTITATIVE EASING (QE)**

- QE is defined as the exponential rise in the money supply for increasing aggregate demand.
    - QE is an unconventional monetary policy tool, unlike CRR, SLR, Repo Rate, and Reverse Repo rate which are conventional monetary policy tools.
    - Central Banks are forced to resort to QE only for difficult circumstances when the conventional steps fail.
    - The term has been in news after the 2008 financial crisis, which had stemmed from profligate lending by banks and financial institutions to persons with less ability to pay back.
    - QE was used when the efforts of the USA government and Federal Reserve to kick-start the economy by direct cash transfers and increasing market liquidity could not boost the aggregate demand, and a liquidity trap was seen.
    - Federal Reserve start a bond-buying program where it purchased government bonds directly from the government, and also from banks and financial institutions, and it will also purchase safe corporate bonds.
    - Banks get so much flushed with liquidity that they start giving out loans, instead of hoarding the funds in form of bonds.
    - Federal Reserve gives a virtual guarantee to continue the bond-buying spree till demand returns.
    - In around 4 years of QE, Federal Reserve balance sheets had expanded by five times.
    - **Issues**
        - Asset Price Inflation : like stocks and real estate potentially exacerbating wealth inequality.
        - Moral Hazard : encourages excessive risk-taking by financial institutions, as they anticipate central banks will intervene in case of crises.
        - Exit Strategy: Successfully unwinding QE and normalizing monetary policy can be challenging, posing potential risks to financial stability.
        - Consumers: Inflationary impacts can erode purchasing power

- Taper Tantrum: It was the panic created in 2013 when the Federal Reserve indicated that it was going to slow down purchases on government bonds as part of the QE program.
    - It saw the large-scale movement of capital from developing countries to safe-haven assets in developed nations and caused currency fluctuations in many countries including India.

- The **Cantillon effect** refers to the idea that changes in the money supply in an economy causes redistribution of purchasing power among people, disturbs the relative prices of goods and services, and leads to the misallocation of scarce resources. 

## BANKING IN INDIA

- The RBI was set up under the RBI Act 1934.
    - The Banking Regulation Act 1949 entrusts the RBI with the powers to regulate the banks in the country.
        
    - **Universal Bank**: The bank which has the full-fledged banking functions of lending, taking deposits without limits.
    - **Differentiated Banks**- They only perform specific functions of the banks. Some major examples are:
        - Small Finance Bank: They are designated small not as per their area of operation, but as per their scale of operations. 50 % of the loans which the banks will extend can be up to Rs 25 lakh only.
            - 25% branches in unbanked rural area
            - 75% priority sector lending
        - Payment banks**:** Banks set up with the primary function of facilitating payments, and reducing the cost of payments. They cannot loan out money, or issue Credit cards. The money with payment banks can be invested in some safe avenues like gold and government bonds.
        - Wholesale banks : They deal only with very high-value customers, both in terms of lending and deposits.
            - Example Deutsche Bank
        - Custodian banks: They keep custody of someone else’s assets.
        - Scheduled Banks:
            - The banks which have obtained banking licenses by RBI under The Banking Regulation Act 1949.
            - These banks have submitted to greater regulations, in return for more freedom to do banking operations.
            - They are placed in the second schedule of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, hence the name.
        - Non- Scheduled Banks:
            - They are under lesser regulations by RBI and have lesser freedom to do banking operations.
        - Commercial Banks: 
            - The primary objective is to make profits.
        - Nidhi Companies
            - Registered under Companies act 2013
            - Regulated by Ministry of corporate affairs
            - They are not regulated by RBI
        - Cooperative Banks:
            - The primary objective is not profits, but to foster cooperation among the members of the cooperative movement.
            - The depositors are also the owners of the banks.
            - They are initially registered under the Registrar of Cooperative Societies of the respective states.
            - They can later avail banking license by RBI.
            - If a cooperative society is present in more than one state, they will be registered under the Cooperative Acts of the states, as well as the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies.
            - This leads to multiple regulations of a single entity, and as seen in many cases like Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank case, it results in a regulatory vacuum.
            - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 5.jpeg>)
            - State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs)
            - Primary Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (PCARDBs)
            - Short term rural cooperative credit institution lend to individual borrowers
            - Urban cooperative banks(UCB), State cooperative banks(StCB) and District Central cooperative Banks(DCCB) are under the regulation of central government and RBI.
            - PACS, SCARDB, PCARDB are outside the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
            - Urban Cooperative Banks are under the supervision of RBI but supervision of all rural cooperative banks including StCB/DCCB have been delegated to NABARD by RBI.

- Merchant/Investment Banks:
        - They invest their client’s capital in other financial instruments so as to give them profit, in return for a fee.

### FINANCIAL INCLUSION

- Financial inclusion refers to making basic financial products and services readily available and accessible to all individuals and businesses, regardless of their income level, background, or location.

- Financial inclusion is commonly understood in the terms of opening a bank account.
    - Financial inclusion refers to having access to a multitude of financial services at a required time, and at an affordable cost.
    - The need for financial inclusion arises because most of the people in the country have not had access to the world of opportunities that being financially included provides.
    - For example, at the time of independence, and for a long time after that, most of the credit in rural areas was given from non-institutional sources (money lenders).
    - Credit from non-institutional sources is available at a very high rate, and under stringent terms and conditions which are exploitative.
    - Being deprived of financial opportunities, the growth of people is severely restricted, and they fall into a debt trap.
    - This is why financial inclusion is important.
    - Financial inclusion has been a major stated objective behind the nationalization of banks.
    - Financial inclusion essentially comprises of four parts-
        - Having a bank account.
        - To have a set of choices for services those are on offer, i.e. to have access to multiple services and not just one.
        - The choices must be such that they are accessible and affordable, i.e. they must be exercisable at the required time, and at an affordable cost.
        - The individual must also have the ability to choose what is best, through financial literacy.

**REGIONAL RURAL BANKS**

- They were the banks set up to be operational only in rural areas after other banks showed reluctance in opening bank branches in rural areas.
    - They are based out of the Regional Rural Banks Act 1976, after the recommendations of the Narasimhan Committee on rural credit.
    - Three entities came together to set up these banks - Central Government, State Government, and a sponsor bank.
    - The funding required for setting up RRBs is divided into – Central Government (50%), Sponsor Bank (35%), and the State government (15%).

**LEAD BANK SCHEME**

- It was introduced in 1969 to achieve an area-based approach.
    - The designated Lead bank of any area will call timely meetings of representatives of all the other banks of the area, and discuss ways to increase the financial inclusion of the area.

**Some important aspects of Banks**

- **Priority Sector Lending (PSL)** (refer to the qualitative tools of monetary policy)
        - Priority sector lending (PSL) is a regulatory requirement for scheduled commercial banks in India to allocate a specific portion of their credit to certain sectors considered critical for socio-economic development.
        - Priority sector lending requires that banks lend **40% of their ANBC** (Aggregate Net Bank Credit) to sectors designated as priority sectors.
        - There is no requirement of discounted lending on priority sector (PS) loans i.e. PS loans are advanced at the market rate of return and not at some discounted rate.
        - If the government wishes to give a discount, then such a discount may be offered as part of some scheme that the government may announce.
        - For example, there is an **Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS)** under which govt bears some part of the interest cost of the loans given to farmers. The banks receive the full rate of interest, partly from farmers and partly from govt.

- If there is a shortfall in PSL commitment, the banks have two options -
        - First, they can invest the shortfall amount in RIDF of NABARD. NABARD lends money to various financial institutions(and not directly to individuals) for rural development. 
            - One of the ways of lending is through a **Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF)**. Banks contribute to RIDF and NABARD lends money from it. It earns some interest, which is paid to the banks who contributed.
        - Second, banks may also purchase **Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs)** from those banks which overshoot their targets with respect to PSL. 
            - PSLCs can be used as proof by the banks to meet their PSL norms.
            - However, when banks buy PSLCs, they do not purchase the loans from the selling bank. The loans remain on the selling bank’s books.

**Bank Nationalization and its analysis**

- Discussed the performance of Bank nationalization with respect to the objective of financial inclusion.
    - Highlighted the different steps are taken, other than bank nationalization i.e. Jan-Dhan scheme, for increasing financial inclusion.
    - Arguments for Bank Nationalisation:
        - Financial inclusion : directing credit towards priority sectors like agriculture and small businesses
        - Reduces income inequality : Increased access to credit for underprivileged sections
        - Direct credit towards specific national priorities aligned with development goals.
    - Arguments against Bank Nationalisation:
        - Market distortion: Allocation of credit based on political priorities can distort market forces and lead to misallocation of resources.
        - Reduced efficiency and limited innovation: Reduced competition and lack of profit motive can hinder innovation and efficiency.
        - Reduced accountability: Lack of direct market pressure can create less incentive for banks to improve performance and service standards.
    - Consequences
        - Early benefits : increased access for underserved sectors and localities
        - Mixed results:
    - The debate on bank nationalisation is often ideological, with arguments stemming from different economic and political philosophies.

**Evolution of interest rates/ affordability and transmission of monetary policy**

- **Prime Lending Rate (PLR)**
        - PLR was the rate at which prime customers of a bank used to get loans. 
        - PLR was not transparently declared. 
        - It was the rate at which the best customers that is those who had good reputations and good business used to get money from the banks.
        - Since they were given loans at a discounted price, somebody else had to pay a higher price for borrowing.
        - Thus **cross-subsidization** of the rich took place by the others, making the banking services unaffordable.

- **Base rate (BR)**
        - Base rate system started in the 1990s in which the RBI directed the banks to transparently declare the minimum rate which they will charge from any person.
        - This minimum declared rate was called the base rate.
        - Through the transparent declaration, it was ensured that nobody gets a loan below this rate and thus **no cross-subsidization** happens.
        - Further, anybody would get a loan over and above this base rate through an assessment of their risk profile.

- **MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate)**
        - MCLR is a system of transparently declaring the formula to arrive at the base rate.
        - This transparently declared formula must be such that it clearly identifies the **variable cost** for the banks.
        - The variable cost is the marginal cost of funds, which banks need to borrow in order to lend over and above what they can from their deposits. That is why this rate is called MCLR.
        - The borrowing which is undertaken with the intent to further relend is called as financial borrowing. For e.g. Banks, NBFC etc.
        - Banks may borrow money from various sources like other banks, by selling bonds, raising money from the market, borrowing from RBI, etc. at some market rate of interest. 
        - For example, if they borrow from RBI it is called repo rate, if they borrow from other banks such a rate is called call rate which is based on interbank offered rate amongst large institutions at a financial centre. In India this call rate is based on **MIBOR** (Mumbai Inter-Bank Offered Rate).
        - This interest rate at which bank borrows funds form the marginal cost of funds for the banks.

- **External Benchmarking** - To ease compliance with MCLR, RBI introduced external benchmarking. 
        - In it RBI has come up with a list of some external interest rates (external to the banks) to which the banks can benchmark their variable cost.
        - For example, it consists of repo rate, MIBOR, the yield on 10-year govt security, etc. which can be included as the variable cost in the MCLR formula.
        - Once interest rates are determined using some variable cost such as the repo rate, then monetary policy transmission becomes more effective.
        - When the repo rate decreases, MCLR would automatically decrease and vice-versa.
        - It is mandatory for banks and recommendary for NBFC by the RBI.

- **Non Financial Debt** - Excludes the debt of Financial Institutions i.e. those institutions that borrow solely to re-lend and the money.
        - i.e. banks lend the money to relend it is an example of financial debt.

**The merger of Banks**

- Discussed the importance of bank-merger by highlighting the present situation.
    - For Indian firms to become globally competitive, they need finance at a very low cost/interest like it is available in China and other large economies.
    - Thus India needs banks that are globally competitive in lending large capital at competitive rates.

- **Narasimhan Committee** recommended a three-tier bank structure - 
        - There should be 2-3 Large banks that are globally competitive.
        - There should be 8-10 banks at the regional level.
        - There should be 20-25 banks to cater at the local level primarily to the retail segment.

### The health of the banking system

- A bank's health is only as good as its ability to recover interest and principle from the loans advanced by it.
    - If a bank only lends the depositors money, then it will not bear any risk in lending.
    - In order to ensure that banks’ lending is prudent, RBI has laid down certain prudential norms for banks to follow in their lending operations.
    - These prudential norms are largely based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).

**BCBS & Basel 3 Prudential norms**

- BCBS works under the aegis of the Bank of International Settlement located at Basel, Switzerland.
    - It comprises the Central Banks mostly represented by their governors as well as multilateral organizations like IMF.
    - It lays down the regulations which can be implemented by the Central Banks to regulate the financial sector in their respective countries.
    - The first two sets of Basel norms (Basel 1&2) improved the scope of regulation and standardized to some extent regulations of banks throughout the world. 
    - However, the 2008 financial crisis exposed the lacunae in banking regulation and therefore, a comprehensive set of regulatory guidelines in form of Basel 3 were formulated.
    - These guidelines cover multiple risks faced by the banking and the financial industry namely financial risk, market risk, and operational risk i.e. respectively, risk associated with failure of financial operations, failure of the market itself, or any other operational aspect of the business.
    - Basel norms are implemented in India through RBI which lays down the regulatory framework for the banking operations.
    - Broadly, these norms revolve around provisioning requirements and minimum capital requirements.

**Current Iteration: Basel III**

- Capital ratio requirements
    - Liquidity ratios: Introduction of liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to ensure banks have sufficient short-term and long-term funding sources.
    - Leverage ratio: Setting a minimum leverage ratio to act as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.
    - Countercyclical capital buffer: Additional capital requirements that can be imposed during periods of excessive credit growth to prevent financial overheating.
    - Total Capital Requirement Under Basel III ⚖️
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 22.png>)
    - Additional Basel III Requirements 📜

✔ Countercyclical Capital Buffer (0-2.5%) – Extra buffer in economic booms.

✔ Leverage Ratio (≥3%) – Minimum equity to total assets ratio.

✔ Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) – Banks must hold enough high-quality liquid assets to cover 30 days of cash outflows.

- Basic Meaning
        - Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) – 4.5%

•        Highest quality capital (Equity shares, reserves, retained earnings).

•        First to absorb losses in a crisis.

- ✅ Additional Tier 1 (AT1) – 1.5%

•        Perpetual bonds & preferred shares.

•        Can be converted into equity if needed.

- ✅ Tier 2 Capital – 2%

•        Subordinated debt, hybrid instruments, revaluation reserves.

•        Less loss-absorbing than Tier 1.

- ✅ Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) – 2.5%

•        Extra capital reserve to protect banks during financial stress.

•        Cannot be used for dividends or bonuses.

**Provisioning Requirements**

- Booking a provision means that the bank recognises a loss on the loan ahead of time and set aside a proportion of capital to absorb these losses from it's own funds.
    - Provisioning requirements ensure that in case the asset becomes an NPA i.e. the loan is not returned, the banks have their own money from which they can repay the depositors, whose money was lent.
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 23.png>)
        - Lost assets - loss has been identified either by banks or externally (auditors/RBI etc.) but has not been written off.
    - Provisioning coverage ratio - ratio of provisioning to gross NPA.

**Capital Requirements**

- Apart from provisioning banks also have to maintain a minimum amount of capital at all times. 
    - This is implemented through CRAR or CAR.
        - CRAR - Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio, aka CAR - Capital Adequacy Ratio
            - It is the ratio of bank's capital in relation to it's risk weighted assets and current liabilities.
            - Banks are required to maintain at least 9% of their risk-weighted asset as capital at all times. (Basel 3 norm is 8%, whereas, RBI has mandated 9%)
            - Over and above this 9%, banks also have to maintain a CCB (Capital Conservation Buffer) of 2% or their RWA(risk weighted assets) as capital.
                - Capital conservation buffer (CCB) ensures that banks build up capital buffers during normal times (i.e. outside periods of stress) which can be drawn down when losses are incurred during a stressed period.
            - **CRAR pertains to the minimum amount of capital that must always be there with the bank.**
                - If the bank does not have this much capital (9% of its RWA), then the bank is seen to be violating regulations of RBI and is judged to be poor on health.
                - It may then be forced into Prompt Corrective Action (PCA).

A PCA framework is one in which if a bank’s health is assessed to be poor then certain immediate corrective actions are taken.

These include - restrictions on lending activities, restrictions on deposit withdrawal, even a change in management, etc.

##### NPA

- Reserve Bank of India defines Non Performing Assets in India as any advance or loan that is overdue for more than 90 days.
    - "An asset becomes non-performing when it ceases to generate income for the bank".
    - It is classified into Sub-Standard, Doubtful, Loss Asset

- **Twin Balance Sheet Syndrome'** (TBS) is a scenario where banks are under severe stress due to: High levels of non-performing assets (NPAs), high provision requirements, low profits, low capital adequacy ratios (CAR). And corporates are overleveraged to the extent that they might not be able to repay their loans.
        - Causes of the twin balance sheet problem:
            - Rapid economic growth : companies borrow heavily to expand
            - Economic slowdown
            - Regulatory gaps: weak corporate governance and financial regulation

- **Solution ?**
        - Corporate debt restructuring : can help companies to become more sustainable
        - Bankruptcy reforms
        - **4R Framework**
        - Asset Aggregation
            - E.g. Asset reconstruction Companies (ARCs)
        - Government support : Recapitalization of Banks
        - Credit Flow Restoration
        - Economic Revival

- Writing off an asset -
        - Write Down : It refers to permanently reducing the recorded value of an asset on the bank's balance sheet to reflect its current fair market value, which is lower than its original cost.
        - Write-off : when the asset is completely removed from the bank's books because it is deemed to have no remaining value or recovery potential.
        - It helps banks to lower an annual tax bill.

- Special Mention Account (SMA) -
        - SMA are those accounts that shows symptoms of bad asset quality once the account is overdue or before its being identified as NPA.
        - There are three types of SMA when Principal or interest payment or any other amount wholly or partly overdue –
            - SMA0(30 Days), SMA1(60 Days) and SMA2(90 Days).
            - NPA - 91 Days +
        - Stressed Assets = SMA + NPA
        - Gross NPA = Total amount of loan advanced which has become NPA
        - Net NPA = Gross NPA - provisioning for default
            - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 6.jpeg>)

- **To correct the problem of NPAs -**
        - **4R Framework -**
            - Recognize NPAs
            - Resolve NPAs/ Resolution of NPAs
            - Recapitalize the banks
            - Reform the banking system

- **Recognize, Resolve, Recapitalize, Reform**
        - **Recognize**
            - Banks do not recognize the true extent of NPAs and rather they try to evergreen their stressed loans this is so because if a bank recognizes an NPA, it will create a greater requirement on account of provisioning. 
            - This will put the burden on capital available with the bank and therefore will affect the ability of the bank to do business. (since a bank has to maintain a CAR of 9%, therefore, maximum risk-weighted assets that a bank can have are capital/9%)
            - In 2014, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) conducted a comprehensive AQR (asset quality review) was taken up for all the banks to recognize and reveal the true extent of the NPA problem.
                - **Impact of the AQR:**

Spike in NPAs: Due to reclassification of stressed assets, gross NPAs of public sector banks (PSBs) almost doubled after the AQR.

Improved credit discipline: The AQR created a stricter credit culture

- **Reasons for NPA**
        - Wilful Default - when the borrower has the capability to pay but does not pay.
        - General Economic Reasons -
            - Generally poor economic conditions in the country.
            - Poor economic conditions abroad affect export-oriented industries.
            - Sectoral slowdown i.e. in automobiles.
            - Natural disaster i.e. Covid 19.
            - Uncertainties in the policy of the Government i.e. incentivizing renewable may cause in fossil fuel-based energy producers e.g. coal.
            - Poor risk analysis by the lender or the borrower

- **Resolve**
        - Resolution is a process that consists of recovering whatever is due to the banks and also involves the banks taking some losses in the process(haircut).
        - Recovery by the banks is hindered due to their inability to enforce their rights as swiftly as they can.

- **SARFAESI Act, 2002**
        -  Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002
            - Formulated with an intent to empower banks to recover Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) without the intervention of a court
        - *Only for secured loans, not applicable to agricultural loans.
        - It is meant to give explicit recognition to the rights of banks pertaining to secured assets.
        - These rights were already implicit, the acts make them clear and unambiguous.
        - The act also provides for the setting up of Asset reconstruction Companies (ARCs).
        - ARCs are specialized financial institutions that have expertise in recovering whatever can be recovered from a non-performing asset.
        - The rights of banks pertain to -
            - i) Securitisation - Converting a loan into marketable security through the issue of security receipts
                - securitization refers to the process of pooling together financial assets like loans and mortgages, and then issuing securities against them
            - ii) Reconstruction of an asset - Converting non-performing to performing assets.
            - iii) Ability to enforce the interest that the bank has in the security i.e.
                - Take possession of pledged interest.
                - Take over its management, appoint someone who is competent.
                - Ask the debtors of the borrowers to pay their dues.
            - Banks do not have expertise in recovery.
                - If banks recover their dues themselves then they may have to take large losses.
                - Banks enter into an agreement with ARCs which recover as much as can be and take some commission for their duties.
                - Sometimes the bank may even sell an asset to ARC. However, there would be very few entities that have the capability to purchase such bad assets from the banks.
                - At the same time, a bank may be reluctant to sell a bad asset to an ARC after taking a haircut (meaning that selling the loan at a lesser price than what was its value).
            - Since a bank would be reluctant to take losses and especially a public sector bank would not take losses due to fear of allegation of corruption and an ARC would neither buy nor be capable to buy the asset at the price at which the banks want to sell it, ARCs would not be able to function as was envisaged under the Act.

- **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2017**
        - Insolvency is a financial state where an individual or entity is unable to meet their debt obligations as they fall due.
        - Bankruptcy is a legal process initiated by an individual or entity after they are declared insolvent. It involves a court-ordered reorganization or liquidation of their assets to settle debts.

- **When the IBC process is initiated -**
        - The management is kicked out and replaced with new professionals.
        - A Insolvency Professional(IP) is appointed to resolve the dispute.
        - It is tasked to prepare a plan for resolution.
        - This plan is proposed to the CoC(committee of creditors).
        - CoC with a special majority(66%) may approve or reject the plan.
        - Within 180 days + 90 days (extension) - Max 270 days there must be a plan that is accepted by CoC.
            - It was extended to 330 days with an amendment, it also made provision for continuing the insolvency process even In case of litigation.
        - If there is no such plan accepted by CoC, assets will be liquidated to the extent the payment has to be done.
        - National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is stipulated as an Adjudicating authority (AA)
        - Objectives:
            - Resolve insolvency efficiently and time-boundly: Aims to resolve insolvency within 365 days with clear timelines for each stage.
        - Key features:
            - Fast-track insolvency resolution process: Defines clear roles and responsibilities for Insolvency Resolution Professionals (IRPs), creditors, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI).
            - Corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP): through various options like debt restructuring, mergers & acquisitions, or liquidation.

- Issue
        - NPA with large amount are extending beyond the stipulated time due to litigation.
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 24.png>)

- **Recapitalization of banks**
        - Banks are required to possess a minimum amount of capital for complying with the CAR norms and to set aside money while lending on account of provisioning.
        - If banks do not have an adequate amount of capital, they will not be able to carry out their business of lending and hence may fail.
        - To recapitalize banks, so that they can continue their business of lending to the economy, various ways of capitalization can be pursued.
        - These are -
            - **Selling of equities** - the owner e.g. the govt may sell its equity in the bank and then used the money collected and infuse it in the bank as capital. However, selling equity poses political difficulty due to concerns of privatization. Further, if govt’s shareholding falls below 50%, there may be a chance of a hostile takeover. Also, the valuation at which equity is sold is also debatable and therefore may lead to allegations regarding selling govt assets at a less than their fair value.
            - **Through budgetary & extra-budgetary support** - govt by virtue of being the largest shareholder in PSBs can also provide capital to the banks. However, since govt’s own resources are strained, not much help can be provided through this route.
            - **Via Recapitalization Bonds** - Even though banks are under-capitalized, they can still lend to the govt without any strain or additional requirement of capital. Since the govt is deemed as a zero risk entity, lending to govt does not add to a bank’s risk-weighted assets or create any provisioning requirements. Govt borrows from banks by issuing recap bonds. The govt receives this borrowed money and then by virtue of being the owner, infuses this money back into the banks in form of capital. This way a bank's deposits (liability) are returned to the bank via the govt as capital.
                - *borrowing via Recap bonds increases the total borrowing of the govt and therefore, its public debt increases. The ability of govt to borrow more for its own purposes thus reduces. This is the risk or cost that the govt bears to recapitalize banks.
                - *Borrowing under this scheme is outside the limits prescribed under the FRBM Act.
            - Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs)

- **Reform of banking system**
        - It refers to improving the lending practices and overall work culture in the PSBs.
        - What reform entails as a core principle is to eliminate the interference of the owner i.e. govt in banking operations.
        - This is sought to be implemented by increasing the distance between the Ministry of Finance (govt) and the executive decision-making body of the PSBs.
        - Under **Mission Indradhanush** it is proposed to set up a separate **BHC (Bank Holding Company)** - a special company that will be set up to hold govt shareholding in the PSBs i.e. one more entity between the owner and the bank.
        - Till the time BHC is not set up, interference is sought to be reduced via a **BBB (Bank Board Bureau)** which is responsible for appointments to senior positions in PSBs. It is replaced by Financial Services Institutions Bureau.
    - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 25.png>)
        - Payment gateway acts as a secure bridge that verifies and transmits payment information safely but doesn't hold any money itself.
            - E.g. Razor pay, PayPal
        - Payment Aggregator acts as both the gateway and a temporary money holder, allowing features like one-click payments and easier refunds.
            - CcAvenue
            - PayZapp
            - AmazonPay
        - Payment Gateways are entities that provide technology infrastructure to route and facilitate processing of an online payment transaction without any involvement in the handling of funds. They only handle the transfer of data between the entities in a transaction.
        - However, payment aggregators may also provide services that include the generation of settlements via netting of the funds received by the merchants onboarded by them. By being the bridge between consumers at one end and merchants at the other end, these service providers play a role in processing and completion of the payment transactions.

### Insurance sector

- Insurance density -  the ratio of premiums collected by insurance companies to the country's population per capita.
    - Insurance penetration - the ratio of insurance premiums to the GDP of country.
        - Economic Survey - It increased from 2.7 per cent around 2000 to 4.2 per cent in 2020 and 2021.

# Govt Budgeting and Fiscal Policy

- What is a budget?
        - Statement of estimated receipts and expenditures of the government in respect of every financial year.
        - Planning of expenditure keeping in view the income earned.
        - **Objectives** behind the budgeting -
            - Expenditure/Allocation function - to provide benefits to the needy
            - Taxation function - to achieve more equitable wealth distribution
            - Stabilization function - The government may need to correct fluctuations in income and employment

- **Various Techniques of Govt Budgeting**
        - **Line Item Budgeting**
            - Simply presenting the items of expenditure. Maintain a list of items on which expense has been incurred. Pure accountancy concept. Does not convey much information about the objectives and their achievements. E.g. For Health Department 10Cr layout for vaccination of children under 5.
        - **Performance budgeting**
            - Schemes/Programs are analysed based on their performance, i.e. efficiency – How much was budgeted, how much has been spent, and were the targets met? E.g. Out of 10 Cr. spent on vaccination, how many children were vaccinated? Budget for, say, all new-borns v/s able to vaccinate only 50% of them.
        - **Outcome Budgeting**
            - More than efficiency and output, outcomes are analysed- Does the expenditure achieve the ultimate objective for which it was laid out? E.g. Vaccination received approval for expenditure to reduce child mortality. Did mortality of children come down after vaccination?
        - **Zero Based Budgeting**
            - Analysing every expenditure from the base every year. Just because some schemes got allocation in a previous year does not mean that it will be continued and allocated new expenditure in the subsequent year. It needs to be reanalysed every year afresh on its performance.
                - While allocating expenditure for any scheme, the finance ministry looks for the analysis regarding the schemes’ performance. Only when it is satisfied that the scheme is running properly i.e. the expenditure is producing the desired outcomes, will the money be allocated to the schemes this year. It is as if every year the expense of the scheme is justified like a new scheme.
        - **Gender Budgeting**
            - Gender budgeting is analysing various budgetary expenses for their gender sensitivity i.e. what differential impact will particular expenses have for different genders.

### Accounting in Government Budget

- On 1st Feb (Present year, 2022) - **Budget Estimate** for FY 2022-23 (from 1st April 2022 to 31st March 2023), **Advance Estimate** of the ongoing financial year (e.g. FY2021-22), **2nd Advanced Estimate/Actuals** for the previous year FY e.g. FY2020-21.
    - Art 112 of our constitution requires that the Annual Financial Statement distinguish the expenses between revenue and other accounts.
    - The government budget is seen to be comprised of two parts as demonstrated below -
    - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 26.png>)
        - **Revenue Account**
            - **Revenue Expenses**
                - Expenses incurred while performing essential government functions.
                - Revenue expenses are those which are incurred in the performance of the sovereign functions of the government i.e. those in maintenance and upkeep of government and those incurred in providing various public goods such as subsidies.
                
            - **Revenue Receipts**
                - Money received as a matter of right of the government.
                - Revenue receipts are those which government receives as a matter of right. These belong to the government i.e. cannot be claimed from the government. These include taxes collected and non-tax revenue such as fines, fees, interest received on lending by the government, dividends, profits received from various sources, etc.
        - **Capital Account**
            - **Capital Expenses**
                - Expenses that have an effect on assets and liabilities.
                - Any expenditure which results in either creation of an asset or reduction of a liability e.g. expenditure incurred in the construction of a highway, a port, in the creation of a govt company or a joint venture, etc., similarly expenditure incurred in repayment of a loan’s principle.

- **Capital Receipts**
        - Receipts that have an effect on assets and liabilities.
        - Any receipt resulting from either reduction of an asset or creation of a liability e.g. money received by selling a govt company, or a govt building, or by borrowing money, etc. - all create an inflow of money for the government on account of capital receipts.

- We classify capital receipts into two parts -
        - Debt creating Capital Receipts - which creates debt/liability.
        - Non-Debt creating Capital Receipts - which does not create debt/liability.

- **Plan & Non-planned classification**
        - Only for the expenditure side of the budget.
        - Relevant for Planned Economy. Expenditures part of Five Year Plans were considered plan expenditure and rest non-plan expenditure.
        - This approach had many accounting issues.
        - **Rangarajan Committee, 2012,**  recommended doing away with this approach.
            - The recommendation was implemented in 2015 and since then this practice has been stopped.

**Deficit**

- Budget deficit = Total expenditure - Total revenue
    - Since 1997, the use of the Budget deficit concept has been done away with.
        - Hence as per accounting principles, budget deficit is supposed to be always zero.
    - Fiscal deficit = Debt creating Capital Receipts (Total borrowing) = Total Expenditure - (Revenue Receipts + Non-Debt creating Capital Receipts)

**Types of deficits**

- **On the basis of financing**
        - Budget deficit
            - Budget deficit (BD) = Total expenditure - Total Receipt = (Revenue Expenditure + Capital Expenditure) - (Revenue Receipt + Capital Receipt) = 0
        - Monetised deficit
            - That part of the budget deficit that is monetized by printing currency is called a monetized deficit.
            - Before 1997, Govt used to present a budget in deficit.
            - This meant that the government used to arrange for the extra expenditure by printing government bonds and forcing the RBI to buy them.
            - This undermined RBI's independence as a monetary authority as it couldn’t control the supply of money according to its own assessment.
            - Also, this practice elected govt could be indisciplined in this borrowing and expenses without any cost.
            - The budget thus became a tool of political popularism through promises of expenses without actually having the money to spend.

- **Ways and Means Advance**
        - In 1997, RBI and Govt. Signed an agreement under which the Govt.
        - Agreed to not present any budget deficit so that independence and credibility of RBI can be enhanced.
        - Under this RBI would provide temporary loans to the government so that it could deal over any temporary mismatches in liquidity.
        - They are repayable within 3 months from the date of making an advance.
        - The money to be lent was predetermined as was the interest on it.
        - Normal WMA - clean advance - no collateral.
        - Special WMA - against the collateral of the government
        - A similar facility was provided to the state as well under which RBI gives SDL (State Development Loan) to the states.

- **On the basis of the type of transaction**
        - **Fiscal deficit (FD)** = Total borrowing by the government in a year = Fiscal deficit = debt capital Receipts.
            - **Gross Fiscal**
                - FD = total expenditure-non debt receipt = revenue expanse + (capital expense) - (Revenue Receipt+ non Debt CR)
                - Gross FD = total borrowing of the Government in the year.
            - In Govt expenditure, some of it is in form of the loan that govt gives.
            - Loans given by the government are subtracted from Gross FD to arrive at net FD.
        - **Net fiscal deficit:** Net Fiscal deficit is equal to GFD minus loans given by the government.
        - **Primary deficit (PD) = FD - Interest Payment**
            - The government borrows money every year which is a fiscal deficit for that year.
            - This borrowing keeps on getting accumulated in form of debt of the government.
            - In this debt, the government has to pay interest.
                - Interest Costs are the largest component of government expenditure.
                - Interest cost on autonomous interest that is it is not discretionary for the government to not pay interest.(charged on CFI), i.e. they are charged on consolidated fund of India
            - In the present year, the present government is liable to pay interest on borrowing incurred by the previous government in past.
            - Interest payments are subtracted from the fiscal deficit to arrive at a primary deficit.

- **Gross primary deficit = Gross FD - interest payment**
    - Net Primary Deficit is equal to gross primary deficit minus lending by the government.

|   |   |
|--|--|
|Net = Gross - lending by government||

- **Revenue Deficit: RD = RE - RR**
        - It reflects the deficit incurred by the government with respect to maintaining itself from its rightful incomes.
        - FRBM Act talked about eliminating revenue deficit in 5 years from 2003.
        - The government was unable to meet the targets with respect to fiscal deficit and revenue deficit.
        - It came up with the concept of effective revenue deficit to replace the target for revenue deficit in FRBM Act.

- **Effective Revenue Deficit(ERD) = Revenue Deficit - Transfers to state or creation of capital assets.**
        - Central government expenditure on revenue accounts also consists of its transfers to states for various purposes, such as for the implementation of schemes.
        - Some of that money is transferred from center to state for the purpose of creation of capital assets.
        - This money even though categorized as revenue expenditure for the centre is essentially being used for the creation of capital assets that is it is of nature of capital expenses.
        - Hence it is subtracted from the revenue Deficit to arrive at an effective revenue Deficit.
        - **Similarly, Effective Capital Expenditure** = Capital Expenditure by Central Govt. + Grants given to states for creation of capital assets.

**NK Singh committee recommendations (FRBM Act Review):**

- The FRBM Review Committee headed by former Revenue Secretary, NK Singh was appointed by the government to review the implementation of FRBM.
    - The Committee suggested that a rule-based fiscal policy by limiting government debt, fiscal deficit, and revenue deficits to certain targets is good for fiscal consolidation in India.
    - **The public debt to GDP ratio should be considered as a medium-term anchor for fiscal policy in India.** The combined debt-to-GDP ratio of the centre and states should be brought down to 60 percent by 2023 (comprising of 40 percent for the Centre and 20% for states) as against the existing 49.4 percent, and 21 percent's respectively.
    - **Fiscal deficit as the operating target:** The Committee advocated fiscal deficit as the operating target to bring down public debt.
        - For fiscal consolidation, the centre should reduce its fiscal deficit from the current 3.5% (2017) to 2.5% by 2023.
            - Justifying the target of 2.5% to be realized in the next six years, the Committee observed that debt sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted for the central government suggests such a target (for fiscal deficit) will help to achieve the public debt target of 40% for the centre by 2023.
    - **Revenue deficit target:** The Committee also recommends that the central government should reduce its revenue deficit steadily by 0.25 percentage (of GDP) points each year, to reach 0.8% by 2023, from a projected value of 2.3% in 2017.
        - The Committee advised the government to follow the golden rule here i.e., not to finance the government’s day-to-day expenditure through borrowings.
        - Revenue deficit implies financing of the government’s day-to-day activities from borrowings.
    - **Formation of Fiscal Council to advise the government.** The Committee advocated the formation of institutions to ensure fiscal prudence in accordance with the FRBM spirit.
        - It recommended setting up an independent Fiscal Council.
    - **Escape Clause to accommodate countercyclical issues:** The NK Singh Committee points out that there are disadvantages with set fiscal deficit target if some economic instabilities like an external crisis affect the Indian economy.
        - For example, the government has to spend more during the time of a recession, and hence it need not restrict its borrowing to keep the fiscal deficit target. Hence, the committee advocates countercyclical covers in fiscal policy while following the FRBM.

**Varies aspects of government expenses**

- **Composition of Expenditure**
        - **Central Sector Schemes**
            - They are the schemes that are entirely and directly funded and executed by the central government.
            - The schemes are formulated by the Centre, based on subjects from the Union List.
            - Besides, there are some other programs that various Central Ministries implement directly in States and UTs which also comes under Central Sector Schemes.
            - In these schemes, the financial resources are not shifted to states.

- **Examples of Central Sector Scheme**
        - Some examples of Central Sector Schemes include Bharatnet, Namami Gange - National Ganga Plan, LPG connection to poor households, Crop Insurance Scheme, recapitalization of public sector banks, family welfare schemes, labour welfare schemes, National Means cum Merit Scholarship Scheme, National Scheme for Incentive to Girl Child for Secondary Education, interest subsidy for short term credit to farmers, MRTS and metro projects, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and 222er credit guarantee funds, etc.

- **Central Sponsored Schemes (CSS)**
        - Centrally Sponsored Schemes on the other hand are schemes that are implemented by state governments.
        - However, the cost of these schemes is borne on a shared basis in the ratio of 50:50, 70:30, 75:25, or 90:10. Under the cost ratio, the larger portion is always borne by the Centre.
        - CSS is a system under which the center assists the state government financially to get schemes implemented.

- **Kinds of Central Sponsored Schemes and Ministries/Departments**
        - **The core of the Core Schemes:** 
            - National Social Assistance Programme (Department of Rural Development)
            - Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (Department of Rural Development)
            - Umbrella Scheme for Development of Scheduled Castes (Department of Social Justice and Empowerment)
            - Umbrella Programme for Development of Scheduled Tribes (Ministry of Tribal Affairs)
            - Umbrella Programme for Development of Minorities
            - Umbrella Programme for Development of Other Vulnerable Groups
        - **Core Schemes:**
            - Green Revolution  (Krishi Unnati Schemes and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana) (Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare)
            - White Revolution (Animal Husbandry and Dairying) (Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying, and Fisheries)
            - Blue Revolution (Integrated Development of Fisheries)
            - Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana (Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying, and Fisheries)
            - Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)(Department of Rural Development)
            - Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana (PMAY)

**Discussion on Fiscal deficit and Government borrowing**

- **Public debt**- implies government debt.
        - The amount received by the government is called borrowing.
    - **Other liabilities** - money that government holds as a trustee e.g. PF account deposits.
        - Pubic debt consists of internal debt and external debt.
        - Internal debt raised through G -sec.
        - External debt can be in rupee or foreign currency.
        - Most of the external debt is dollar-denominated.
        - Bonds that are short term are called G-sec or G-bond.
        - Treasury bills do not pay any interest.
        - The only central government can issue Treasury bills and not state government.
        - Components of public debt - public debt and other liabilities.

- **Public debt** refers to money borrowed by the government.
        - G-Sec(government dated securities), T-Bill, External Assistance, Short term borrowings comprises of public debt.
        - Usually, we refer to only central government borrowing.
        - When we include state government it is called general government debt.
        - **Other liabilities** - these are monies held by the government as a  trustee.
            - The money belongs to the people/depositor, but the government held it for some period and pays interest.
            - E.g. money held in the national small saving fund, PF, pension fund etc
            - Public debt comprises - an internal debt I.e. - money owed to the resident.
            - The government issues government bonds and these are purchased by many domestic entities.
            - Many times government issues short term securities called G- sec and treasury bills.
            - These are issued for a very short tenure and normally do not pay any interest.
            - They are rather issued at a discount to face value and are repaid at their face value.
            - State government cannot issue treasury bills - Refer to sources of deficit financing from slides.
            - Market borrowings are the largest component, securities against small savings are the second-largest component.
            - The external debt of a country is different from the external debt of the government of the country.
            - The government's external debt is called external public debt or sometimes sovereign debt.
            - Whereas the external debt of the country as a whole is called external debt.

- As such external public debt is just one component of external debt.
    - Other components include Borrowings by private and other non-government entities from foreign sources, such as external commercial bonds or borrowing (ECB), bonds issued in a foreign market - foreign currency or domestic currency denominated.

- **External public debt** - consist of borrowing by the government from non-residents, such as from FII which purchase government bonds, multilateral and other agencies like the world bank and IMF, foreign countries etc.
    - **External debt** can be both foreign currency-denominated or domestic currency denominated.
    - **Masala bonds** -These are offshore rupee-denominated bonds I.e. bonds issued by Indian entities in foreign markets but which are denominated in rupees.
        - It means that the foreigner will lend money in rupees and will receive the payment back in rupees.
        - It is their responsibility to convert rupees into their domestic currency.
        - Therefore they bear the exchange rate risk.

**Rahn Curve**

- Rahn curve establishes the relationship between economic growth and government’s spending as a per cent of GDP
    - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 27.png>)

- **Government's role in stabilizing the business cycle**
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 28.png>)

- **Crowding in and crowing out**
        - Crowding-in is a phenomenon that occurs when higher government spending leads to an increase in economic growth and therefore encourages firms to invest due to the presence of more profitable investment opportunities.
        - The crowding out effect is an economic theory that argues that rising public sector spending drives down or even eliminates private sector spending. This is due to increased cost of borrowing as government borrows money increasing the cost of capital.

## Taxation - Types of taxes

- **Taxes on the basis of distributive features -**
        - **Progressive tax-** A tax in which the rate of tax is higher on larger amounts of money.
            - In a progressive tax system, rich people pay a higher percentage of their income as taxes than do poor people.
        - **A proportional tax** - A proportional tax is an income tax system that levies the same percentage tax to everyone regardless of income.
            - **Russia:** Russia has a flat income tax rate of 13%.
            - Self-employed persons pay 4-6% on turnover.

- **A regressive tax** - A regressive tax is a tax taking a larger percentage of income from low-income earners than from high-income earners.
    - **Taxes on the basis of the bearer of burden -**
        - **Direct Tax** - A direct tax is a tax that a person or organization pays directly to the entity that imposed it. e.g. include income tax, real property tax, personal property tax.
            - Levied on individuals or legal persons.
        - **Indirect Tax-** Indirect tax is a tax that can be passed on to another individual or entity e.g. GST.
            - Levied on goods and services before they reach the consumer, who ultimately pays for indirect tax
    - **Ad valorem tax** - An ad valorem tax is a tax based on the assessed value of an item.
        - E.g. at sales tax, VAT, Property tax.
    - **Specific tax** - A specific tax is a fixed amount of tax based on a specific feature of an item e.g. length of car or cigarette.
        - Weight, measurement

- **Direct taxes**
        - **Income tax -** Income tax is a tax charged on the annual income earned by an individual.
            - Levied by central government and burden is on earner.
        - **Corporate Income Tax** - Corporation tax is a tax imposed on the net income of the company
            - Levied by central government and burden is on the company.
        - **Minimum alternate tax** - tax that came into existence to check tax evasions.
            - Minimum Alternate Tax is a direct tax imposed on companies so that they mandatorily pay a minimum amount of tax to the government.
        - **Wealth tax** - A wealth tax is a tax based on the market value of assets owned by a taxpayer.
            - Currently, it is not levied in India.
        - **Professional Tax** - levied by the state on professions.
        - **Capital gains tax**- A capital gain tax is the tax levied on the increase in a capital asset's value and is realized when the asset is sold.
        - **Tobin tax -** tax levied on spot currency conversions or short term currency transaction, in order to disincentivise speculation and reduce volatility.

- **Indirect taxes -**
        - **Excise duty -** is levied on production.
            - Levied by centre and burden is on the consumer.
        - **Customs duty -** levied when goods change of international boundary.
            - Levied by centre and burden is on the consumer.
        - **Octroi** tax / Entry tax is charged when goods change domestic boundaries.
            - Levied by state/district/municipalities and burden is on the consumer.
        - **Sales/VAT/Service tax** is charged on the sale of goods.
            - Levied by state and burden is on the consumer.
        - **Central sales tax** - interstate sale of goods.
            - Levied by centre but given entirely to states.
            - The burden is on consumers.

**Value Added Tax(VAT):**

- Value Added Tax (VAT), also known as Goods and Services Tax (GST) in some countries, is a consumption tax levied on the value added to goods and services at each stage of the production and distribution chain.
    - Our current supply chain is the producer to wholesaler to retailer and then to the consumer.
    - Let's say the value of good at the intermediate end is Rs1000 on this excise duty is 10%(which is levied by and collected by the center).
        - So the value of the sale is 1100. So if there is a 10% sales tax, then produces but this intermediate good in 1210 in total.
        - If the producer adds the value of 290, the total value is 1500, and excise duty has to be paid by produces is 150
        - Producer will sell it to a wholesaler in 1500 + 150 = 1650, and wholesaler pays a sales tax of 165, s total cost is 1815.
        - If the wholesaler sells it to 1900, therefore, the value of sales tax will be 190, the retailer will pay 1900+190= 2090.
        - If the retailer sells it into 2200, then 220 will be again sales tax, then the total price paid by the customer is 2420.
    - It shows that there was a tax on tax or cascading effect of taxation in the supply chain.
        - It was highly unfair to the consumers. 
    - If such a high tax has to be paid by the consumer then it leads to tax evasion by the consumers. No one will disclose the actual production and sales.
    - So if high tax incidence then tax evasion is high.
        - It was a tax on tax or double taxation. It means even the tax that has been paid is also taxed again.
        - It was realized by the govt that our tax system does not inspire tax compliance and there is a need to reform the taxation system.
        - So it was decided that rather than taxing the entire value we should tax only the value addition at each stage. 
    - Such a tax is called Value added tax.
    - But there is a problem that there are multiple taxing agencies and bodies along with the local bodies which makes it even more complex.
    - VAT simply refers to sales tax levied in a value-added manner.
        - After 2010 all the states started to apply VAT instead of sales tax. meaning only the value-added at each stage is being taxed.
        - But it started a new challenge as rates of VAT for different goods & services were different as these were decided by the states governments.
    - In 2008, GST was proposed as VAT does not solve the problem of complexities due to different taxing agencies. 
    - In this the tax will be paid on the entire value and a refund will be paid for the tax already paid as a tax credit or input tax credit.
    - GST is essentially a tax in which all other indirect taxes are subsumed by reducing the event of taxation into only one.
    - Custom duty is still paid separately. Custom duty is not part of GST.
    - GST is jointly implemented by centres & states.
        - It reduces the cost of compliance and increases the cost of non-compliance.

**Revenue Neutral Rate(RNR)**

- The rate at which tax revenue remains the same despite giving credit of duty paid on inputs and other factors. It is the rate of tax that allows the Government to receive the same amount of money despite changes in the tax laws.
    - It ensures no loss of revenue to the government as compared to the earlier tax collection.
    - It helps us to explain tax buoyancy and tax elasticity.
    - RNR =R/B, R is equal to revenues (both Centre and state) generated from existing sales and excise taxes, which will be replaced by the GST, B is the total tax base for generating the required GST revenues.
    - It is fixed by GST council

**Laffer Curve:**

- It is the relationship between the tax rate and total tax collection.
    - It shows that if tax is too high or too low then there will be no taxable gain to the government.
    - There is some optimum rate of tax at which tax revenue is maximized.
    - It is unique for each economy.

**Tax Buoyancy and Tax Elasticity**

- Tax Buoyancy : It is the growth of tax collection rate with respect to GDP growth.
        - It refers to the responsiveness of tax revenue growth to changes in GDP.
        - When a tax is buoyant, its revenue increases without increasing the tax rate.
        - **Tax Buoyancy = Growth rates of taxes/Growth rate of the economy.**
    - Tax Elasticity: It is a simple general term. It means the growth rate of taxes on change in taxation regime.
        - **Tax Elasticity: Growth rates of taxes/ Change in the tax regime.**

**Tax Evasion:**

- Any case of non-compliance is most of the time is the exploitation of existing laws.
        - That means finding loopholes in the laws.
        - It is illegal practice. (contrasted with tax avoidance which is legal)

- BEPS: Base Erosion profit shifting - it is a generic term in which the companies try to shift their tax burden to some other place where there is a low tax or evade tax.
        - Undermines the fairness and integrity of tax systems
        - Companies gain a competitive advantage vis-a-vis domestic players
        - Majorly impact developing countries heavily relying on corporate tax
        - OCED suggests minimum 15% corporate tax rate globally.

- To avoid this BEPS governments or tax authorities sign the **Advance Pricing Agreement** in which the firms agree to have pricing policies that will be fair.
    - Other government measures
        - Double taxation avoidance agreement(DTAA) with foreign governments to provides for relief from double taxation
        - Constitution of Special Investigation Team (SIT)
        - Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2015

- These are methods to avoid tax evasion.
        - Tax rate should be reduced and increase the tax base
        - Simplify tax laws
        - Cover loopholes
        - Positive and welcoming environment for paying taxes and discharging duties.
        - To avoid these international tax evasion and other issues there are many international multilateral agreements among the governments

## Financial Markets

- In general, **finance** refers to the availability of money when and if needed, be it for investment or consumption, be it someones own or taken from outside.
    - In the simplest term, **currency** refers to anything which is accepted as a generalised medium of exchange which means everyone will accept it.
    - The quantitative value of currencies one has directly is called **cash** or indirectly in form of other **assets.**
    - The total value of money at the disposal of an individual is called **wealth.**
    - **Capital** refers to anything which increases the income, that is why, be it for countries or companies or individuals, capital formation is the key.

![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 30.png>)

- For **capital formation** saving is necessary. If the savings are higher it will result in higher capital formation and more income with more savings and that is called a **virtuous cycle** of growth. But what if there are no savings, there will not be capital formation and one will remain in a trap that is called a **low income or poverty trap.**

- Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), also known as investment, reflects the value of newly acquired fixed assets by businesses, governments, and households within an economy during a specific period (usually a year).
        - What types of assets are included?
            - Land improvements: Fences, ditches, drainage systems, etc.
            - Plant, machinery, and equipment: New factories, machinery, vehicles, etc.
            - Construction: Roads, bridges, buildings, residential housing, etc.
            - Net acquisitions of valuables: Intangible assets like patents or licenses.
        - What types of assets are excluded?
            - Existing assets (second-hand purchases)
            - Land itself (only improvements are counted)
            - Inventories (stock of goods not yet sold)
            - Financial assets (stocks, bonds, etc.)
        - Gross indicates that it does not deduct the deprecation of existing capital assets.

- To come out of this poverty trap, it is advisable that capital should be taken from outside so there could be **two types of capital:**
        - **Tier 1:** It is someone's own
        - **Tier 2:** It is taken from the outside. 
    - The way this capital is managed can be called financial arrangements and the very place where these finances are made available by bringing the one who is seeking finance and the one who wants to invest at one place is called the **financial market.**
    - The financial market can be subdivided into two:
        - **1. Debt market-** finance is made available in form of loans
        - **2. Equity market-** finance is made available in form of equity or partnership
    - Yet another classification of financial market is possible in **terms of time:**
        - **1. Money market** - If the deal/transaction is for a period of up to 1 year, it is called a Money market
        - **2. Capital market -** If the deal or transaction is for more than one year, it is called a Capital market.
    - Yet another classification of financial market is possible in **terms of issuance of financial instruments:**
        - **1. Primary market-** When it is issued for the first time
        - **2. Secondary market-** when already issued instruments are bought and sold (stock market)

**Bill of exchange, Promissory notes, Bonds and securities**

- A bill of exchange is a written instrument that serves as an unconditional order to pay a specific sum of money at a fixed or determinable future time. Think of it as a promissory note with three distinct parties involved
        - Drawer : person who issues the bill and instructs the payment
        - Drawee : person who is instructed to make the payment
        - Payee : person who ultimately receives the payment

- **A promissory note** is where one party requests the other to give loans or to delay the process of repayment. In the case of the promissory note, the bearer is not accepted as per RBI.
        - Both the bill of exchange and promissory notes are legal documents as per the Payment and Settlement Provisions and any dispute that arises can be taken to court under the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 (amended 2018).

- A promissory note is a written promise, whereas a bill of exchange is a unconditional written order. The promissory note allows no copies, whereas a bill of exchange can have multiple copies. Two or more parties can be involved in a bill of exchange, but a promissory note only involves two parties.

- **Bonds and securities**
        - A bond is a debt instrument issued by governments or corporates to raise loans over a given period of time.
        - If a bond is well received and trusted among the investors, it can be called a **Gilt bond** and if the investors are sceptic about bond , it can be called a **junk bond**.
        - How good/trustworthy a bond is decided by the input of various **credit rating agencies.**

- **Bonds of money market (CT)**
        - They are regulated by RBI.
        - In the money market they are issued for a time span of less than a year in the following ways:
        - **If issued by government/Treasury Bills** - Treasury Bills are the securities issued by central government only for a period of 91 days, 182 days or 364 days. They are issued at discount. For example: if the face value of a treasury bill is Rs 100, it may be sold in Rs 98 and at maturity Rs 100 is redeemed(hence a profit of Rs 2). As in such bonds, no coupons/interests is given, they are also called **zero-coupon bonds.**

- In 2010, for less than 91 days **Cash Management Bills(CMBs**) have been introduced which are issued at a discount on face value. (Earlier there used to be 14 days ad-hoc treasury bills also, but they are discontinued now since 1997) to meet the temporary cash flow of the government, they are issued by Central government.

- **If issued by a Company, they are called commercial paper**. As these commercial papers are non secured(without any guarantee), the credit rating needs to be very good of the issuer.
        - Issued for up to 1 yr. to cover short term receivables and meet short term financial obligations.
        - They are issued in denominations of 5 lakhs.

specified time period.

- **Debt instruments in capital market**
        - Regulated by SEBI
        - In the capital market, they can be issued by the central government, state governments and companies.
        - If issued by the central government called **Dated securities.**
        - If issued by state government called **SDLs - State Development Loans.**
        - If issued by companies, they are known as **Corporate bonds or Debentures.**
        - They can be of the following 3 types in case of dated securities and SDLs:
            - **1. Fixed coupon bonds** where the rate of interest is fixed.
            - **2. Floating coupon bonds** where the rate of interest or coupon is flexible and is notified at certain intervals by the issuer.
            - **3. Inflation-indexed coupon bonds -** They were introduced in 2013 at the onset of the taper tantrum of the USA. (Taper tantrum refers to that exercise of altering the bond market to contain inflation). As a result of the taper tantrum, In India also inflation increased and investors moved to gold. To balance that inflation-indexed bonds were issued where the rate of interest/coupon was benchmarked with inflation. Generally, these bonds are for a period of 5 yrs to 40 years.
                - However, sometimes there is no maturity period given such bonds are called **perpetual or consol bonds** and as are issued during the war also called as **war bonds.**
    - **Debentures** may be fixed or floating or attached to external benchmarks. They could be secured or non secured.

**Who can invest in Government securities and how?**

- These Government bonds and many of the corporate bonds are sold over the counter which means there are certain physical or digital counters where they can be purchased in primary and secondary markets.
    - However, some of them are available in the Stock market also.
    - G-secs issued by a government are managed by RBI, be it central govt or SDL.
        - For this purpose, RBI uses NDSOM (Negotiated dealing system order matching) and Clearing Corporation of India CCI works as depository participant and clearinghouse.
    - Depository participants refer to that institution that takes care of all the bond share issues as there is no physical transfer.
    - Clearinghouse refers to that institution that clears the debit and credit once trading is done.
    - Generally, the banks, primary dealers, and big-ticket investors.
    - Recently in a very revolutionary step this primary security market has been opened to even retail investors (minimum investment is 10000).
        - Earlier retail investors were only allowed to invest in G-Sec through secondary market (stock market)
    - For this purpose, the investor can open RDG (retail direct gilt account) which is a kind of Demat.
    - **Advantages**
        - Direct Access : reduces costs and complexities

    - Since 1995, they are using NSE Automated Trading (NEAT) platform.
    - Their sensitive index consists of the top 50 companies called Nifty50.
    - Additionally, there is Nifty Next 50 or Nifty Junior consisting next 50 companies.

**Multi Commodity Exchange ( MCX):**

- It came into existence in 2003 and it deals with non-agricultural commodity derivatives.
    - It can be subdivided into- precious metals, base metals, and energy-based derivatives.

**National Commodity Derivative Exchange(NCDEX):**

- It was introduced in 2003.
    - Although earlier it was controlled by the Forward Market Commission, after Jignesh Seth Case(2013), it was brought under SEBI.
    - NCDEX has its own sensitive index called Agridex which consists of 10 crops each of Kharif and Rabi.

**Indian Energy Exchange** for energy which is as of now regulated by the Central Electricity Regulation Commission.(and not SEBI)

**Derivatives**

- They are identified under securities contracts (regulation) act of 1956
    - Derivatives are financial contracts whose value derives from the performance of an underlying asset, group of assets, or benchmark.
    - Derivatives refer to any legal contract which derives its monetary value from an underlying asset.
    - For example, if Mr. A is having 1 quintal of potatoes in cold storage can make a document of it to be purchased and sold, it will be a derivative.
    - Derivatives could be tradeable or non-tradeable.

They are of four types:

**Forward derivatives:**

- In such kinds of derivatives, one party makes an agreement with the other, and the contract document works as a derivative.
        - For example - Businessman A made a contract with farmer B that he will purchase the crop at a given rate, at the given volume, at a given point of time.
        - As the forward derivatives are not tradable and not legally binding, it has counterparty risks (If the other party denies the contract).
        - This is why they were made legal and tradable to be called future derivatives.
    - What are contracts?
        - Spot contract - provide real delivery of assets, executed on same day or on future date
        - Ready delivery contract - executed immediately
        - Forward contracts - execute the contract on a specified date in future.

**Future Derivatives:**

- They are tradeable and legally binding and are utilized across a wide range of commodities - agriculture, non-agriculture, or even currencies.
    - Any dispute in such derivatives is resolved in the framework of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

**Options derivatives:**

- As the name indicates, in such derivatives, one party has the option to withdraw from the deal on the basis of point of reference - whether it is the buyer’s option or the seller’s option.
    - Options are a specific type of derivative contract that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before a specific expiration date.
    - It could be of two types.
        - **Call options:**
            - In such derivatives, the buyer makes an agreement with the seller about the future purchases at a given time, at a given rate.
            - And when that time arises, it's upon the buyer whether he wants to buy or not, but it is obligatory on the seller’s end to sell.
            - If the buyer is not buying, the advance given will be confiscated.
            - Booking a confirmed train ticket is an example of the Call option.
        - **Put option:** 
            - The seller has the choice of whether to sell or not, but it is obligatory for the buyer to buy.
            - If the seller is not selling, he has to return the advance taken, sometimes with interest.
            - Putting a household item for sale online is an example of the Put option.

**Swap derivatives:**

- It is where two parties can exchange certain assets between them.
    - For example - Mr. A trades at a fixed rate and if Mr. B trades at a floating rate if they feel like they can make a derivative to swap it.

**SEBI**

- In order to control the Bombay Stock Exchange as early as 1947, a Controller of Capital was issued which used to regulate both debt and equity market.
    - Subsequently, as the quantum of the capital market increased an independent body was felt needed.
    - Following that, in 1998, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been introduced.
    - Initially, SEBI was not enjoying that much regulating authority, but after Harshad Mehta Scam, it was empowered to be a statutory body with quasi-legislative, quasi executive, and quasi judiciary functions.
    - In terms of the legislative function, it makes rules for companies that are listed or are likely to be listed, for investors, depository participants, brokers, and other institutions like exchanges.
    - In terms of executive function, it controls and regulates in terms of day-to-day functioning, and in terms of judicial functions, it is the first layer of dispute resolution.
    - Additionally, SEBI is also a member of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) introduced in 2010 which is headed by the finance minister. SEBI provides necessary inputs regarding financial stability. The RBI Governor is also its member

**Some landmark achievements of SEBI:**

- Insider trading has been banned by SEBI.
        - Insider trading refers to the illegal practice of using non-public, material information about a publicly traded company to profit in the stock market.
    - Contango has been discontinued. Under it, one party could get extra days for payments.
    - T + 1 settlement has been introduced.
    - SEBI also ensures that they play important role in terms of funding the climate action.
    - For this purpose, SEBI had made a rule that the top 1000 listed companies will provide disclosure regarding physical, environmental, social, and governance(ESG) disclosure as a part of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report.
    - Whatsoever, the risks will be mitigated by providing the finances by these companies. It will be mandatory by 2023 and as of now, it is voluntary.

## Miscellaneous

- **Viability Gap Funding (VGF) is** designed to provide capital support to PPP projects which would not otherwise be financially viable**.**

## International economics

- Refers to those dimensions of economic activities where more than one country's economic boundaries are involved
    - Globally with the industrial revolution when the trade increased resulted in the pursuit of new markets and subsequently colonization and imperialism
    - By the beginning of the 20th century, there were largely two economic powers the UK and USA
    - However, WWII and great depression resulted in thrashing the world economy
    - In UK **Keynes** was trying to figure out what could be the way forward and in the USA its counterpart was **Dexter white**
    - In 1944 they came together at the Bretton woods conference along with other representatives (from India CD Deshmukh) popularly called as Bretton woods conference which resulted in the following 3 major outcomes -
        - It was realized that many low-income countries are in a vicious trap
            - As a solution to this problem, it was advised that there should be an **international bank for reconstruction and development** to provide concessional loans to these countries
            - Later on, called as World bank along with IDA
        - To provide standardization in terms of calculation and national accounting along with guidelines for balance of payments
            - For this purpose, **IMF** was made which also provides loans only in the BOP crisis
        - Most significant point of reference was to develop a **general consensus on trade laws**
            - The committee was of opinion that there should be an institution for it to be named as ITO but it could not be realized
            - However general agreement on trade on the tariff(GATT) was introduced

### Balance of Payment(BoP)

- Refers to a country's balance sheet that is import and export of a country with rest of the world
    - **Guidelines** of maintaining BoP are drawn by **IMF** and currently, its 6th series is applicable since 2008 (BoP manual)
    - In India BoP details are maintained by RBI and calculations are done in dollars

- As per the BoP manuals, BoP is divided into the following two heads -
        - **Current account -**
            - Balance of Trade
            - Balance of Invisibles
                - Services
                - Transfers (Profit, Interests)
                - Remittances

![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 32.png>)

- **Capital Account -**
        - Investment
        - Debt
        - Banking capital

![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 33.png>)

- The general trend of BoP has been negative for India which means there is a trade deficit
    - However, there is an exception for 2020 for a given quarter it was found positive happened due to lockdown as economic activity was low.
    - India has maximum **exports** in petroleum products (roughly 15%  of total exports)
    - Sometimes additional demand also emerged in order to fill **strategic petroleum reservoirs(SPR)**
        - SPR refers to that reservoir of crude oil that the country mix as a buffer for unforeseen situations like war, sudden rise in crude oil price, etc.
        - In India, it was introduced in 1998
        - Under the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, there is a company called **Indian strategic petroleum reservoir limited** which maintains it
        - As of now, we have at Padur, Mangalore, Vishakhapatnam, Chandikhole, and Bikaner currently capacity of 550 metric tonnes to fulfil 9 days requirements

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 8.jpeg>)

- Similarly, in terms of gold, our local demand is high and gold is used as raw material in gems and jewellery.
    - Coal combustion is another concern of import of coal

**World oil reserves**

![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 34.png>)

**Current Scenario**

- Currently as per the Economic survey 2021-22 Balance of Trade in India is in Deficit but in a controlled fashion. 
    - The reasons for the Deficit are -
        - Too much dependence on Crude oil (For consumption and as Raw material for Petroleum products and Demand for strategic reserves) 
        - Import of Gold is Higher
        - To overcome this dependence India is trying to Gradually switch over to Renewable energy Resources along with initiatives like **Inflation Index bonds, Sovereign Gold Bonds, etc.** to reduce the demand for Gold.

- The top 5 **imported** items are :-
        - Crude petroleum
            - approximately 20% of India's total imports
        - Gold
        - Petroleum products - e.g. petroleum gas (LPG)
        - Precious, Semiprecious Stones
        - Coal, Coke, and Briquettes

- In terms of exports **Top 5 exports** in India is having
        - Refined Petroleum products
        - Gems and Jewellery
        - Iron and Steel
        - Pharma
        - Gold based Jewelleries
        - Rice

- As of 2025, India's top five imports and exports reflect its economic structure and trade dynamics. Here’s a detailed overview:

**Top Five Imports of India**

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 9.jpeg>)

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 35.png>)
    - In order to Increase export potential India is continuously striving towards - having mass scale production to make it cost-effective with quality (That's why the slogan of **Zero effect Zero Defect** has been given) which means no detrimental effect on the environment and no compromise on quality.
    - India is continuously working towards export facilitation by offering all necessary capital availability. This is made sure by bringing export credit into the  Priority Sector Lending (**PSL**) quota, **ECGC** (export credit guarantee corporation) takes credit guarantee so that the bank can provide loans to the exporters without hesitation.
    - Recently, 750 crore capital has been infused in **EXIM bank** to promote export.

- The Export can be strengthened with **more Trade agreements.**

- **Trade agreements:**
        - In India 2021-22 an ambitious target of **400 billion exports** was set which has been achieved but Still one of the major concerns is that **maximum export is (almost 40%) confined only to 7 countrie**s which focuses on immediate needs of **trade diversification** that means more country should be the trade partners.
        - On a positive note last year we have found Belgium as a new entrant in the Top 10. India is continuously striving to foster trade agreements with other countries.

- **Some of the common trade agreements are -**
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 36.png>)

- **Early harvest schemes** - In this category one country tries its straight partnership with other countries on a pilot basis. 
    - **PTA (Preferential trade agreements)** - In these two countries or multi-trade partners provide concessional tariffs on certain given items and for the rest of the items, it will be generalist. For example - Country A and Country B have PTA on 10 items which means in these 10 items there will be concessional tariffs while on other items it will be normal tariffs. 
    - **FTA (Free trade agreements) -** in this agreement countries develop a consensus that except for a few items on which there will be a normal tariff. The rest of the items will be having concessional tariffs.
    - **Comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA)** - This is one step better than FTA where countries are not only providing concessional tariffs but also protecting the business, copyright, and investment interests of the trading partners. In such agreements both the countries help each other to promote their trade in their respective territories.
    - **CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement)** - In this agreement services are also included so we can say that **CECA + Services = CEPA**
        - E.g. UAE, S. Korea, Japan
    - **Common Markets**- This is one step better than CEPA where national boundaries are becoming almost irrelevant for trade purposes items and services can move from one place to another with common currencies and connected logistics. For example EU.

- Moreover, In order to Promote export from 1st January 2021, Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (**RoDTEP)** Scheme is brought into effect. **It is a replacement for the Merchandise Exports from India scheme**. Under this, following the WTO compliance, various taxes are returned to ensure that export taxes are not exported. 
    - Additionally, there is an approach of developing districts as export hubs and many of the sectors are under PLI.
    - Moreover, To promote an export **electronic platform** for the preferential certificate of origin has been developed to make it contactless. 
    - Similarly, there is an ongoing export promotion capital goods scheme, SEZ, Trade infrastructure for the export scheme, etc. to promote export. 

### BALANCE OF INVISIBLE

**In Terms of Services**

- In India Service sector is characterized by the following three categories -
        - **General services** consist of - Transport; Telecommunication; Hospitality and such services.
        - Financial, Real-Estate, and other **Professional services**.
        - Public Administration and **Defence**, etc.

- On the Other Hand in International trade, **as per WTO trade in services** are subdivided into the following four categories.
        - Mode 1 - Services across Borders like BPO
        - Mode 2 - Which is Consumption abroad. For ex- Tourism
        - Mode 3- **Commercial Presence -** Services provided by one country will have their commercial presence in the destination country. For example- banking, Hotel, etc.
        - **Mode 4 -** Where International labour Agreements are highlighted which allows the movement of labour from one country to another
    - Most developing countries want Mode 1 and Mode 4 to be promoted
    - Developed countries want Mode 2 and 3 to be promoted

- In services, India is in surplus primarily due to the Software and BPO sector. The Maximum export destination is the USA. 
    - However, COVID has resulted in a negative impact in terms of contact-intensive industry.
    - Moreover, Financial Services is Now viewed as a Potential Champion sector.
    - To promote them further, Safe Harbour Rules have been introduced.
    - The Safe Harbour rules provide certain relaxation in the tax by amending IT Act 1961 to attract those Indian Professionals who are operating from other countries like Singapore.
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 10.jpeg>)

- In terms of Remittances since 2008 India **Rank 1 in Inflow.** 

- The Current Account Position - To conclude it can be said that the overall Current Account is in Deficit (CAD). Balance of Trade is in Deficit while the Balance of Service is in Surplus. 

**Capital Account**

- ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 37.png>)
    - The Capital Account is further subdivided into investments, debt and banking capital.

**Foreign Investment**

- As per RBI, foreign investment refers to any kind of investment done by a **Non-Resident** which could be the repatriable or sometimes non-repatriable basis in any Indian company or LLP(Limited Liability Partnership).
    - Repatriability means that a foreign investor after a given period of time can take back his capital after adjusting and paying various taxes.
    - This foreign investment could be done in two ways:
        - **A. Via Automatic route**
            - In such kinds of investments, no prior approval from the government is needed. One can directly invest in the given company provided showing conformity to **Foreign Exchange Management Act(FEMA) Guidelines, 1999.**
                - (Earlier it was **Foreign Exchange Regulation Act(FERA**) which was more restrictive and apprehensive towards foreign investments. The rules were rigid and punishments were severe for violations creating a negative atmosphere in terms of investment. However, after the 1991 reforms, we started inviting foreign investments and to facilitate it further, in 1999, the Foreign Exchange Management Act(FEMA) was introduced with a positive outlook towards the promotion of foreign investments).
        - **B. Government route**
            - In the government route(also called the **Delhi route**), prior approval from the government is needed. It is given by respective departments and ministries.
            - Initially, around 2008-09, it was realised that there should be a **Foreign Investment Promotion Board(FIPB)** to promote foreign investments. But around 2017, it was realised that as most of the foreign investment(more than 90%) is now through an automatic route, FIPB should be scrapped and there should be one **Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal** for government approvals.
                - This foreign investment have the benchmark of 10%, 26%, 49%, 74% and 100%.
            - **Various types of capital instruments in foreign investment**

- **a. Equity shares -** that is by offering shares to foreign investors
    - **b. Debentures -** that is offering debt instruments to foreign investors
    - **c. Preferential shares** - it refers to those shares that comes with privileges over common shares in certain aspects like payments liquidation. Unlike common shares they do not carry voting rights.
    - **d. Share warrants -** it refers to the documents/legal documents raised against the shares given to foreign investors.
    - **e. Convertible notes -** it refers to the instrument of investment of start-ups where initially it is in form of debt but has the option to get converted into shares.
        - Primary advantage is share valuation is not required (i.e. this can be issued without the requirement of valuation report)
        - They are regulated by **RBI**.
    - **f. Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds(FCCB)-** type of debt instrument that combines features of both bonds and equity. where a bond in foreign currency is issued and given to the foreign investor with the options of convertibility of debt into shares. The advantage of issuing an FCCB is that the investor will be immune from exchange rate fluctuation. For example: If Mr A purchases a bond of an Indian Company in rupees, the risks of exchange differences will be on him. On the contrary, if it is issued in the foreign currency exchange rate, risks will be to the company itself.
    - **g. Depository receipts**
        - Depository receipts (DRs) are unique financial instruments that allow investors to indirectly hold shares in companies listed on foreign stock exchanges. They act as certificates representing a specific number of shares in the underlying foreign company, held by a custodian bank in the investor's home country. This enables easier access to international markets without the complexities of directly trading foreign stocks.
        - It refers to that fundraising where a **bank is an intermediary**. For example, any XYZ Company of India approaches an American Bank that issues depository receipts bought by American investors.
        - **ADR - American Depositary Receipts**, refers to all those depository receipts issued by an American Bank which is purchased by their investors and thus provide foreign investment to that Company.
        - **GDR- Global Depository Receipts**- refers to depository receipts issued by any European Bank
        - **BHDR- Bharat Depository Receipts**- in India around 2011, Standard Chartered Bank introduced IDR(Indian Depository Receipt) which means any given company in a foreign country can raise funds from India with the help of this bank. However, it did not perform well, so on the recommendation of the MS Sahu panel certain improvisation were made and it was reintroduced as BHDR.

**Foreign Direct Investment(FDI)**

- It refers to **any foreign investment having 10% or above stockholding** while Foreign Portfolio Investment(FPI) is when it is less than 10%.
    - RBI very explicitly highlights that there are no other criteria to determine FDI or FPI other than the percentage. However, once FDI is always FDI.
    - For any country, an increase in FDI symbolises the trust of investors in that country and its fundamentals of the economy in terms of policy interventions, demand, etc.
    - On the other hand, if FPI is more, it signifies that the country is viewed as a short term destination. And if the proportion of FPI is more than FDI, then such economies are called **hot economies** leaving them vulnerable to inflation shocks. (if in any economy, there is a sudden outflow of main currencies like dollar, yen, euro, etc, the currency starts depreciating resulting in a heated currency so it can be said that FPI is good only if it is supported by a huge quantum of FDI)

**Promoting FDI**

- India is continuously working on the promotion of FDI by making most of it via automatic route.
    - During Covid, sensing the opportunity for greater foreign participation, foreign investments are encouraged in the defence sector where it is 74% automatic and 100% under the government route; insurance sector where it has been increased to 74% under the automatic route; in petroleum and natural gas it is 100% under automatic route and Telecom sector it is 100% automatic route.
    - To promote FDI, there is a dedicated **FDI Monitoring Cell** consisting of an inter-ministerial committee under DPIIT to facilitate whatsoever could be their requirement in terms of foreign investors.
    - Although, India is promoting FDI but not on the terms and conditions of others. Even necessary steps have been taken to curb any opportunistic takeover.

**Foreign Portfolio Investment(FPI)**

- As per RBI, FPI inflow has been subjected to vulnerability due to external factors.
    - **In general, this FPI is viewed under the following heads:**
        - **1. Foreign Institutional Investment(FII)**- It refers to that investment that is done with the help of an authorised investment vehicle (an investment vehicle is an institution allowed to invest as per the guidelines mentioned and it is registered with SEBI or other regulatory agency). This FII can be further subdivided in:
            - **a. FII through Participatory Notes(P-notes):** In such investment, the Foreign Portfolio investor does not disclose his identity. On the contrary, it entitles to given investment vehicle to invest on his behalf. This is one of those options which any government takes as a last resort.
            - **b. FII through Voluntary Retention Route(VRR)-** In this, if any investor is investing in India for a definite period of time (at least 3 years) then special clearances are provided. In the Covid times, its volume has been doubled.
        - **2. Qualified Foreign Investment**
            - It was introduced in 2011 that if any foreign investor is coming from a country who is a member of the **Financial Action Task Force(FATF)** or the **International Organisation of Security Commission(IOSC)** get quick clearances of investment.

- **Taper Tantrum:**
        - It refers to that tapering that was introduced around 2012-13 in the USA to control their inflation. As the USA has witnessed the 2008 sub-prime crisis, 2009 huge bailout package by the govt. As money inflow increased it resulted in higher inflation and to absorb that inflation the USA federal reserve issued bonds with higher coupon rates.
        - As a consequence of it, investors were attracted which resulted back home in India in the outflow of FPI. We have witnessed the same tendency in the current financial year (2021-22) is the reason why tapering is witnessed in the USA again, however, back home now our dependence on FPI is way lesser so that outflow is not going to upset the growth trajectory, however, it may adversely impact the exchange value of the currency.

- **FPI in Govt Securities:**
        - In govt securities, FPI is allowed and for that RBI notifies accordingly moreover the FPI in govt security is also promoted in the voluntary retention route (VRR) with a locking period of 3 years.
        - In the 2020 Budget to promote FPIs in govt securities two more options have been introduced

- **1. Fully accessible Route (FAR) =** under this in the given specified securities which are notified by RBI, foreign investments are invited without any restriction which means they can buy as much as they want. However, as of now, it is only applicable on central govt dated securities.
    - **2. Medium Term Framework (MTF)** = in this foreign investments are attracted but the given restriction and that too for a given period of time. In this, they can buy both central govt securities and state developmental loans (SDLs).

**Debt**

- In the capital account of BoP yet another head is Debt, which can be largely sub-divided into **sovereign debt and external commercial borrowing (ECB)**
    - Based on data from Department of Economic Affairs (DEA)
        - Total external debt: US$ 554.8 billion
        - Sovereign (general government) external debt: US$ 116.5 billion
        - Percentage of sovereign debt in total external debt: 21.0%

- Sovereign debt refers to the loan taken by the govt from various financial institutions like World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), etc.
    - In the case of **India, the sovereign debt on govt from the** **external sector hovers below 10% of the total public debt** which provides it a very comfortable situation.
    - On the other hand, **ECB** refers to that situation where a company in India public or private takes a loan from the outside. It could be done with the help of -
        - a) Foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) and
        - b) Masala Bonds (refer to those bonds which are issued in rupees and purchased by foreign investors because it is supported by IFC (International Finance Corporation, one member of the World Bank Group) which increases its reliability and safety of investment (IFC work as a platform for various countries to raise funds for that any company of a given country can approach IFC and after a thorough examination, they take guarantee of the bond of that company making it AAA and the name of the bond are given on the given characteristics of India, for India it is called as Masala Bond, for China = Dim-Sum bond, Japan =Samurai Bond, and so on.)
            - Recently **NTPC has raised funds called Green Masala Bond**.

**Banking Capital**

- In terms of banking Capital, it refers to the capital at the disposal of the bank (Net value) in form of various assets and Foreign Currency non-resident accounts (FCNRA), this FCNR is divided into the following two -

- **FCNR(A) =** was introduced in 1975 but discontinued in 1993 because in this the exchange change risk burden of foreign currency was with RBI. So if RBI promotes FCNR accounts in the same proportion exchange burden also increases. however, since 1993 We have **FCNR(B)** in which the exchange risk is with the banks. 
        - In this FCNR(B) Scheme since 2005 the acceptable currencies are = US$, Pound Sterling, Euro, Japanese Yen, along with Australian and Canadian Dollar
        - With the help of this capital having the option of currency swaps provide a safe domain.
        - The overall Capital account balance is in surplus which makes overall the BoP in surplus.
    - **NRO Account (non resident ordinary) -** Saving account converted to NRO when the resident become non resident indian
        - Rupee denominated
        - There is limit on repatriation set by RBI
        - Interest earned is 30% taxable
    - **NRE Account (non resident external) -** rupee denominated account for NRI
        - There is no limit on repatriation into foreign currency
        - interest is not taxable
        - Issue is it is in rupee - subject to exchange rate fluctuation.

### Exchange rate

- In simple words Exchange rate refers to the value of one currency viz-a-vis other, which means in order to get one unit of another currency how many units of native currency are needed.
    - It is very important to mention here that the exchange rate of currencies is the product of demand and availability and must not be confused with the strengths and weaknesses of the economy.
    - This exchange rate is often viewed in the **following two dimensions** -
        - a) in terms of the dollar (dollar-denominated), and
        - b) in terms of the effective value of exchange with the currencies of major trading partners

- **In terms of Dollars:**
        - In the 1930s dollar was considered one of the most trusted currencies as one dollar was pegged with 0.88-gram gold, which means, what will be the value of 0.88 gram of gold against which one dollar will be printed.
        - This led to dollar hegemony in the world economy which further intensified with the BoP guideline of calculations in Dollar.
        - However, this hegemony was reduced to some extent in 1968 when the dollar was de-pegged with Gold, even in the current scenario several attempts have been made towards de-dollarization.
        - It was Triffin who highlighted that this pegging is no doubt providing more acceptance of the dollar but on the other hand more demand for the dollar which results in more demand for gold and thus increasing gold price, this explanation is popularly called as **Triffin dilemma**.

- **The exchange rate could be of the following 4 types -**
        - **1. Fixed Exchange Rate =** where how much will be the value of one dollar vis-a-vis native currency is determined by the govt/central bank. If they themself reduce or increase the exchange value is called devaluation or revaluation respectively
            - **Thumb Rule of Exchange Rate:** if the currency depreciates/devaluates it support exports and therefore those countries who are prioritizing export will devaluate the currency so it can be said that currency appreciation is good when the country is importing more and exporting less, while currency depreciation is good when the country is exporting more or want to export more because it will make their product cheaper at the global level.
        - **2. Floating Exchange Rate =** refers to that situation where exchange rates are market-driven on the basis of demand and supply. If the native currency, the value gets weaker is called depreciation, and if it the stronger is called appreciation.

- **3. Managed or Dirty Floating Exchange Rate =** it is wherein a given bandwidth the currencies are allowed to have a floating exchange rate but the moment it is going beyond the threshold central bank intervenes to regulate it. India follows this model. for example, If RBI provides bandwidth of 60-80 that means 1 dollar is between 60 Rs to 80 Rs its fluctuations will be determined by the market but the moment it is going below 80 Rs or above 60 Rs RBI will intervene.

- **4. Manipulative Exchange Rate =** it refers to those countries who deliberately manipulate their exchange rate with the dollar to support export. The USA maintains a list of these manipulators like China, Hong Kong, etc. along with another list of manipulation watchlists regarding potential manipulators.

- **Effective exchange rate (EER)**
        - The exchange rate of the rupee can gaze with major trading partners because at the end of the day effective fluctuation in the exchange value of those currencies with whom India is trading is significant.
        - We calculate this in the following two baskets: the effective exchange rate of the rupee vs 6 currencies with whom India has maximum trade is called **EER 6.**
            - It is geometric mean.
        - 2nd Exchange rate : Effective exchange rates of rupee vis currencies of 40 major trading partners.
            - Till recently, there were 36 major currencies but in 2021, the RBI has updated it to 40 currencies by adding 8 currencies and deleting 4 currencies.
        - Both the effective exchange rates are viewed at the **nominal price** i.e. the current price as well as the real values as well as the constant price.
        - Earlier the base year was 2004-05 but now has been changed to 2015-16.
        - The NEER measures the average value of a country's currency against a basket of currencies of its major trading partners, weighted by their trade importance.
        - The REER takes the NEER a step further by adjusting it for inflation differences between the home country and its trading partners.
        - A nation's nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), adjusted for inflation in the home country, equals its real effective exchange rate (REER).
            - REER = NEER/Price deflator
            - If REER is greater then 100 then currency is **overvalued**
            - To keep exports competitive RBI generally keep the REER < 100.

- **Market sterilization**
        - Market sterilization refers to the attempt of RBI the help of which RBI tries to regulate the exchange rate when it is going beyond the notified bandwidth.
        - For this, there is a foreign desk at RBI which sell dollar if the rupee is depreciating to commercial and this will make availability of dollar in the system.
        - On the other hand, if the rupee is appreciating, the RBI purchases dollars from the bank and keeps it aside to have additional demands and thus rupee starts depreciating.
    - **Reasons for Rupee Depreciation:**
        - Strength of the US Dollar
        - Current Account Deficit (CAD)
        - Crude Oil Prices
        - Inflation Differentials
        - Global Trade Tensions
        - Global Risk Aversion
            - Economic uncertainty or geopolitical tensions, can lead to capital outflows from emerging markets like India, exerting downward pressure on the rupee.

- **Currency convertible**
        - It means exchanging one currency for another.
        - As of now, the current account is convertible in India.
        - Currency convertibility refers to that situation where one currency can be converted into another currency without the intervention of the central bank which means no prior approval from the central bank will be needed.
        - In India, after the 1991 reforms when the exchange rate was made market-oriented, it was natural to think of currency convertibility.
        - In this regard, the famous Tarapore committee, 2012 has highlighted that currency convertibility symbolizes the openness of the economy. India also should strive for making both current and capital accounts convertible in a phased manner.

- In terms of the current account, there are no such challenges but in terms of capital account he talks to be more cautious, because it may result in various complications of legal nature particularly in terms of ownership (he advocated that capital account should be convertible by 2012).
    - Recently the RBI governor has highlighted again that although our current account is convertible completely, the capital account convertibility must be viewed as a process and not an incident as India's legal framework is improving as more and more relaxations.

## Institutions

## World Bank

- Mission: To reduce poverty and promote sustainable development
    - Focus: Long-term development objectives like infrastructure projects, education, healthcare, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability.
    - Target: Primarily low- and middle-income countries facing development challenges.

- World Bank- in 1944, at Bretton Woods, it was highlighted that if poor economies are not supported with capital from outside they may collapse which will be adverse to the global economic prospects that is why it was highlighted that there should be one organization to provide loans on the concessional basis to these poor economies or developing economies.
        - As a result, IBRD which is International Bank for Reconstruction and Development emerged.
        - Later on, called as Development Bank and other three agencies + IDA made it World Bank group.
        - The World Bank means IBRD + IDA while the world bank group means World Bank+ 3 other agencies.
    - A brief introduction of each of them is as follows:
        - It consists of 2 organizations IBRD and IDA.
        - Timeline
            - IBRD- 1944-45
            - IDA- 1960-61
            - IFC- 1956
            - MIGA- 1988
            - ICSID- 1966
    - Finance is provided by IBRD- but it is giving loans only to those countries which have repaying capacity.
    - There are around 75 countries that are poor. IDA provides loans to these countries. Such loans are given for 30-38 years with an additional grace year period.
    - Andorra has joined IMF (in 2020 as the 190th member). Soon, it will join the world bank also.
    - India is not a member of ICSID. It is a dispute resolution mechanism.

**International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)**

- It was introduced in 1944-45 and currently has 189 members.
    - They can raise funds with the help of various securities.
    - Provide financial products to middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries.
    - Loans come with market-based interest rates and standard repayment terms.
    - This IBRD provides concessional loans to those countries who are having repayment capabilities.
    - They provide loans for various development projects like health, education, women empowerment, sanitation, safe drinking water, etc.

**IDA - International Development Association**

- It was highlighted that there are 75 countries across the globe that do not save and do not have repayment capability.
    - There must be some arrangements for them. For this purpose, IDA was introduced.
    - It offers interest-free loans and grants to the world's poorest countries, facing challenging development constraints.
    - Highly concessional terms with long maturities and grace periods.
    - This organization provides loans to these 75 countries for a longer period of 30-38 years with grace periods.

**IFC- international finance cooperation**

- This organization works as a platform and facilitated so that various public and private companies of member countries can raise funds in the international market by issuing bonds in their home currencies. E.g. - It is IFC that facilitates Masala Bonds for India.
        - It was introduced in 1956 and has 184 members.

**MIGA- Multi-lateral Investment Guarantee Agency**

- This institution was introduced in 1998 and it takes guarantees investments in various conflict zones and in this way indirectly assists countries to get investors.

**ICSID- International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes**

- This organization is currently having 154 members and they work as a mediator for various dispute resolutions. India is not a member of it.

**International Comparison Program of World Bank**  

- The World Bank provides comparative data on per capita income in terms of GDP-PPP by using an SDR deflator. On this basis, it divides countries into the following 4 categories
        - Low-income countries have per capita income of up to 1036 USD (PPP)
        - Lower middle-income countries from 1036 to 4045.
        - Higher middle income from 4046 to 12535 USD.
        - High-income countries: above 12535

- World Bank also provides the famous international debt statistics along with an ease of doing business index.
        - This ease of doing business index is an index of 10 indicators that differ in how easy or difficult is doing business in a given country from registration to getting facilities like electricity, finances, insolvency processes, etc.
            - As of now, this index is being discontinued because of the discrepancy in 2018-19 data, particularly in respect of China, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Azerbaijan.

## International Monetary Fund

- Mission: To promote global financial stability and economic cooperation
    - Focus: Short-term macroeconomic stability and crisis management through loans
    - Target: All member countries, with a focus on those facing balance of payments problems, high debt, or financial crises.

- It came into existence in 1944 along with IBRD which is why they together are called twin organizations.
    - While IBRD is for developmental loans, IMF provides loans only in the BOP crisis.
    - The key function which IMF performs is developing the standard calculation methodology in economics, to take care of global financial stability (for the purpose they issue the Global Financial Stability Report), along with preparing BOP manual and low resistance for BOP crisis. It also publishes World Economic Outlook.
    - The IMF has 190 members. The latest entrant is Andorra.

- **The fund and the quota:**
        - In IMF, every country makes a contribution to make a fund which they can utilise as part of a loan in the BOP Crisis. On one hand And, on the other hand, every country makes a contribution to a general pool to help other countries in their BOP Crisis in order to have a stable global economy 
        - Whatever proportion of the fund will be contributed by a country is called the Quota of that country 
        - This Quota is decided on the basis of the following 4 parameters:
            - 1. GDP of the economy with 50% of weightage (60% market exchange rate, 40% PPP)
            - 2.  Openness of the economy with 30% weightage
            - 3. Economic viability with 15% weightage  
            - 4. Forex with 5% weightage 
            - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 38.png>)
        - The quota of a country will be deciding factor in the voting rights of that country 
            - For example, as India's Quota is 2.7% of the fund, her voting right is roughly 2.6%
            - India's position is 8th, the maximum quota in IMF is of USA, almost 17%; therefore voting rights are almost equal to it. 
            - This provides an advantageous position in the USA because, at IMF, no decision can be taken without 85% of support
                - Practically de facto veto power
                - I.e. why countries are demanding an IMF reform by revising the quota so that no single country has a dominance) 
        - This can be done either by changing the formula of Quota allocation or reducing the consensus % below the existing 85%

**How the Quota is deposited**:

- Whatever the quota of a country is deposited in the following breakups:
        - 1. 25% of the Quota has to be deposited in form of Gold and therefore is called a Gold tranche
            - This was the provision till 1978, after that instead of gold, the dollar can also be deposited 
        - 2. Rest of the 75% will be deposited in form of native currencies plus foreign currencies as directed by IMF 
            - This 100% together is called Safe Tranche
    - Any country can take an unconditional loan from IMF, equal to their Gold Tranche without any interest rate and equal to a safe tranche with some interest rates
    - However, yet another 100% (equal to Quota), also can be taken as a loan called a Credit Tranche
        - Beyond this Credit Tranche, the country is taking loans than will be with the condition of reforms; for example, India did it in 1991; Sri Lanka is trying now 
        - For example, if India's Quota is 100 $; then 25$ deposited in gold will be called Gold Tranche; the entire 100$ will be called safe tranche; 100$+100S will be called credit tranche 

**Reserve Tranche Position (RTP**)

- The RTP is SDR that a country is having to be used at their disposal without an interest rate 
        - For any given country, it is initially equal to the Gold Tranche but it may increase if:
            - 1. Country's Quota is revised 
            - 2. Country is giving affiliated loans to other countries 
                - I.e. why the Forex of the country consists of Gold, Foreign Currency and RTP

**Rapid Financing Instrument(RFI)**

- Provide rapid, low-access financial assistance to countries facing urgent balance of payments needs that, if not addressed, would result in an immediate and severe economic disruption.
    - **Rapid Credit Facility (RCF)** - provides fast concessional financial assistance to low-income countries (LICs) facing an urgent balance of payments need. The RCF is one of the facilities under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).

Non concessional lending by IMF

- Extended fund facility
    - Rapid financing instrument
    - Precautionary and liquidity line
    - Flexible credit line
    - Standby arrangement

Concessional lending by IMF

- The poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF) - interest free

**Special Drawing Rights (SDRs**)

- The SDR was created as a supplementary international reserve asset
    - The SDR is neither a currency nor a claim on the IMF.
    - The Special Drawing Right (SDR) is an interest-bearing international reserve asset
        - SDRi is the interest paid
    - The value of SDR is decided daily based on market exchange rates

- Upto 1968, as the US dollar was pegged with Gold, IMF used US Dollar as its currency 
    - But after de-pegging, IMF introduced its own currency called SDR in 1969 
        - Initially, it was having more than 18 currencies into it but after the interaction of the Euro, it was reduced to 4
        - They were, US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen and Euro 
            - However, in 2016, Chinese Renminbi also joined it 
        - The highest weightage in SDR is of US Dollar, followed by Euro, Renminbi, Yen and Sterling 
    - SDR is also called Paper Gold 
    - In IMF, different kinds of loans are available i.e.
        - 1. Affiliated loan - country provides loan on behalf of IMF
        - 2. Precautionary lending - When as a precautionary measure, a country is taking a loan
        - 3. Standby loans - When a country is of the opinion that a BOP Crisis may happen
        - 4. Extended Facility Loan - Where a country is provided with an extra loan on the guarantee of the other country

**IMF Reports:**

- IMF also comes up with some of its flagships publications regarding the global economy:
        - 1. World Economic Outlook - It comes in two volumes
        - 2. Global Financial Stability Report

- IMF Facilities

## World Trade Organization (WTO)

- WTO is one of the most important institutions to foster international trade 
    - Since, the 1950s, when the concept of "Global Village" was popularised, it was well thought that the Global economy or the world trade can foster only when distortion-free international trade is allowed 
    - That means various tangibles and intangibles barriers to trade are withering away or disappearing 
    - In this regard, General agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT)was an important development that tried to address various trade barriers be tariff barriers; technical barriers; lack of trade facilitation; subsidy issues; trade-in services (1982 onwards); trade-related investment barriers, etc 
    - One of the biggest achievements was in **1964** when the **United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTD)** came into existence, this UNCTAD has, later on, introduced the concept of the **Generalised System of Preferences (GSP**), where a country provides overall Favourable Treatment by lowering Tariffs on imports from a particular country 
    - This way, a developed country started helping developing countries 
    - Later on in 1986 at Uruguay Round, once again an attempt was made to develop an international organisation to facilitate World Trade and subsequently, in 1994, the Marrakesh Agreement has opened resulting in the formation of WTO.

- WTO consists of a General Council for routine policy-making and administrative functions 
    - This consists of various representatives from the member countries and at the apex level, it holds Ministerial Conference where ministers from member countries meet once in two years, popularly called as Ministerial conference 
    - As of now, there are 164 members (Director General) of the WTO

- On the other hand, there is a Dispute Resolution Body to take the disputes 
        - However, it is important to mention that at WTO, disputes are resolved with the principles of negotiation 
        - Some of the ministerial conferences are - Singapore (1995); Doha - 2001; Bali - 2013 and Geneva - 2021 

**Achievements of WTO**

- General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
    - Agreement on Agriculture (AoA)
    - Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
    - General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS):
    - Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs):

- **In terms of Tariff**
        - At WTO, a consensus was made that there will be bound rates in terms of tariffs, which means the uppermost limit of duties one country can impose upon other 
        - Within these bound rates, countries can offer different tariffs to different countries depending upon their trade agreements 
        - However, there are some exceptions like anti-dumping duty and countervailing duty 

- **Anti-dumping duty:**
        - Anti-Dumping duties refers to the protectionist measures imposed by a country to foreign imports believed to be priced below the fair market value.
        - This clearly indicates that the country is getting hostile and therefore to protect the interest of local manufacturers importing country can apply additional duty called as Anti-Dumping duty

- **Countervailing duty:**
        - Action taken by the importing country, usually in the form of increased duties to offset subsidies given to producers or exporters in the exporting country they are also called is anti-subsidy duties.
        - In WTO, the term **binding coverage** is very significant  which refers to the compliance with the laws expressed by countries. 
        - Tariff binding - Commitment not to increase a rate of duty beyond an agreed level. Once a rate of duty is bound, it may not be raised without compensating the affected parties.

- **In terms of Agriculture**:
        - Green Box
        - Amber Box
        - Blue Box
        - Development Box (S&D Box)
        - ![Economics](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Economics 39.png>)

- Technical barriers to trade
    - SPS Agreement - sanitary and phytosanitary measures
        -  It concerns the application of food safety and animal and plant health regulations. 

**GATS Services**

- Mode 1 Service - Example BPO. In this serving abroad by staying in the domestic area. Offering services abroad.
    - Mode 2 service - Those services where service takers coming to the exporter country ex tourism (consumption abroad)
    - Mode 3- exporters countries’ institutions going abroad to give services. Also known as commercial presence. E.g. DB in India
    - Mode 4 - international labour Movement. Labour mobility (Movement of natural persons)

- The above modes were discussed in the DOHA round of WTO.
    - GENEVA 2021- binding coverage under service domestic regulations SDR and covers 67 countries having a share of  90 % of services.

- Due to dysfunctional appellate Tribunal because of non appointment of arbitrators by US. EU among other members you has created another mechanism under WTO [Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mpia.png) (MPIA). However, India is not a party to this.

### Intellectual Property Rights

**Trade-related to IPR (TRIPS)**

- **What is IPR?**
        - These are rights given to persons over the creation of their minds. They usually give the creator an exclusive right over the use of his/her creation for a certain period.
    - **Types of IPR**
        - **Patent -** Is granted for an invention that is a new product or process that meets conditions of novelty, non-obvious and industrial use.
            - Novelty means an inventive step that is it involves technical advancement as compared to existing knowledge.
            - Non obvious means invention is not obvious to common people.
            - Industrial use means that an invention is capable of being made or being used in industry.
    - **Copyright**
        - It is given to the creation of literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic work and producers of cinematographic films and sound recordings.
        - This right allows its creator the rights of reproduction, communication to the public, adaptation, and translation of work.

## Infrastructure

- Railways
    - Roadways
    - Ports

- Infrastructure has a multiplier effect and thus gives a boost to the economy.
    - It improves the quality of life.
    - Important sectors covered under infrastructure are- Energy, railways, roads, ports and Civil Aviation.

- **National Infrastructure Pipeline**
        - Explained with the help of a slide
        - **Funding structure:**
            - The total outlay for the scheme is Rs 111 lakh Crore.
            - As of now, it consists of more than 9000 projects across 34 sub-sectors out of the total cost, 39% from the centre; 40% from the state and 21% from the private sector 
            - Almost 24% of the total investments will go into the energy sector.

- **India Investment Grid** has been developed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to attract investments.
        - Additionally, Alternative Investment Fund(AIFs) and the reintroduction of DFIs will also ensure fund availability.
            - Registered under SEBI
    - **National Monetization Pipeline**
        - It aims to unlock value from brownfield infrastructure assets across various sectors by attracting private sector participation through various models like concessions, leases, and partnerships.
        - The framework for core asset monetisation under the NMP has three key imperatives:
        - The focus is on the **brownfield de-risked assets with stable revenue streams.**Brownfield assets are those assets which are already in existence and can be upgraded and modified. 
        - The monetisation happens through the **monetisation of rights and not ownership**. Hence, the primary owner of the assets under these structures continues to be the public authority
        - **Structured partnerships under transparent competitive bidding and defined contractual frameworks.** Partners will have to abide by strict key performance indicators and performance standards.
        - Objectives:
            - Mobilize private sector investments to fund infrastructure development.
            - Enhance infrastructure efficiency of existing infrastructure assets.
            - Unlock asset value and reinvest it in new infrastructure projects.
        - Monetization Models:
            - Concessions: Private entities operate and maintain assets for a specified period and collect user charges.
            - Leases: Long-term leases give private operators control over assets for operational and revenue generation.
            - Sale of assets: Certain underutilized assets might be sold outright to private players.
            - Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs): Funds hold and invest in infrastructure assets, offering investors regular returns.

### Energy sector

- As of now, India is the third-largest producer and consumer of energy in the world. As a promising economy, India is bound to have higher energy demands in future.
    - In India, the problem of the energy sector can be identified under the two various heads 
        - **Technical challenges** 
            - **In India, the maximum energy is generated by the thermal plant.**
            - **Major problems involve the import of coal, particularly anthracite.**
            - **Lack of technological advancements (due to Coal India monopoly) so no deep mining.**
            - **The problem of captive power plants - It refers to the private power plants of big industries to ensure uninterrupted power supply; For that, they book the coal mining in advance** 
            - **Payload factor - It refers to the power generation capacity of the plant and if any plant is not using its potential the generation results in underutilisation.** 
            - **Lack of promotion of schemes like rooftop solar plants, etc** 

**Challenges plaguing the energy sector**

- Heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels: India imports around 80% of its oil and 50% of its gas
    - Financial Health of Distribution Companies (DISCOMs):
        - High aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C): Inefficient distribution systems and energy theft lead to significant revenue losses for DISCOMs.
        - Accumulated debt: Most DISCOMs are burdened with high debt, hindering their ability to invest in network upgrades and improve efficiency.
        - Cross-subsidies: Subsidies for certain consumer segments create distortions and financial stress for DISCOMs.
    - Transmission infrastructure: Grid infrastructure needs to be modernized to efficiently integrate and transmit renewable energy from diverse locations.
    - Land acquisition and environmental concerns: Siting and permitting of renewable energy projects can be challenging due to land acquisition hurdles and environmental concerns.

**Transmission/Mid-streaming**

- The major issue is transmission loss which is as high as **34%.**
    - This transmission loss is primarily because Power Grid Corporation of India is not up to the mark for technological up -gradation to off-grid storage of the surplus energy

**Distribution/Downstreaming**

- In terms of distribution, the biggest challenge is with Distribution companies i.e. DISCOMS
    - The problem of DISCOMS is high debts and its interest 
    - Moreover, electricity theft and lack of separate feeders for subsidised and commercial energy and
    - Also, massive corruption at the state level is a major challenge for the inefficiency of these discoms

**Some of the major initiatives taken to fix technological problems are:**

- **Ujjwal Discoms Assurance Yojana (UDAY)**- In this, the distribution companies are provided, financial assistance to ensure that they meet their Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. 
    - **PM KUSUM (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan) -** This is to empower farmers with a focus on renewable energy with three clear cut objectives:
        - To develop solar plants on the barren land and the generated energy can be transferred to the grid 
        - To distribute off-grid water pumps connected with solar plants for sustained irrigation and additional energy can be transferred to the Grid 
        - To provide a solar Grid plus electricity-based water pumps 
    - **Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDU-GJY)** - A separate feeder for subsidised energy distribution 
    - Under **SAUBHAGYA** and rooftop solar plants  ensuring electricity for all i.e. SDG 7
    - In **Atmanirbhar Bharat,** 90 thousand crores has been provided to Discoms to reduce their NPAs/Bad loans

**Other Initiatives:**

- **National Hydrogen Mission** 
        - Aim : to reduce 12 lakh crore energy import annually
        - As an alternative to fossil fuels, India is working on developing Green Hydrogen.
    - **Administrative Reforms**
        - Kelkar committee and NITI Aayog have highlighted that the Energy sector ministries like the Ministry of Power, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Ministry of Coal, Department of Nuclear Energy, etc must be **clubbed under one ministry** 
        - NITI Aayog has proposed that there should be **one ministry having separate agencies** within it one for research, one as a regulator, one for technical matters, one for distribution and one for subsidised PDS, along with one for policymaking.

**Railways, Ports, Road Transport and Civil Aviation**

- Railway has been the backbone of the economy in the British time.
    - In terms of railways, India is having more than 68,000 km of railway track administered by the Ministry of Railway.

- **The major challenges of the Indian railway today can be summed up as follows:**
        - Not up to the mark technological degradation
        - Limited track development since British time
        - Considering freight secondary over passengers
        - The issue of cross-subsidisation i.e. the losses occurred in railway passenger trains were compensated with freight

- **Bibek Debroy Committee recommended Railway reforms:**
        - Commercial operating and minimising subsidies.
        - To focus on freight corridors.
        - Non-core sectors should be outsourced.
        - There should be an independent regulator.
        - Investment in modernisation, etc.
        - To promote freight, **Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs**) are being developed such as **Eastern i.e. From Sahnewal to Dankuni; Western between Dadri/Greater Noida to Jawahar Lal Nehru Port; East from Kharagpur to Vijayawada; West From Mumbai to Kolkata; Western Ghats from Goa to Chennai and between Delhi and Chennai i.e. South.**
        - For enhancing safety in the Railway **KAVACH system** has been introduced which is indigenous RFID to sense and apply emergency breaks.
        - Additionally, there are **Kisan rails and special parcel trains** which started from **Guntur to Benapole in Bangladesh, etc**
        - There is a **NEW RAIL PLAN 2030** with the objectives of doubling logistics (making it more than 40%) by 2030 and getting complete electrification by 2023.

**Ports**

- India is having more than 7500 Km of coastal line.
    - There are 12 major ports and 200 minor ports - major ports are governed by Central Government.
    - In India, the biggest challenge in terms of ports is the turnaround time which is almost 3 times higher than the developed ports.
    - Additionally, the post is getting older and is aged with not much technological development.
    - Moreover, as exports are increasing, the burden on these ports is going to increase.
    - To develop infrastructure for ports following **two major initiatives** are significant:
        - **1. Sagarmala Project** - It focuses on port modernisation, connectivity enhancement through **Coastal Economic Zone (CEZ),** Port linked industrialisation and community Development Programmes in Coastal Areas  
        - **2. Port Authorities Act, 2020 -** This act replaced the **Port Trust Act of 1963** and is characterised by more autonomy to the board in matters of finance and funding, charges, fine, and adjudication in their jurisdiction.

**Road Transport**

- India has a road network (National and State Highways, District, Rural, Urban and Project Roads) of over 63.71 lakh km of roads as of March 2019, the second-largest in the world, after the United States.
    - **Recent developments:**
        - Increase in the pace of road construction in 2020-21 to 36.5 km per day from 28 km per day in 2019- 20 (a rise of 30.4 per cent).
        - Increase in public expenditure by 29.5 per cent in 2020-21 compared to the previous year.

**Civil Aviation:**

- India is one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world.
    - **Domestic traffic more than doubled** from around 61 million in 2013-14 to around 137 million in 2019-20, registering a **growth of over 14 per cent per annum.** 
    - **Initiatives to boost the aviation sector**:
        - Introduction of **air transport bubbles or air travel arrangements** with specific countries,
        - **Disinvestment of Air India**,
        - **Privatization and modernization**
        - Expansion of airports,
        - Boost the **regional connectivity** 
        - **Scheme - UDAN.**

## Investment Models

- **Investment**
        - Investment refers to the process of channelizing the capital to increase income with fixed asset formations, and adding machinery and valuables.
    - **Investment Models:**
        - In terms of models, an investment could be:
            - **Public Investment-** whereby raising savings and advancing sovereign loans government tries to invest (classical Harrod -Domar, Mahalanobis Approach)
            - **Private Investment**- to facilitate the private sector locally and via foreign investments (FDI and FPI ) which facilitate credit flow, increase in demand and money multiplier impact
            - **Public-Private Partnership -** In such investment models both the public sector and private sectors come together for
                - **a. Risk sharing**
                - **b. Technological collaboration**
                - **c. Financing the project and ensuring VGF (viability gap funding refers to the funding of those pending projects which are likely to be profitable and near completion but due to financial crunch are on standby)**
                - **Viability Gap Funding (VGF) refers to financial assistance provided to support projects that are considered economically justified but commercially unviable. In other words, these projects have the potential to create positive benefits for society or the economy, but they may not be able to generate enough revenue on their own to be financially sustainable.**
    - **Different types of PPP models:**
        - **EPC**
            - EPC is an acronym for Engineering, Procurement and Construction in connection with projects such as roads railways etc.
            - It is a standard term that refers to a special form of project execution and contract design.
            - It obliges the contractor to hand over the completed construction such as a road to the client.
            - Normally, the EPC service provider is obliged to complete the construction project within a given time and budget – such agreements are also known as lump-sum turnkey (LSTK) contracts.
            - In this type of contract, the contractor is responsible for all engineering services, the procurement and production of all necessary construction materials and parts, as well as construction and commissioning.
        - **BOT-** built Operate and Transfer
            - The private sector finances, builds, operates, and transfers (BOT) the asset to the public sector after a concession period.
            - Suitable for high-cost infrastructure projects like toll roads or power plants.
            - Example: A private company builds and operates a toll road over 25 years before transferring it to the government.

- **BOOT -** built operate own and transfer
        - Similar to concessions, but the private sector retains ownership of the asset and leases it to the public sector for a period.
        - Can be used for assets with potential future commercial value.
        - Example: A private company builds and leases a government office building for 30 years.

- **BOT – ANNUITY-** in such models after commercialization of the projected annuity will be given
        - In this model, the private sector finances, builds, operates, and maintains the asset for a concession period before transferring it to the government. However, under the Annuity variant, the government pays the private sector a fixed annual payment based on the project cost throughout the concession period, regardless of the actual revenue generated.
    - **BOT-TOLL-** in such models built operate toll and transfer

- **Hybrid annuity**
        - In India, the HAM is a combination of **BOT Annuity and EPC models.** 
        - As per the design, the government will contribute 40% of the project cost in the first five years through annual payments (annuity). The remaining payment will be made on the basis of the assets created and the performance of the developer.
        - How it works
            - Government Contribution: The government provides 40% of the project cost in upfront installments based on achieving predetermined milestones during construction. This reduces the financial burden on the private sector compared to other BOT models.
            - Private Sector Contribution: The private sector finances the remaining 60% of the project cost, typically through a combination of equity and debt. They are responsible for designing, procuring, constructing, operating, and maintaining the asset throughout the concession period.
            - Annuity Payments: Once construction is complete, the government starts making annual payments to the private sector based on a pre-determined formula that considers the project cost, interest rate, and concession period. These payments cover both the cost of operating and maintaining the asset as well as a return on the private sector's investment.
        - Here, a hybrid annuity means the first 40% payment is made as a fixed amount in five equal instalments whereas the remaining 60% is paid as a variable annuity amount after the completion of the project depending upon the value of assets created. 
        - As the government pays only 40%, during the construction stage, the developer should find the money for the remaining amount.
        - Here, he has to raise the remaining 60% in the form of equity or loans.

- **Advantages of HAM:**
        - The advantage of HAM is that it gives enough liquidity to the developer and the financial risk is shared by the government. While the private partner continues to bear the construction and maintenance risks as in the case of the BOT (toll) model, he is required only to partly bear the financing risk. The government’s policy is that the HAM will be used in installed projects where other models are not applicable.

- **Swiss challenge**
        - The Swiss challenge method is a process of giving contracts where any proponent with credentials can submit a development proposal to the government. That proposal will be made available online, and a second proponent can give suggestions to improve and beat that proposal.”
        - There are two different patterns which the commissioning entity may adopt:
            - The government may purchase the intellectual property rights for a project concept from the proponent or then award the project through a competitive bidding process in which no bidder has a predefined advantage.
            - The government can offer the original proponent an advantage in a competitive bidding process In this case the government should create rewards that satisfy the original proponent while still allowing a truly competitive process.
    - **Private Finance Initiative**
        - Under a private finance initiative, the private company handles the up-front costs instead of the government. The project is then leased to the public and the government authority makes annual payments to the private company. These contracts are typically given to construction firms and can last as long as 30 years or more.
        - Private finance initiatives were first implemented in the United Kingdom in 1992 and became more popular after 1997.
        - They are used to fund major public works projects such as schools, prisons, hospitals, and infrastructure. Instead of funding these projects upfront from taxpayers, private firms are hired to design, finance, manage, and complete the projects.
        - The government of India is now using it primarily in health infrastructure.
    - **Vijay Kelkar Committee:**
        - **Key challenges:**
            - Lack of institutional arrangements for financial risks mitigation
            - Lack of institutional arrangements for long-term financing
            - Policy and regulatory gap
            - Project delays resulting in an overcasting burden

- **Recommendations:**
        - A three-dimensional approach to “ governance, institutions and capacity building”
        - To develop PPP laws and an independent regulator and facilitator
        - Special amendments in the Prevention of corruption act 1988 regarding investment-related corruption.
        - More organized and professional dispute resolution mechanism.

- **A Concession agreement(CA)** is a legal contract that forms the basis of the public-private partnership(PPP). It contains the terms and conditions of liabilities and responsibilities of the stakeholders and the revenue model for the development of a project.
