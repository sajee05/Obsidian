### Prehistory - no written accounts of this age

- - Indian stone age has been divided into three ages based on the geological age, stone tools, and subsistence base.

- - **Palaeolithic:**

- - It started 2 million years ago.
    - Early life started at the foothills of mountains where the river was narrow and easy to cross as compared to plains.
    - Caves were the natural places of residence.
    - Hunting & gathering were the main activities for survival.
    - Different varieties of stone tools with irregular shapes were developed which became smaller and more refined with time.
    - Few sites Ismapur in Karnataka (centre of stone tools), Belen valley in Mirzapur Uttar Pradesh, Sohan Valley in Pakistan.
        - Presence of Acheulean stone tools suggesting early human occupation.
    
    - **It is further divided into:**
    - a. Lower: 2 million years ago till 100000 years ago.
    - b. Middle: 100,000 to 40000 BC.
    - c. Upper: 40,000 BC to 10,000 BC.

**Mesolithic Age**

- - It was from 10,000 BC to 6000 BC.
    - It was a hunting-gathering time.
    - It was dominated by microliths.
    - The man moved to plains and started constructing homes of bamboo & grass.
    - Early signs of agriculture and the early domestication of animals have also been witnessed.
    - First evidence of disposal of the dead in the form of burials has also been found.
    - Bhimbetka Rock Shelters (Madhya Pradesh)
    - Adamgarh (Madhya Pradesh)

 **Neolithic Age**

- - It was from 6000 BC to 3000 BC.
    - This is the era when the food production and domestication of plants and animals started.
    - The subsistence strategy shifted from hunting & gathering to animal rearing and agriculture.
    - The tools became sharper and polishing technology also developed.
    - Mehargarh in Pakistan & Burzohom in J&K are important neolithic sites.
        - Burzahom of Kashmir, domestic dogs were buried with their masters in their graves.
    - In Mehargarh we find the evidence of the first village settlement & In Burzohom underground pits have been found may be to store the excess of agricultural produce.

- - Neolithic टाइम में मेहरगढ़ के कुत्ते बुर्ख़ पहनते थे

- - Produced wheat and barley
    - Domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats

- - Subsequent settlement produced ragi, horse gram (millets) and rice

### The Indus Valley Civilization(IVC):

- - ![Ancient India --- प्राचीन इतिहास](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Ancient India --- प्राचीन इतिहास 1.png>)

Port Town - NBSLDR (नयी बस से लाला दोस्तों के साथ रामपुरा गया)

- - The IVC is mainly divided into three phases:
    - The Early Phase:(3300 to 2600 BC)
    - The Mature Phase:(2600 to 1900 BC)
    - The Late Phase:(1900 to 1300 BC)

**Urban infrastructure:**

- - IVC is considered to be the first urban settlement in the world and many cities indicate remarkable organization for example:
    - There was well-ordered waste water drainage.
    - Trash collection system.
    - Public baths & granaries or warehouses.
    - Advanced architecture with dockyards, brick platforms.
    - Both Harappa & Mohenjo-Daro had citadels, a central area in the city that was heavily fortified.
    - However, there is no conclusive evidence of grand palaces or temples.

**Advancement in innovation & technology:**

- - IVC developed a great accuracy in their systems and tools for measuring length and mass.
    - Standard weight and measures
    - Fire backed bricks were uniform in size and moisture resistant.
    - Urban sanitation was well developed along with sewage and drainage systems.
    - Individual homes drew water from wells while wastewater was directed to covered drains on the main streets.

**Seals(ठप्पा) of IVC:**

- - Seal carving that is cutting patterns into the bottom face of a seal is a distinctive feature of IVC.
    - they were used for identification of the property, and to stamp the claim on trade goods.
    - Many seals decorated with animal figures such as elephants, tigers, water buffalos, as well as some mythical animals such as unicorns have been found.
    - They also had knowledge of metallurgy and the science of working with copper, bronze, lead & Tin.
    - Iron was not known to IVC people.(was popular or maybe known in times of Mauryan empire)

**Trade:**

- - People of IVC also participated in a vast maritime trade network extending from central Asia to the Middle East.
    - This trade was facilitated by advancements in transport technology like the use of Ox carts, boats, etc.
    - Important traded goods were pots, metals, beads, seashells, pearls, and coloured gemstones.
    - They brought copper from Oman and Khetri Mines,

**Religion & Culture:**

- - The Indus script remains undeciphered without any similar scripts or symbols.
        - They were supposedly written from right to left.
    - religion remains a topic of speculation, it has been suggested that people worshipped the mother goddess who symbolized fertility.

- - **Institution & Hierarchies:**
    - IVC was an egalitarian society however we have no way of knowledge regarding a centre of authority.
    - Many people enjoyed relatively equal wealth which can be deciphered from the mortuary analysis(study of graves)
    - It is also widely believed that the civilization was peaceful and did not engage in warfare's, weapons have been found at sites but we have no evidence if they were used in warfare or defence against wild animals.

**The decline of IVC:**

- - One theory suggested that a nomadic Indo-European tribe called the Aryans invaded & conquered the IVC, though recent evidence contradicts this claim.
    - Most scholars today believe that the collapse of IVC was caused by Climate Change.
    - Some believe it may have occurred to draughts owing to changing pattern of monsoon.
    - Or Maybe a tectonic event diverted or disrupted the river systems which were the lifelines of the IVC. 
    - People may have migrated to the Ganges basin in small villages.
    - By 1900 BC, the cities had been abandoned.

Some famous sites of IVC:

- - Harappa: The first city that was discovered, known for its textile industry.
    - Mohenjo-Daro is known for the textile industry and great public bath.
    - Rakhigarhi: in Haryana,
    - Dhoulavira: It had an efficient water management system, dams, canals. It had three layers of town planning.
        - Hub of manufacturing jewellery made of shells and semi-precious stones, like agate and used to export timber.
        - Large size sign of Harrapan scripts.
        - Fortified citadel
    - Lothal: Known for rice cultivation, dockyard, and fire alters.
        - _National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal._

- - Banawali: Fire alters & Terracotta.
    - Kalibangan: In Rajasthan, known for the bangles-making industry and ploughed fields.
    - Kot Diji
    - Chahundaro is known for bead-making lipsticks, toy making, it is only Harrapan site which had no citadel.

    - Pustapalas (पुस्तपालस) was the responsible for keeping and managing records.

**Shreni(श्ररेड़ि)/Guilds**

    - These guilds enjoyed certain immunities, for example, they were governed by their own laws.
    - We find elements of feudalism in the Gupta administration. For example, a major part of the empire was held by feudatory chiefs, higher officials were paid in cash, however, some were also given land grants. Religious functionaries were granted land free of tax. They were also authorised to collect taxes and punish criminals.

**Economy:**

- - Guptas issued the largest number of Gold coins called **Dinaras.**

    - Many types of land grants were given. For example, **Agrahar** to Brahmans, which was tax-free and hereditary, **Devagrahar** to Brahmans and merchants for repair and worship of temples and **secular grant** to feudatories.
    - Mining and metallurgy flourished.
    - **Many types of taxes were imposed such as:**
        - **Bhag**- part of one's produce- part of the regular tax- tax in cash
        - **Bhog**- supply of fruits and vegetables- tax in kind
        - **Kar** - a periodic tax imposed on a group of villages
