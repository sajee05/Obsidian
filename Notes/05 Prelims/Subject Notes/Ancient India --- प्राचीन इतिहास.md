### PREHISTORY - NO WRITTEN ACCOUNTS OF THIS AGE

-   Indian stone age has been divided into three ages based on the geological age, stone tools, and subsistence base.

#### PALAEOLITHIC

-   It started 2 million years ago.
-   Early life started at the foothills of mountains where the river was narrow and easy to cross as compared to plains.
-   Caves were the natural places of residence.
-   Hunting & gathering were the main activities for survival.
-   Different varieties of stone tools with irregular shapes were developed which became smaller and more refined with time.
-   Few sites Ismapur in Karnataka (centre of stone tools), Belen valley in Mirzapur Uttar Pradesh, Sohan Valley in Pakistan.
    -   Presence of ACHEULEAN stone tools suggesting early human occupation.
-   **It is further divided into:**
    -   a. Lower: 2 million years ago till 100000 years ago.
    -   b. Middle: 100,000 to 40000 BC.
    -   c. Upper: 40,000 BC to 10,000 BC.

#### MESOLITHIC AGE

-   It was from 10,000 BC to 6000 BC.
-   It was a hunting-gathering time.
-   It was dominated by **microliths**.
-   The man moved to plains and started constructing homes of bamboo & grass.
-   Early signs of agriculture and the early domestication of animals have also been witnessed.
-   First evidence of disposal of the dead in the form of burials has also been found.
-   BHIMBETKA ROCK SHELTERS (Madhya Pradesh)
-   ADAMGARH (Madhya Pradesh)

#### NEOLITHIC AGE

-   It was from 6000 BC to 3000 BC.
-   This is the era when the food production and domestication of plants and animals started.
-   The subsistence strategy shifted from hunting & gathering to animal rearing and agriculture.
-   The tools became sharper and polishing technology also developed.
-   MEHARGARH in Pakistan & BURZOHOM in J&K are important neolithic sites.
    -   Burzahom of Kashmir, domestic dogs were buried with their masters in their graves.
-   In Mehargarh we find the evidence of the first village settlement & In Burzohom underground pits have been found may be to store the excess of agricultural produce.
-   Neolithic टाइम में मेहरगढ़ के कुत्ते बुर्ख़ पहनते थे
-   Produced wheat and barley
-   Domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats
-   Subsequent settlement produced ragi, horse gram (millets) and rice

### THE INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION (IVC)

![Ancient India --- प्राचीन इतिहास](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Ancient India --- प्राचीन इतिहास 1.png>)

-   Port Town - NBSLDR (नयी बस से लाला दोस्तों के साथ रामपुरा गया)
-   The IVC is mainly divided into three phases:
    -   The Early Phase: (3300 to 2600 BC)
    -   The Mature Phase: (2600 to 1900 BC)
    -   The Late Phase: (1900 to 1300 BC)

#### URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE

-   IVC is considered to be the first urban settlement in the world and many cities indicate remarkable organization for example:
    -   There was well-ordered waste water drainage.
    -   Trash collection system.
    -   Public baths & granaries or warehouses.
    -   Advanced architecture with dockyards, brick platforms.
    -   Both HARAPPA & MOHENJO-DARO had citadels, a central area in the city that was heavily fortified.
    -   However, there is no conclusive evidence of grand palaces or temples.

#### ADVANCEMENT IN INNOVATION & TECHNOLOGY

-   IVC developed a great accuracy in their systems and tools for measuring length and mass.
    -   Standard weight and measures
    -   Fire backed bricks were uniform in size and moisture resistant.
    -   Urban sanitation was well developed along with sewage and drainage systems.
    -   Individual homes drew water from wells while wastewater was directed to covered drains on the main streets.

#### SEALS (ठप्पा) OF IVC

-   Seal carving that is cutting patterns into the bottom face of a seal is a distinctive feature of IVC.
    -   they were used for identification of the property, and to stamp the claim on trade goods.
    -   Many seals decorated with animal figures such as elephants, tigers, water buffalos, as well as some mythical animals such as unicorns have been found.
    -   They also had knowledge of metallurgy and the science of working with copper, bronze, lead & Tin.
    -   Iron was not known to IVC people. (was popular or maybe known in times of MAURYAN empire)

#### TRADE

-   People of IVC also participated in a vast maritime trade network extending from central Asia to the Middle East.
-   This trade was facilitated by advancements in transport technology like the use of Ox carts, boats, etc.
-   Important traded goods were pots, metals, beads, seashells, pearls, and coloured gemstones.
-   They brought copper from Oman and KHETRI MINES.

#### RELIGION & CULTURE

-   The INDUS script remains undeciphered without any similar scripts or symbols.
    -   They were supposedly written from right to left.
-   religion remains a topic of speculation, it has been suggested that people worshipped the mother goddess who symbolized fertility.

#### INSTITUTION & HIERARCHIES

-   IVC was an egalitarian society however we have no way of knowledge regarding a centre of authority.
-   Many people enjoyed relatively equal wealth which can be deciphered from the **mortuary analysis** (study of graves).
-   It is also widely believed that the civilization was peaceful and did not engage in warfare's, weapons have been found at sites but we have no evidence if they were used in warfare or defence against wild animals.

#### THE DECLINE OF IVC

-   One theory suggested that a nomadic INDO-EUROPEAN tribe called the ARYANS invaded & conquered the IVC, though recent evidence contradicts this claim.
-   Most scholars today believe that the collapse of IVC was caused by Climate Change.
-   Some believe it may have occurred to draughts owing to changing pattern of monsoon.
-   Or Maybe a tectonic event diverted or disrupted the river systems which were the lifelines of the IVC.
-   People may have migrated to the GANGES basin in small villages.
-   By 1900 BC, the cities had been abandoned.

#### SOME FAMOUS SITES OF IVC

-   **Harappa:** The first city that was discovered, known for its textile industry.
-   **Mohenjo-Daro:** is known for the textile industry and great public bath.
-   **Rakhigarhi:** in Haryana.
-   **Dhoulavira:** It had an efficient water management system, dams, canals. It had three layers of town planning.
    -   Hub of manufacturing jewellery made of shells and semi-precious stones, like agate and used to export timber.
    -   Large size sign of HARRAPAN scripts.
    -   Fortified citadel

-   **Chahundaro:** is known for bead-making lipsticks, toy making, it is only Harrapan site which had no citadel.
-   **Desalpur**

## ANCIENT INDIA CLASS 02

#### SKANDAGUPTA (455-467AD)

-   He faced many waves of Huns' invasions.
-   His successors could not save the empire and by the 6th century, the Gupta empire disappeared.

#### THE EMPIRE DECLINED MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS

1.  **Hun invasion**
    -   By 485 AD, Huns under TORAMANA had occupied Punjab, Kashmir, a large part of Central India and a large part of Rajasthan.
    -   His son **Mihirkula** continued the invasion. He was a tyrant ruler who was referred to as the persecutor of Buddhists by KALHAN in RAJ-TARANGINI (राजतरंगिनी) (describes the history of Kashmir in ancient times) and by HIEUN- TSANG in his account.

2.  **Rise of feudatories**
    -   Feudatories in Bihar, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat declared their independence.
    -   Guptas were crippled economically and they could not maintain a large standing army.
    -   After their fall many new dynasties in North India emerged, for example, PUSHYABHUTIS of THANESAR, MAUKHARIES of KANNAUJ and MAITRIKAS of VALLABHI.

    -   **BVVG**
    -   **भुगती विशाखा ने V तीस**
-   **Pustapalas** (पुस्तपालस) was the responsible for keeping and managing records.

##### SHRENI (श्ररेड़ि)/GUILDS

-   Shrenis were associations of traders, merchants and artisans. This system of Guild began in the **Mahajanapada period** and continued throughout the **Mauryan period**. Generally, a separate Shreni existed for a particular group of persons engaged in the same vocation.
-   These guilds enjoyed certain immunities, for example, they were governed by their own laws.
-   We find elements of **feudalism** in the Gupta administration. For example, a major part of the empire was held by feudatory chiefs, higher officials were paid in cash, however, some were also given land grants. Religious functionaries were granted land free of tax. They were also authorised to collect taxes and punish criminals.

##### ECONOMY

-   Guptas issued the largest number of Gold coins called **Dinaras**.

-   The nature of landholding was also different. For example, one of the important landholdings was **Bhumichchi-Dranyaya** (भूमिछि द्रणयाए). Here ownership was given to a person who made a barren land cultivable.
-   Many types of land grants were given. For example, **Agrahar** to Brahmans, which was tax-free and hereditary, **Devagrahar** to Brahmans and merchants for repair and worship of temples and **secular grant** to feudatories.
-   Mining and metallurgy flourished.

##### SOCIETY

-   In society, there was the supremacy of Brahmans.
-   Caste proliferated into many sub-caste.
-   Warriors of foreigners and tribal chiefs were given the status of Kshatriyas.
-   The position of Shudra improved. They were represented as agriculturalists.
-   The number of **Chandals** increased. **Fa-Hein** writes about their deplorable condition. They lived outside the city and dealt mainly in the trade of meat. Whenever they entered the town, they struck a piece of wood to announce their arrival.
-   The position of women declined while women of lower classes were free to earn their livelihood, the same did not happen to women of upper classes.
-   The first example of the immolation of a widow (**sati**) is found during the Gupta period. However, some books also talk about widow remarriage.
-   **Niyog** which was allowed earlier in the Vedic period was not allowed in the Gupta period. Under this practice, a younger brother could marry the wife of an older brother in the eventuality of the death of the older brother.

##### RELIGION

-   **Bhagvatism** (also called Vaishnavism) emerged as the most important Bhakti traditions.
-   **Vishnu** became the most important God along with **Brahma** and **Shiva**.
-   Vaishnavism believed in Bhakti and non-violence which attracted many foreigners and many tribes.
-   History was presented as a cycle of 10 incarnations of Vishnu.
-   Idol worship became a common phenomenon in temples.
-   Guptas showed an overall policy of religious tolerance.

### MAURYAS VS GUPTAS

-   The Mauryan empire was much larger compared to the Gupta empire.
-   Mauryans followed a more centralised administrative structure with the help of a well developed bureaucratic system. In the Gupta empire, bureaucracy was not as elaborate as in Mauryas and many feudatories emerged in the Gupta administration.
-   The taxation system during the Mauryan rule was more stringent. Guptas favoured a liberal tax system.
-   Mauryan rulers patronaged many religions whereas Guptas followed and promoted Vaishnavism.
-   Mauryas were great builders, for example, architectural structures such as stupas and pillars flourished during Mauryan rule whereas Science, Astronomy, and Literature flourished during the Gupta period.
-   External trade and commerce were more during the Mauryan dynasty compared to the Gupta dynasty.
-   Mauryan empire mainly declined because of internal strife while the Guptas faced external threats which led to their decline. ⭐ (While Huns were external, internal factors like weak successors and rise of feudatories were also significant for Guptas. Mauryan decline also had external factors like Greek invasions post-Ashoka, though internal strife and administrative overstretch are often cited. This statement simplifies the complex reasons for decline for both empires.)
-   Later Gupta's
    -   Not related with imperial gupta.
