### Assam Crisis (1979-1985)

- - It started in 1979 due to the inflow of illegal migrants which impacted their livelihood, culture, and political situation in Assam and led to widespread riots which ultimately led to the imposition of the President's rule in Assam.

**Causes of Assam Crisis:**

- - Underdevelopment of Assam.
    - Historical factors like control over public and private sector jobs by Bengali youth etc.
    - Fragmentation of Assam by carving out the tribal areas from Assam.
    - Illegal migration changed the demographic profile of Assam.
    - To control the situation, Assam Accord was signed.

**Punjab Crisis**

- - Sikhism talked about social justice and equality.
    - The Gurudwaras were under the control of corrupt Mahants and to counter them Akalis came forward and demanded that elected representatives should control Gurudwaras. The organization of Akali was Akali Shiromani Dal.
    - Akalis also had political aspirations and demanded a separate Punjab for Sikhs.
    - However, their demands were not met by the State reorganization commission both on religious and linguistic grounds.
    - In 1966, the bifurcation happened because the leader of Akali Dal convinced the government that the demand was linguistic in nature and not on religious grounds and Hindi speakers also demanded the creation of Haryana. However, there was a contention over Chandigarh and it was made a Union Territory.
    - However, Akali Dal didn't come to power.
    - In 1972, the Anandpur Sahib resolution was passed.

**Bofors Scam:**

- - This was a scam involved in the weapon contract signed between India and Sweden during the 1980s and 1990s.

**Kargil War**

    - In 1984, India conducted an invasion of Pakistani forces under Operation Meghdoot and India captured Siachen Glacier.
    - In 1998, both India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests and became Nuclear powers and Lahore Declaration was signed to establish peace in Kashmir.

**Land Reforms**

**Women's Movement:**

- - Women’s movement can be defined as the organized effort to achieve a common goal of equality and liberation of women and it presupposes sensitivities to crucial issues affecting the lives of women.
    - Women’s movements in India can be divided into the following periods or waves:

In western countries, the movements are led by the upper and educated class whereas, in India, they are led by the vulnerable sections of the society.

**Dalit Movements**

- - Dalits are those groups of people who have faced social discrimination including untouchability. They largely belong to the economically disadvantaged groups of our society.
