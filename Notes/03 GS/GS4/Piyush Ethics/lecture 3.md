# Ethics Enrichment CLASS 03: Institutions in Value Inculcation

## Introduction and Preparation Strategy (00:00)

- **Class Objective**: Cover very important topics regarding value inculcation by various institutions
- **Previous Class Review**: Role of family in inculcation of values
- **Key Challenge Identified**: Understanding content vs. reproducing content under time pressure

### Answer Writing Strategy and Time Management

- **Critical Insight**: "It is one thing to understand, it is another thing to remember and it is altogether different thing to reproduce all that content in few minutes"
- **Practice Approach**: Write answers as if preparing for 7-minute responses in actual examination
- **Assessment Method**: Judge preparation by ability to reproduce maximum points in limited time (50-55 seconds for brainstorming)
- **Student Performance Issue**: Only 2 students achieved 90% recall, majority scored less than 50%

### UPSC Paper Strategy

- **Simple vs Complex Questions**: 
  - Simple, straightforward questions are actually more difficult to score high marks
  - When questions are easy, it becomes difficult to differentiate your answer from others
  - Complex questions allow average answers to fetch good marks
- **Differentiation Strategy**: Must be able to open up dimensions quickly under pressure

## Educational Institutions in Value Inculcation (06:03)
