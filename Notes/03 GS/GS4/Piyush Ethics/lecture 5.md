# Ethics Enrichment Class 05 - Foundational Values for Civil Services

## RECAP: OBJECTIVITY AND ITS LIMITATIONS (00:00)

- **Objectivity**: An important attribute for moral decision making, but not the sole criteria for making ethical decisions
- **Value Neutrality**: The concept that data should be neutral, but this has significant limitations

### Limitations of Data-Based Decision Making

- **Data Availability Issues**:
  - Data might not be available
  - Data integrity might be breached  
  - May lack capacity to process the data
  - In emerging situations like disaster management, data may not exist at all

- **Decision Making in Crisis**: 
  - Decisions may need to be based on intuition, experience, and hunch
  - This is where leadership qualities become crucial

- **Emotional Aspects Overlooked**:
  - Crude objectivity overlooks emotional aspects of decision making
  - **NYAMGIRI Case Example**: Tribes regarded their deities as living in the hill, but objective facts showed no proof of ancestors living there
  - Supreme Court upheld tribal rights, demonstrating that emotional component and emotional aptitude are necessary for holistic understanding of societal reality

| Aspect | Objective View | Holistic View Including Emotions |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| NYAMGIRI Case | No factual evidence of ancestors; focus on employment and GDP | Respect for tribal beliefs and emotional connections |
| Decision Outcome | Would favor mining based on economic data | Supreme Court upheld tribal rights |
| Lesson | Facts alone insufficient for good judgment | Emotional understanding necessary for complete picture |

### NYAMGIRI Case as Democracy Case Study

- **Example of Democratic Success**: How seemingly powerless tribals defeated one of the largest MNCs of the world
- **Rule of Law Demonstration**: Great example of how rule of law actually works
- **Applications**: Can be used in polity, governance essays, and case studies anywhere

## IMPARTIALITY vs NONPARTISANSHIP (04:07)

### Key Differences

| Concept | Nature | Characteristics |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Nonpartisanship** | Negative concept | Restricts involvement with political parties |
| **Impartiality** | Positive concept | Encourages interaction with all people without differentiation |

### Circumstances Where Nonpartisanship is Broken

- **Recruitment**: RAJASTHAN Public Service Commission member example
- **Training**: Disparate training opportunities  
- **Promotion, Transfer, Posting**: Post-government change transfers
- **Performance Management**: ACR (Annual Confidential Report) manipulation
- **Post-Retirement Benefits**: Parking lot positions in various institutions
- **Emerging Trends**: Bureaucrats resigning to join politics (setting bad precedent)
- **COALGATE Scam**: Important example of partisan behavior

## INTEGRITY TYPES (05:25)

### Intellectual Integrity

- **Definition**: Being true and consistent with your intellect
- **Key Principle**: Your intellect questions things, so it should question your own biases and prejudices too
- **Application**: Important in society due to prevalent prejudiced and discriminatory attitudes
- **Modern Relevance**: Critical for combating fake information being forwarded on social media

### Other Types of Integrity

- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring accuracy and reliability of information
- **National Integrity**: Loyalty to the nation
- **Organizational Integrity**: Creating robust systems; KYEER must be part of long-term solutions

## WEBER'S THEORY AND VALUE NEUTRALITY (08:20)

### BAVARIAN Bureaucracy Principles

- **Value Neutrality Concept**: Bureaucrats should not have personal preferences while making decisions
- **WEBER's Approach**: Simply look at facts and objectivity
- **Role Division**: 
  - Political executive decides policies and laws
  - Bureaucrat's job is only to efficiently implement them

### Limitations of Excessive Value Neutrality

- **Risk**: Too much neutrality leads to apathy and laziness in bureaucracy
- **Need for Balance**: Must combine objectivity with passionate commitment to public service

## DEDICATION TO PUBLIC SERVICE (09:30)

- **Definition**: Passionate commitment to public cause
- **Nature**: King-size value that includes everything - dedication to public service encompasses all foundational civil service values

### Understanding "Passionate Commitment"

#### Student Analogy
| Type | Behavior | Classification |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Dedicated Student** | Comes punctually, takes notes, asks questions, revises, generates frameworks | True dedication |
| **Mere Attendee** | Comes at 5:30, leaves at 8:00, does nothing after | Attendance without passion |

#### PDS Officer Example
| Approach | Action | Classification |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Rule-bound Officer** | Says "not eligible, please go home" | Commitment to rule of law |
| **Dedicated Officer** | Goes beyond rules to find solution for the lady | Passionate commitment |

### Dedication vs Other Concepts

| Concept | Nature | Duration | Example |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Motivation** | May be episodic | Short-term | Wanting to become IAS to impress someone |
| **Dedication to Public Service** | Lifelong commitment | Long-term | Sustained service regardless of personal circumstances |
| **Commitment** | May be code-driven | Rule-bound | Following rules mechanically |

- **Key Difference**: Passion creates all the difference - positive attitude enables much more impact

## ASPECTS OF DEDICATION TO PUBLIC SERVICE (17:01)

### 1. Passionate Commitment to Public Interest

- **Barometer**: Even when it may harm your own personal interest
- **COVID Warriors Example**: Great example of dedication - they fully knew the risks of infectious disease, many lost their lives while serving public, yet continued their duty with full heart

### 2. Handling Job Pressure

- **Nature of Expectations**: Different sections of society (farmers, teachers, students) have different expectations
- **Challenge**: May not be able to meet all expectations, creating anger, resentment, frustration
- **Requirement**: Remain sufficiently motivated to work even when being abused
- **Personal Life**: Not taking work stress home, performing well despite bad situations at home

#### Sports Examples of Passionate Commitment
- **FATEND TENDULKAR**: Came back to World Cup and played despite losing father during World Cup
- **ANIL KUMBLE**: Bowled with broken jaw - supreme example of commitment
- **GRAEME SMITH**: Came to bat with broken hand when ninth wicket fell, played with one hand
- **MAXWELL**: Another example of extraordinary commitment

### 3. Perseverance

- **Government Reality**: Results do not come early, takes lot of time and effort
- **Nature of Improvement**: Often incremental rather than dramatic
- **Requirement**: Continuous hard work, only possible with passionate commitment to public cause

### 4. Sense of Responsibility

- **Characteristic**: Deep sense of responsibility - "this is my responsibility"
- **Contrast**: Others simply pass the buck to other officers
- **Example**: DIBITA in MUZAFPUR district - water was not available in village for 70 years, but she took it as her own responsibility to get water to that particular place

#### Minimalist vs Maximum Approach
| Approach | Behavior | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Minimalist Guy** | Do bare minimum required | Government doctors/teachers doing minimum work |
| **Dedicated Professional** | Do maximum required | Private school/hospital quality service |
| **Root Cause** | Lack of passionate commitment | Despite having qualified professionals, minimalistic understanding of responsibilities |

### 5. Developmental vs Regulative Work (25:00)

#### Historical Context
- **British Empire Functions**: 
  1. Law and order
  2. Revenue collection
- **Regulative Function**: Merely implementing laws, maintaining status quo
- **Need for Development**: Requires initiative, understanding societal problems, dynamic approach

#### Status Quo vs Developmental Bureaucracy

| Type | Focus | Attitude | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Status Quo Bureaucracy** | Maintaining normalcy | Does not matter if learning levels fall or people die from diseases | Files and committees without field work |
| **Developmental Bureaucracy** | Healthcare, education, poverty, employment indicators | Proactive approach to societal development | Field visits, innovative solutions |

#### District Collector Example
- **Problem**: Overburdened with regulative functions, so many files pending, member of many redundant committees
- **Result**: No time for developmental aspects
- **Requirement**: Go outside office, interact at field, understand district problems, find innovative solutions

#### Practical Examples
- **Communal Riots Prevention**: SP should take preventive peace meetings rather than sitting in office maintaining status quo
- **Disaster Management**: Every year same flash floods in HIMALAYAS with same casualties, but no concrete action taken

### 6. Ethical Conduct (30:15)

#### Three Types of Bureaucrats Scenario
1. **Personally Honest but Passive**: Sees corruption, remains personally honest but takes no action
2. **Honest and Active**: Personally honest AND takes action, plugs organizational integrity gaps, does risk management
3. **Corrupt**: Adapts to corrupt environment, tries to recover money spent on preparation

#### Second ARC Recommendation
- **Performance Review Metric**: Action taken by bureaucrat in office to reduce corruption instances
- **Leadership Initiative**: Expected to take initiatives, not just remain personally honest
- **Assessment Criteria**: Efforts made by bureaucrat should become performance appraisal criteria

### 7. VIP Culture Reduction (34:40)

- **Challenge**: Everyone wants VIP treatment, but requires courage to reduce it for public approachability
- **RAJASTHAN CM Example**: Did away with convoy, stopped green corridor practice in JAIPUR, stood at traffic light with other people

### 8. Problem Solving (35:40)

- **UPSC Focus**: Requires creativity of highest order, innovation, intellectual ability
- **Reality**: Easy to hide behind obstacles (funds, rules, manpower), but takes courage and passionate commitment to deliver solutions

## CASE STUDIES OF PROBLEM SOLVING (37:05)

### SHASHANKA's Initiative - Nutrition Gardens

- **Location**: MAJARAM area, often cut from mainstream due to incessant rain
- **Problem**: Connectivity issues led to delayed essential goods, malnutrition among children
- **Solution**: "My School My Farm" initiative - nutrition gardens set up in ANGANWADI and schools
- **Philosophy**: "We need not innovate always; sometimes simple solutions existing for centuries just need implementation"
- **Result**: Tackled malnutrition arising from disaster-prone and infrastructure bottlenecks

### SEPANDURI's Café Initiative

- **Problem**: People with disabilities approaching for pensions and employment
- **Solution**: Set up café in district collectorate run by persons with disabilities
- **Process**: Organized 45-day training course in cooking and catering
- **Result**: Well-functioning café in district collectorate office, good example of innovation, problem solving, compassion

### SARAN's SI Express

- **Impact**: Reduced expense of people by 90% and ensured timely access to healthcare

### Community Engagement Case Study - Joint Forest Management

#### Origin Story
- **Location**: MIDNAPUR district, WEST BENGAL
- **Officer**: IFS officer conducting silviculture experiments
- **Problem**: Community crossing fields, disturbing plantation
- **Solution**: Made team with community, shared 25% of proceeds
- **Year**: 1988 or 1990
- **Result**: Huge success, gave birth to Joint Forest Management concept, replicated across country

#### Principle of Community Engagement
- **Reality**: Neither party alone can manage large forest areas
- **Need**: Community knows what's happening, provides eyes and ears on ground
- **Examples**: GEAR conservation, MALHARI communities role
- **Application**: Wildlife conservation, forest management always require community participation

### T BHUBALAN's Anti-Child Marriage Initiative

- **Achievement**: Saved 176 kids from child marriage in just one year
- **Approach**: Community engagement and relentless work
- **Impact**: 176 lives that would have been ruined were saved

## ADAPTABILITY AND CONTINUOUS LEARNING (47:30)

### Context of Technological Change

- **Historical Perspective**: Computers in government offices became common only around 2000
- **Challenge**: Bureaucrats recruited before 2000 had to adapt to new technology
- **E-governance Success**: Depends on bureaucracy adapting to new skills and technology

#### Railway Counter Example
- **Scenario**: Two clerks booking TATKAL tickets (get over in 5 minutes)
- **Slow Clerk**: Types very slowly, seats get over before booking
- **Implication**: Capacity matters, need to upgrade skills

### Modern Challenges
- **Emerging Technologies**: Social media, AI, blockchain technology
- **Approach**: Understand and use technology for governance rather than avoiding it
- **Requirement**: Adaptability, domain expertise development for capable delivery

## ARUNA SUNDAR RAJAN Case Study (50:10)

- **Description**: Officer who thinks like a businesswoman
- **Context**: KERALA e-governance project
- **Challenge**: TULIP company applied but had no big background or previous experience
- **Traditional Approach**: Rules require previous experience of many years, specific work amount
- **Problem with Rules**: Large players win tenders repeatedly, no space for small players or innovation

### Innovative Solution
- **Approach**: Asked all bidders to set up pilot projects
- **Selection Criteria**: Chose ones that performed best based on pilot project
- **Result**: TULIP company won the contract
- **Qualities Demonstrated**: Risk taking, innovation, not driven by precedent

### AKSHYA Project Results
- **Scale**: Initially started in district, later replicated in entire state
- **Achievement**: At least one person from each of KERALA's 3.25 million families became computer literate through AKSHYA centers
- **Recognition**: She was awarded for this AKSHYA project, also headed KUDUMBI for some time

## TOLERANCE (72:40)

  - DINI IBADAAT KHANA
  - Not forcing Islam on RAJPUT princesses he married
  - JAZIA tax abolition
  - No demolition of Hindu temples
  - No discrimination between SHIA and SUNNI

#### JAINISM Philosophy
- **SHADWAD**: Philosophical approach where people have different perspectives
- **Core Principle**: No ultimate truth, no one truth
- **Fundamental Answer**: SHYAD (perhaps) - should be the attitude

### Diversity Requiring Tolerance in India

| Type of Diversity | Examples | Conflicts Observed |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Religious** | Multiple religions | Communal tensions |
| **Caste** | Various castes | Caste discrimination |
| **Regional** | Different regions | Hindi vs non-Hindi divide |

## SYMPATHY, EMPATHY, AND COMPASSION (90:30)

### Definitions Through Examples

| Emotion | Level | Response | Example |
|---------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Sympathy** | Cognitive | Feel bad about friend's situation | "Feel sorry for friend's breakup" |
