# Lecture 26: Right to Information (RTI) Act and NGO Governance

## COURSE ADMINISTRATION AND SCHEDULE (0:00)

- Good evening everyone, am I audible online? Nice, how many guest students today - all four
- Discussion about taking classes on Friday to finish the course early
- Already had 4-5 days of leave during the course, this course would have been over by now had it not been for so many holidays
- Today's theme: NGOs - both aspects of how they should be regulated (balance autonomy versus regulation) and how they should conduct their affairs
- Both case studies deal with these two aspects of NGOs
- Another topic: RTI - given some case studies, three of them are PIQS and one is not

## TRANSPARENCY AND RIGHT TO INFORMATION (2:15)

### Definition and Importance of Transparency

- **Transparency**: Increased flow of timely and reliable information so that you can hold the authority accountable
- When information is available to you, you can hold the government accountable
- **Example**: Road construction information boards showing:
  - Road length (6 kilometers connecting villages A and B)
  - Source of funds (MLA funds - 4 crores)
  - Construction company (ABC Private Limited)
- This information allows verification and accountability:
  - Anyone can verify road length
  - Can assess if cost is reasonable for that distance
  - Can check company's track record and potential corruption (related party transactions with MLA)

### Budget as Transparency Tool

- **Line item budgeting**: Allocating funds to specific items of expenditure
- Without line item budgeting, impossible to hold government accountable for money spent
- **Outcome budgeting**: Whether spending achieves intended objectives
  - Example: Building 100 toilets/schools is output, not outcome
  - Need to discuss cleanliness and learning outcomes for true accountability
- **Gender-based budgeting**: Whether expenditure does gender justice and promotes inclusiveness
- **Travel budget**: Whether allocating roughly 8% of expenditure to tribal welfare

### Historical Context

- In earlier times, bureaucracy was wreaking of secrecy
- Secrecy was the hallmark of bureaucracy
- Because of anonymity and secrecy, it was breeding lot of corruption
- RTI Act is the best disinfectant - like sunshine operating as disinfectant

## TYPES OF TRANSPARENCY (7:40)

### Event Transparency
- Shows input, output, and outcome
- **UPSC Example**: Provides answer key for prelims, cutoff marks, marks in mark sheet, final result in merit PDF

### Process Transparency
- What happens between input and output
- **UPSC lacks this**: Don't know how mains copies are evaluated, scaling formula used
- Causes subjectivity and distrust among aspirants
- Government should disclose how they select bidders, why ABC Private Limited got the project

### Real-time Transparency
- Information provided as events occur
- **UPSC doesn't believe in this**: Gives answer key after final result published
- COVID case numbers were more or less live/real-time transparency

### Retrospective Transparency
- Information provided after event has occurred and lot of time has elapsed
- What UPSC practices - telling you after everything is finalized

## RTI ACT PROVISIONS AND SECTIONS (9:48)

### Key Sections of RTI Act

**Section 2F - Public Authority**
- NGOs substantially financed by government come under public authority
- They are legally accountable for RTI

**Section 2J - Right to Information**
- Defines entitlements of applicant seeking information
- Can inspect work, documents, records
- Can take certified samples of material
- Can take photographs

### Suo Moto Disclosure
- Every organization/public authority should disclose information without waiting for RTI to be filed
- Organizations can identify patterns of information requested and disclose proactively
- **Example**: UPSC cutoff and answer key now given without asking
- One of biggest weaknesses: provides lot of discretion that negative-minded officers can misuse by not disclosing information

### Overriding Effect of Official Secrets Act
- If RTI promotes public interest and benefits outweigh costs, can disclose information even against Official Secrets Act
- When two rules conflict, comes down to discretion and role of conscience
- This is limitation of laws/rules as source of ethical guidance

### Exceptions
- IPR (Intellectual Property Rights)
- Right to privacy is important exception

**Section 5C - Reasonable Assistance**
- Every PIO must render reasonable assistance to person seeking information
- "Reasonable assistance" is subjective and can be misused
- People may not interpret this in best public interest
- Can be quoted as example of discretion where law may not provide source of ethical guidance

### Timelines and Appeals
- **Timelines**: 30 days usually, 48 hours if life/liberty involved
- **Section 19 - Appeal Authority**: Can appeal within 30 days to officer senior to PIO
- If still not satisfied, can approach CIC/SIC under Section 19(3)
- Dedicated mechanisms for grievance redressal with time limits (total 45 days for appeals)

**Section 20 - Penalty on PIO**
- Penalty for: refusing to receive application, not furnishing information within time, malafidely denying information, knowingly giving incorrect/incomplete/misleading information
- **Important**: Giving only required amount of information (and withholding rest) is legal offense under Section 20
- Burden of proof that decision was reasonable/intelligent shall be on PIO, not applicant
- Heavy burden on PIO to justify every decision

## EFFECTIVE GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL MECHANISMS (17:25)

### RTI as Model for Grievance Redressal

**RTI teaches components of effective grievance mechanism:**

1. **Legal Sanctions**: RTI has legal backing (unlike failed schemes without legal sanctions)
2. **Clear Entitlements**: Section 2J clearly defines what applicant is entitled to
3. **Timelines**: Service delivery within 30 days, appellate authority also has timelines
4. **Internal Appellate Mechanism**: 
   - Provides recourse at local level
   - Not expensive to access compared to going to CIC/SIC
   - Gives monitoring at local level
   - Every applicant need not come to state/higher level
5. **External Appellate Mechanism**: CIC/SIC when internal mechanism cannot be trusted

**Template for Creating Grievance Mechanisms:**
- When creating grievance mechanism as DM/SDM, ensure these components
- Legal sanctions may not be in your hand (can recommend)
- Other components are in your control for institutional design
- Make citizens feel entitled through these mechanisms

## CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF RTI ACT (24:48)

### Framework for Analyzing Any Institution/Law

**Always analyze from these perspectives:**
1. **Legal Perspective**: Loopholes in the act itself
2. **Personnel/Human Resource**: Appointment and transfer procedures
3. **Institutional Perspective**: Nature of appointments and removal
4. **Functional Perspective**: How institution operates
5. **Funds Perspective**: Whether they have discretionary funds
6. **Infrastructure Perspective**: Physical and technical capabilities
7. **Attitudinal Perspective**: Mindset and work culture
8. **Bureaucratic Perspective**: Administrative challenges

### Major Hindrances to RTI Implementation

#### Infrastructure Issues
- **Ineffective Record Management System**: Records not maintained properly
- Files under huge dust piles, not properly indexed by year/roll number
- **60% of public authorities in India lack necessary infrastructure and resources** to manage RTI applications
- Need photocopy machines, scanning equipment to provide information

#### Human Resource Challenges
- **No separate recruitment of PIOs**: Existing officers made PIOs additionally
- Managing information requires specific skills that come with time
- As soon as officers master the skill, they get transferred
- **Only 30% of public officials have received adequate training on RTI**
- Officers adopt negative mindset, denying information under frivolous reasons

#### Monopoly of Civil Servants in Information Commissions
- **SIC and CIC positions become parking lots for retired bureaucrats**
- Bureaucrats trained in maintaining secrecy now manning transparency institutions
- Should have people with history of advocating transparency, RTI movement participants
- Most appointments done by political proximity rather than qualification/aptitude
- **Common criticism applicable to most constitutional positions**

#### Legal and Autonomy Issues
- **RTI Act amendments curtailed autonomy of information commissions**
- Federal government can now decide many things
- Lack of autonomy affects independent functioning

#### Enforcement Challenges
- **Penalties are weak**: Maximum penalty under Section 20 is very less
- **PIOs routinely rejecting RTI applications**
- **PMO had 90% application rejection rate**
- **40% of all rejections did not invoke valid reason** according to CIC
- Applications returned on vexatious/frivolous grounds without proper reasoning

#### Institutional Overburden
- **Information commissions are overburdened**
- High pendency of cases
- Appointments not done properly, many positions vacant
- Cannot function effectively without adequate members

#### Utilization Challenges
- **Lack of awareness** about RTI entitlements among citizens
- **Language barriers** in filing applications
- **Application fees** can be prohibitive for poor people (though free for BPL)
- Poor people uncertain about RTI outcomes, reluctant to pay fees

#### Misuse of RTI
- **People filing RTI against departmental colleagues**
- **Example**: NABARD officer shunted to library management for routinely filing RTI against colleagues
- **RTI used for blackmail and threats** against officers
- **Diversion of organizational resources** - someone working on your RTI takes time from other productive work
- **Threats to life of RTI activists** - curves the RTI movement by killing people seeking information

#### Analysis and Disclosure Issues
- **Lack of proper analysis of applications** hinders suo moto disclosure
- Requires dedication to public service beyond bare minimum requirements
- Analysis helps understand patterns and prevent applications through proactive disclosure

### Bureaucratic Attitude and Work Culture
- **Bureaucratic values more towards secrecy**, hasn't really changed
- **Information routinely denied** with high rejection rates
- **Valid reasons not given** for denying information
- **Work culture doesn't promote transparency**
- **Doesn't promote effective record management system**

## CASE STUDIES ON RTI AND NGO GOVERNANCE (43:15)

### Case Study 1: Separating Genuine vs Non-Genuine RTI Applications

#### Ethical Issues Identified
- **Rights without responsibility**: People misusing their rights
- **Defeats purpose of the act**: Misuse furthers wrong interests
- **Perfect case study for right versus right**: Even though you have right to do something, should know difference between right and wrong use
- **Spillover effects**: May deny RTI to genuine applicants due to system overburden
- **System capacity limitations**: Can only manage certain number of applications

#### Options Analysis

**Option 1: Ask for Intent/Reasoning**
- **Demerits**: 
  - Goes against spirit of RTI Act
  - Cannot ask why someone is seeking information
  - Gives more discretionary power to PIO that can be abused
  - May deter genuine applicants
  - Against letter and spirit of the act

**Option 2: Locus Standi Argument (Only Affected Parties Can File)**
- **Demerits**:
  - Very much against RTI Act
  - Kills entire RTI movement
  - Vulnerable sections don't file RTI themselves - NGOs, activists file on their behalf
  - Would hinder RTI activism

**Option 3: Committee-Based Decision Making**
- **Merit**: Limits abuse of discretion through collective decision-making
- **Second ARC Recommendations**:
  - PIO may refuse if request is **"manifestly frivolous"**
  - Can refuse if request would **"substantially and unreasonably divert resources"**
  - Such refusal must be communicated within 15 days **with prior approval of appellate authority**
  - All such refusals shall be transferred to CIC/SIC automatically
  - Creates checks and balances to reduce absolute discretion of PIO

**Option 4: Technology and Pattern Analysis**
- AI can help filter applications
- But ultimately human decision needed - cannot prosecute AI under RTI Act
- Someone has to take responsibility for decisions

#### Recommended Approach
- **Use qualified language**: "manifestly frivolous", "substantially and unreasonably divert"
- **Committee-based decisions** with appellate authority approval
- **Automatic transfer to CIC/SIC** for oversight
- **Reduce abuse of discretion** through checks and balances
- **Suo moto disclosure** based on pattern analysis
- **Technology assistance** for filtering, but human decision-making retained

### Case Study 2: NGO-Corporate Collaboration

#### Merits of Accepting Company Proposal
- **Financial resources**: Immediate funding availability
- **Infrastructure improvement**: Better facilities and equipment
- **Corporate expertise**: Technical know-how, project management, construction skills
- **Professional management**: Corporate management practices

#### Demerits of Accepting Company Proposal
- **Autonomy compromise**: May lose independence in decision-making
- **Reputation risk**: Could tarnish NGO's reputation
- **CSR as publicity tool**: Company may use collaboration for marketing
- **Conflict of values**: Mismatch between company and NGO values
- **Sustainability concerns**: Over-dependence on corporate funding
- **Independence compromise**: Core NGO principle at risk

#### General Principles for NGO-Corporate Partnerships
1. **Mission consistency**: Company objectives should align with NGO mission
2. **Shared values**: Both institutions must have compatible values
3. **Transparency**: Clear information flow about funding and activities
4. **Two-way communication**: Ideas and information should flow both directions
5. **Independence maintenance**: NGO autonomy must not be compromised
6. **Motive assessment**: Understand true intent of corporate collaboration
   - Is it genuine social responsibility?
   - Or seeking competitive/market advantage?
7. **Long-term sustainability**: Ensure partnership doesn't create unhealthy dependence

### Case Study 3: NGO Standards of Probity

#### Areas to Address in NGO Functioning

**Governance Perspective:**
- **Independent self-governing structure**: Voluntary nature maintained
- **Independent board of directors**: Oversight of NGO functioning
- **Conflict of interest policies**: Written policies to disclose actual and potential conflicts
- **Detailed code of conduct**: Clear behavioral guidelines
- **Compliance with regulations**: Adherence to government requirements

**Transparency and Accountability:**
- **Annual reports**: Detailed financial and program reporting
- **Financial information disclosure**: Sources of funds and utilization patterns
- **Fund utilization breakdown**: Percentage for programs vs administration
- **Regular auditing**: External audit after certain intervals
- **Public disclosure**: Information available on website and public platforms

**Client/Beneficiary Perspective:**
- **Participatory approach**: Involve beneficiaries in decision-making
- **Community involvement**: Include community members in planning
- **Feedback mechanisms**: Systems to receive and act on beneficiary input
- **Impact assessment**: Measure actual outcomes, not just outputs

**Work Culture and Technology:**
- **Transparent work culture**: Promote openness in operations
- **Technology adoption**: Use technology for transparency and efficiency
- **Staff training**: Regular capacity building on ethics and transparency

**Example: Transparency International**
- Publishes detailed financial reports
- Maintains strict code of conduct
- Has independent board of directors
- Holds itself to highest standards since it publishes corruption perception index

### Case Study 4: Government Regulation of NGOs

#### Balancing Regulation and Autonomy

**Learning from Government Organization Management:**
1. **Decentralization**: Activity mapping and principle of subsidiarity
2. **Technology utilization**: Digital governance and monitoring
3. **Grading systems**: Similar to MSME grading

#### Recommended Approaches

**Threshold-Based Regulation:**
- **Income-based thresholds**: More regulations for NGOs above certain income levels
- **Graded compliance**: Different compliance requirements based on NGO size/income
- **Punitive action**: Penalties for irregularities detected

**Accreditation System (Second ARC Recommendation):**
- **Independent certification body**: Not necessarily government body
- **Parameter-based rating**: A, B, C, D ratings based on compliance
- **Transparency parameters**: 
  - Publishing audit reports
  - Disclosing fund sources
  - Website maintenance with fund utilization information
- **Incentive structure**: Better ratings attract more donor funding
- **Market mechanism**: Donors can choose based on ratings

**Legal Simplification:**
- **Liberal central law**: Simple registration for multi-state NGOs
- **Reduced regulatory nightmare**: Especially for NGOs operating across states
- **Streamlined compliance**: Simplified procedures and requirements

**Bureaucratic Attitude Change:**
- **Partner in governance approach**: See NGOs as partners, not beneficiaries
- **In-service training modules**: Cooperative relationship building
- **Constructive relationship building**: Move away from adversarial approach

**Process Improvements:**
- **Time-bound procedures**: Fixed timelines for registration, approvals
- **Formal grievance mechanism**: Address NGO complaints systematically
- **Single window clearance**: One-stop solution for multiple approvals
- **Reduced red-tapism**: Minimize bureaucratic delays

**Funding Pattern Changes:**
- **Decentralized funding**: District-level identification and monitoring instead of central
- **Local oversight**: DM/district officials identify and monitor local NGOs
- **Better monitoring**: Easier oversight at ground level
- **Reduced central bottlenecks**: Avoid ministry-level funding complications

### Case Study 5: RTI Disclosure Dilemma

#### Scenario Analysis
- PIO discovers mistake in information that would reflect poorly on department
- Three options presented: follow senior's advice, disclose partial information, or full disclosure

#### Option 1: Follow Senior's Advice
**Merits:**
- **Experience and expertise**: Senior has more knowledge
- **Support availability**: Backing in case of inquiry
- **Shared responsibility**: Burden shared with senior
- **Easy escape**: From personal dilemma and guilt

**Demerits:**
- **Potential illegality**: May violate RTI provisions
- **Compromise of integrity**: Goes against honest disclosure

#### Option 2: Partial Information Disclosure
**Demerits:**
- **Legal liability**: Punishable offense under Section 20
- **Integrity violation**: Against principle of complete honesty
- **Categorical imperative violation**: Even small corrections not allowed
- **Lack of courage**: Shows absence of conviction to take responsibility
- **Trust violation**: Breaches applicant's right and trust
- **Reputation damage**: Harms department's credibility
- **Poor precedent**: Other PIOs may follow this practice
- **Slippery slope**: Once you compromise, easier to do it again
- **Short shelf life**: Truth will eventually come out
- **Work culture deterioration**: Sets wrong organizational precedent

#### Option 3: Creative Solution - Seek Transfer
**Innovative Approach (Student Suggestion):**
- **Recuse yourself**: Transfer RTI handling to another PIO
- **Natural justice principle**: Person should not be judge in own case
- **Objective decision-making**: Other PIO can decide impartially
- **Trust building**: Shows moral courage and responsibility
- **Justice seen to be done**: Not just done, but perceived as fair

**Merits:**
- **Moral courage demonstration**: Taking responsibility for mistake
- **Impartial handling**: Other officer can be more objective
- **Bonafide consideration**: Track record may speak favorably
- **Credibility maintenance**: Shows ethical behavior
- **Precedent setting**: Establishes good practice

**Note**: Usually transfer is not recommended, but this case is exception due to conflict of interest

## GOVERNMENT-NGO BALANCE STRATEGIES (1:16:00)

5. **Infrastructure perspective** - physical and technical capabilities
6. **Attitudinal perspective** - mindset and work culture changes needed

### Key Recommendations Summary
- **Activity mapping** and **principle of subsidiarity**
- **Threshold-based regulation** with graded compliance
- **Independent accreditation systems** for transparency
- **Decentralized funding patterns** for better monitoring
- **Bureaucratic attitude change** through training
