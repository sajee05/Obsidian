## ARMS TRADE ETHICS DISCUSSION (03:57)

### Initial Question Framework
**Question:** As an arms exporter of a responsible nation like India, what are the ethical issues involved in arms trade?

### Fundamental Ethical Perspectives

#### Arguments Supporting Arms Trade
- **Sovereign Right and Responsibility:** Every state has sovereign responsibility to protect and how will the state protect without weapons
- **Manufacturing Limitations:** Not every state can manufacture weapons
- **India's Leadership Role:** As leader of Global South, otherwise there will be Matsya Raj
- **UN Charter Compliance:** States can maintain independent military strength as per UN Charter

#### Ethical Concerns and Issues

**Character and Image Impact:**
- If we promote arms trade to an extent that we are generating so much profit from it, profit becomes the perspective then it might take hit
- It might dent our image as a non-violent nation
- Our virtue ethics talks about the character of individual, in this case we are talking about the character of a nation
- Our nation is characterized by non-violent approach
- We can be called merchant of death also

**Soft Power Implications:**
- This image of non-violent nation if takes hit then it will affect our soft power as well

**Responsibility Framework:**
- It is our duty also because of the legacy of a responsible nation that we must ensure the responsible end use
- Whatever arms trade we are doing, whatever arms we are providing, we must ensure that there is responsible end use

**Risk Management Requirements:**
- We need to ensure before we are indulging in all these trade that we ensure sufficient risk management practices
- The regulatory architecture should be there that it will protect against the misuse of those weapons

### Case Study Examples
- **Afghanistan Example:** We have been providing only humanitarian aid mostly because we did not have this confidence in the state's capacity to manage the fallout
- **End Use Assurance:** As a responsible nation we need to ensure that the end use will be for the peaceful purposes only or as per with respect to international conventions only

### Conflict of Interest Considerations
- **Diplomatic Goals vs Profit:** If we are too driven by this arms trade then it may compromise our diplomatic goals
- **Taking Sides Problem:** Countries start taking sides as soon as there is some violence in the country, and they start supplying ammunition and arms which will keep the conflict going
- **Peace vs Profit:** As a responsible nation which promotes non-violence, which promotes peaceful methods of resolution of any dispute

### Economic vs Ethical Balance
**Economic Benefits:**
- The arms trade will definitely help economically also in terms of forex, employment, tax
- Arms industry is one such industry that is driven by innovation
- If arms trade is very high then it can foster innovation for which we can have a spill over impact in other sectors also
- Example: UAV drones initially were thought that they will be helpful in military objectives only but now we see peaceful and civilian use of drones as well

**Black Market Argument:**
- If we stop arms trade all together, suppose we do not indulge in arms trade, then that will encourage black marketing
- This is a generic argument against total ban actually
- The argument against total ban is that it will encourage the black marketing and you will not have much control then
- You will be losing the taxation revenue and you will not have that much control over the quality

### Decision-Making Framework

**Five Ethical Factors for Arms Trade Decisions:**

1. **Cosmopolitanism and Virtue of the Nation**
2. **Virtue of the Nation to whom we are exporting** - Track record of the nation basically
3. **Type of Arms** - Very good factor - they should not be weapons of mass destruction, they should not be something that has been banned by international community
4. **Legitimacy of Entity** - We cannot provide weapons to Taliban, we can provide weapon to only democratic country, only democratic government
5. **Due Diligence Requirements** - What is the end use, what is the capacity of the nation to manage fallout

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance
- **UN Charter Adherence:** States have inalienable right to exercise their self defense
- **Character Assessment:** Track record of the nation - is it like North Korea or is it like South Korea
- **Conditionality Agreements:** They should be matter of last resort, should be used in self defense and they should not violate the UN laws
- **Primary Objective:** Ultimately aim is to establish peace not the profit hearing

### Safeguards and Risk Mitigation
- **Adequate Safeguards:** Whether there are adequate safeguards against divergence
- **Management Capacity:** Whether the country to whom you are exporting is able to have the capacity to manage the fallout
- **Decision Tree Approach:** You can draw a decision tree for logical way of arriving at the conclusion

## CORRUPTION MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES (18:37)

### Fundamental Formula
**Second ARC Statement:** Monopoly plus Discretion minus Accountability is equal to Corruption
- The more monopoly is there, more discretion is there and the lesser accountability is there will lead to more and more corruption

### Anticipating Specific Threats

#### Risk Assessment Methods
1. **Ethics Audit** - To identify the risk (e.g., tendering, recruitment processes which are more vulnerable)
2. **Legal Audit** - To identify whether laws have certain loopholes which have been misused by civil servants
3. **Institutional Audit** - For example police reforms, whatever committee recommendations they have done

#### Risk Profiling Approaches
**Job Profiling:**
- Certain offices have more discretion
- Which have more public interface and therefore those jobs are more vulnerable for corruption
- Examples: TT, Patwari, Driving License, Passport services, PDS

**Personnel Profiling:**
- Past track record can be seen
- How much of that particular officer has taken in terms of inculcation of ethics
- Whether there have been certain pending inquiries or not

#### Second ARC Recommendations
- **High Risk Job + Low Risk Person:** For high risk jobs you appoint low risk person
- **Low Risk Job + High Risk Person:** Positions which have low risk job like secretariat work, routine functioning, you may appoint high risk individuals

### Proactive Risk Management Measures

#### Systematic Reforms
- **Committee Based Decision Making** - Reducing discretion by committee based decision making
- **Supervision Enhancement** - Very important aspect
- **Annual Confidential Report Enhancement** - Should include the efforts by the supervisor to ensure integrity
- **Leader vs Manager Distinction** - A leader will take more action, will be proactive

#### Transparency and Accountability
- **Promoting Transparency** - Sunlight is the best disinfectant, more disclosure under RTI
- **Simplifying Transactions** - Like single window reform to reduce complexity
- **Auctioning in Resource Allocation** - To reduce monopoly

### Administrative Processes

#### Essential Components
1. **Documentation Standards** - Proper documentation of decision premises
2. **Supervision Mechanisms** - Annual confidential report will include efforts to ensure integrity
3. **Grievance Redressal** - Monitoring of complaints, external and periodic audit
4. **Integrity Pact** - Standard practice in public procurement developed by Transparency International

#### Technology Integration
- **DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer)**
- **Citizen Charter Development**
- **E-governance Initiatives**

### Long-term Measures

#### Civil Services Reforms
1. **Recruitment Reform** - To get people who are more ethically competent
2. **Performance Management** 
3. **Sensitivity Training**
4. **Protecting Honest Civil Servants** - So that people are not harassed and demotivated
5. **Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct**

  - Citizen engagement
  - Risk management

## IMPACT ON CIVIL SERVICES FUNCTIONING (35:51)

### Negative Effects of Over-Cautious Approach

#### Operational Impact
- **Risk Aversion** - Lack of innovation, policy paralysis
- **Lowering of Motivation and Morale**
- **Loss of Competent Officers** - Merit based people will not come to the service
- **Credibility and Trust of Public Loss**
- **Unnecessary Litigations** - Cost on judiciary, over burden judiciary will be further over burden

#### Cultural Consequences  
- **Decreased Accountability** - A culture of blame rather than a culture of responsibility
- **Innovation Barriers** - Risk taking that is required for improvement of public service delivery will not happen

### Measures to Address Over-Cautious Behavior

#### Preventive Approach
**Documentation and Process:**
- Whatever decision premises that is there, it is properly documented
- On what basis you are making a decision and where there is discretion you can involve committee
- Committee based examination with different parameters

#### Assessment Parameters
**Context-Sensitive Evaluation:**
- **Hindsight should not be the basis** - You need to understand the prevailing circumstances
- **Contributing Factors Analysis** - What are the contributing factors like contributing negligence on the part of employer and employee
- **Responsibility Fixation** - Whether responsibility is with respect to monitoring or with respect to sanction level

#### Supportive Environment Creation
**Learning Culture Development:**
- **Establish supportive and learning environment** where mistakes are seen from the perspective of stepping stone
- **Google Case Study Example** - How Google treats failures as learning opportunities
- **Training and Guidance** - For risk management, decision making
- **Internal Review and Feedback** - That talks about corrective measures without resorting to punitive action

#### Accountability Framework
**Proportionate Response:**
- **Loss Value Based** - Accountability framework should be based on the loss value
- **We cannot disproportionately focus on routine losses** because it will over burden the bureaucracy
- **Impact Assessment** - What is the impact of that loss and that was accountability only have to be fixed

## BEHAVIORAL CHANGE AND ATTITUDE MODIFICATION (47:40)

### Ethical Considerations in Policy Implementation

#### Fundamental Dilemma

- **White Man's Burden** - We know best, we are the fountain head of knowledge and you do as per what we are prescribing

#### Utilitarian Perspective (Common Good)
- **Public Health Imperative** - If there is any sanitation problem in a particular part of city, it will snow ball to other boundary
- **Territorial Boundaries Irrelevance** - Environmental pollution crosses boundaries
- **Disease Outbreak Prevention** - There will be outbreak of cholera or so many communicable disease that will spill over to other communities
- **State Duty** - Welfare state, fundamental duty
