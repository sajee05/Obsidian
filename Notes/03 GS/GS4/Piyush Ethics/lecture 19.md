## Case Study 1: Rashika - Work-Life Balance Dilemma (01:06)

### Background Context

- **Previous UPSC patterns**: Similar case studies have been asked before in context of Rakesh character
- This case study extends earlier UPSC questions about conflicts between ethics in public relationship and private relationship

### Ethical Issues Analysis

#### From Rashika's Perspective
- **Golden mean principle**: Work-life balance violation

- **Denied fairness**: Husband not taking equal responsibility for children
- **Systemic discrimination**: Present against women
- **Double burden**: Professional responsibilities + familial responsibilities

## Case Study 2: Ethics vs. Unfair Practices Debate (22:22)

### General Perception Analysis

- **Common belief**: Adhering to ethical conduct causes difficulties and family problems
- **Contrasting view**: Unfair practices help reach career goals
- **Application context**: Similar to sand mafia case study scenarios

### Arguments Against Unfair Practices

#### Counter to "Family Safety" Claim
- **Shelf life of lies**: Very small, law will eventually catch up
- **Greater humiliation**: Family will face more problems when truth emerges
- **Bad precedent**: Acting as poor role model for family
- **Crisis of conscience**: Immense guilt from unethical actions

#### Counter to "Career Goals" Claim
- **Duty-based approach**: Emmanuel Kant's categorical imperative
- **Long-term vs. short-term**: Short-term benefits vs. long-term fulfillment
- **True purpose**: Positions are means to serve public, not ends in themselves

#### Individual Impact Arguments
- **Historical examples**: Gandhi, Mandela made significant differences
- **Institutional comparisons**: UPSC vs. State Public Service Commissions
- **T.N. Seshan example**: Pre and post-Seshan election commission phases
- **Truth principle**: "Truth is truth even if no one believes it"
- **Individual responsibility**: Karma and categorical imperative concepts

### Development vs. Ethics Analysis

#### False Dichotomy Addressed
- **True development definition**: Requires ethical means for sustainability and inclusiveness
- **DBT example**: Innovation through ethical means
- **Sustainability argument**: Unethical development is not lasting
- **Inclusiveness requirement**: Fair distribution of rewards and punishment

#### Consequences of Unethical Development
- **Market failure**: Level playing field disruption
- **Innovation hindrance**: Unfair competition prevents genuine innovation
- **Foreign investment impact**: Ethical environment attracts investors
- **Democratic governance**: Unethical practices undermine democracy
- **Environmental concerns**: Short-term GDP growth vs. climate change consequences
- **Social unrest**: Exclusive development creates rebellion conditions

### Small Gifts and System Efficiency

#### The "Good Corruption" Argument
- **Statement analysis**: Small gifts allegedly make system more efficient
- **Slippery slope principle**: Small compromises lead to larger ones
- **Integrity definition**: Wholesomeness of character - cannot be compartmentalized
- **Work culture impact**: Creates expectation of gifts, leads to red-tapism
- **Virtue ethics**: Wrong means are inherently wrong regardless of scale

### Legal and Ethical Framework for Compensation

#### Fundamental Compensation Duty
- **Organizational responsibility**: Ethical obligation exists regardless of negligence
- **CSR principle**: Government's duty toward employees similar to corporate CSR
- **Work culture**: Organizations must care for employees

#### Key Compensation Factors

**1. Course of Employment Test:**
- **Definition**: Whether accident occurred during employment hours/duties
- **Application**: Driver was on duty, so criterion met

**2. Arising Out of Employment Test:**
- **Definition**: Whether accident cause relates to nature of employment
- **Consideration**: Nature of job hazards and work environment stress

**3. Nature of Occupation Analysis:**
- **High-risk jobs**: Mining, hazardous environments deserve higher compensation
- **Stress factors**: Impact of working conditions on employee behavior
- **Environmental conditions**: Busy, congested roads as occupational hazard

**4. Negligence Assessment:**

- **Working condition stress**: Impact on mental health and reactions

#### Precedent and Legal Considerations

**Compensation Precedents:**

- **Mumbai bus case**: 50% relief for person who jumped from moving bus
- **Supreme Court principle**: Death of government employee doesn't automatically entitle family to job

**Proportional Compensation Model:**
- **100% employer fault**: Full compensation
- **100% employee fault**: Some compensation still due
- **Contributory negligence**: Proportional compensation based on fault percentage

### Decision-Making Framework

#### Essential Considerations
1. **Precedent impact**: Decision becomes precedent for future cases
2. **Rule of law**: Equal treatment in equal circumstances
3. **Promptness**: Compensation should be given within 30 days

- **Public interest**: Essential services disrupted by strike

#### Available Options
1. **Strict no**: Refuse both compensation and employment demands
2. **Full acceptance**: Grant both extra compensation and employment

4. **Mediation**: Form committee with retired judges, NGO representatives
5. **Legal route**: Address strike as obstruction of essential services

### Ethical Dilemmas Framework

#### Key Dilemmas

4. **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Immediate relief vs. future implications
5. **Public loss vs. Family needs**: Strike damages vs. family justice
