# Ethics Enrichment Class 21: Transparency, RTI, and NGO Governance

## TRANSPARENCY AND RIGHT TO INFORMATION CONCEPTS (00:00)

- **Transparency**: Information should be timely and reliably available for the general scrutiny of the public
- The key words here are **timely** and **reliable availability** of the information
- Process transparency is as important as event transparency

### Types of Transparency

**Event Transparency:**
- Basically about the input, output and the outcomes that are there
- For example, you would have seen in your neighborhood that a particular road was constructed by the MLA development fund and this much amount of money was spent and what is output that many length of the kilometer of the road that is there
- All those posters are basically about event transparency

**Process Transparency:**
- What takes behind that meaning how exactly the road contractor was selected in building that particular road
- How are the raw materials sourced by the local contractor

**Real-time Transparency vs Retrospective Transparency:**
- UPSC has retrospective transparency because it gives you answer key and all your marks after long long time
- Real-time transparency like Arogya you know it was providing live information to you

**UPSC Process Transparency Issue:**
- UPSC does not disclose process transparency to us, thereby having lot of subjectivity with respect to examination process

## RTI ACT PROVISIONS AND KEY SECTIONS (04:22)

### Section 2 - Definitions

- **Public Authority**: An NGO that is substantially financed by the government comes within the definition of this
- **Section 2J**: Talks about the right to information and under that right all these things are covered that includes inspection of work documents taking certified sample of material

### Section 4 - Duty to Publish Suo Moto Disclosure (05:02)

- **Important obligation**: Every public authority should proactively publish a certain category of information
- **Discretion aspect**: Has lot of discretion in the hands of officers and institutions
- **Example for ethics**: Great example that although it is a duty to publish suo moto disclosure of the information but not many institution has done that especially for the RTI that people keep on filing again and again
- Still the government has not done the analysis of the kind of RTI they are getting and perhaps that sort of information can be suo disclosed

### Conflict Between Laws

- **Official Secret Act vs RTI**: Can create lot of conflict
- The act allows that information can be diverged if the disclosure in public interest outweighs the harm to the protected interest
- **Officer's discretion**: To judge whether public interest outweighs the harm of protected interest is of course a discretion of the officers
- Another example is Forest Right Act and PESA Act that can give conflicted directions

### Section 5.3 - Reasonable Assistance (07:20)

- **Key provision**: Every PIO should render reasonable assistance to the person who are seeking information
- **Open to interpretation**: Reasonable assistance is of course open to interpretation
- **Ethical standard**: A bureaucrat with dedication to public service will only interpret in the right fashion
- **Case study application**: Any case study dealing with RTI more often than not will have circumstances where reasonable assistance wouldn't have been provided

## RTI AS EFFECTIVE GRIEVANCE MECHANISM (08:37)

### Essential Ingredients of Grievance Redressal Mechanism

1. **Legal entitlements**: Any grievance mechanism that does not provide legal backing will not work
2. **Specific timelines**: For service delivery like 30 days and 48 hours if it is threat to life and liberty of the person
3. **Grievance redressal timelines**: Timeline for the redressal of the grievances also
4. **External mechanism**: To reduce the abuse of discretion, it provides external mechanism for reporting to Central or State Information Commission

### Timeline Provisions

| Type | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Normal RTI Response | 30 days |
| Life/Liberty Threat Cases | 48 hours |
| First Appeal | 30 days |
| Second Appeal | 90 days |

### Section 8 - Exemptions and Appeals

- **Copyright provisions**: Section 8 provides for copyright
- **First Appeal**: Section 19 provides timelines for first appeal - should be discharged within 30 days
- **Second Appeal**: Should be discharged within 90 days

## RTI PENALTIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY (11:22)

### Section 20 - Penalties on PIO

**Punishable offenses include:**
- Any reasonable cause refuse to receive an application
- Not furnishing information within the time specified
- Malifiedly denying the request for the information
- Knowingly given incorrect information
- Incomplete and misleading information
- Destroying of the information

**All these are intentional aspects** - they are punishable offenses

### Burden of Proof

- **Shifted burden**: The burden of proof that he acted reasonably and diligently shall be on the PIO officer
- **Not on citizen**: The burden of proof is shifted to the officer and not on the citizen

## RTI IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES (13:15)

### Infrastructure Challenges

- **Resource constraints**: Over 60% of the public authorities lack the necessary infrastructure and resource to actually manage the RTI application
- **Equipment needs**: You do not have enough inventory or the photography machine or the infrastructure that can support the RTI

### Human Resource Challenges

**Frequent Transfers:**
- Officers are often frequently transferred
- It is not the case that government separately recruits for the PIO and CPIO
- It is the usual officer public servants only they are given additional charges PIO and other things
- When they are frequently transferred, lack of capacity building will be there

**Training Deficits:**
- No proper training is provided
- Only 30% of the PIOs have actually received adequate training to the RTI act

**Information Commissioner Issues:**
- **Parking lot for civil servants**: Most of the post have been occupied by civil servants who have been routinely trained in maintaining the secrecy of the acts
- **Wrong appointments**: Instead of them the people who has interest, aptitude and experience in the transparency regimes they should be recruited
- **Recent amendments**: Have actually diluted the autonomy that is there at the hands of information commissioner
- **Headless commissions**: Often the post will be lying vacant only

### Enforcement Challenges

- **Weak penalties**: How weak penalties and deterrent mechanisms are there
- **High rejection rates**: Rejection rates are very very high - take the case of PMO, 90% rejection is there
- **Unreasoned rejections**: Almost 40% of all rejection did not invoke a valid reason to do so (CIC data)
- **Overburdening**: Over bundling of information commission because they are receiving so many information

### Utilization Challenges

**Awareness Issues:**
- People are not aware with respect to what are the entitlements they are having
- What are the legal provisions that are there

**Process Barriers:**
- Financial burden of RTI applicant because only in few cases the fees is actually waived
- Often complex application process is there
- Reasonable assistance people will not usually get in the government offices
- Lack of proper analysis of RTI application that has led to not so much of suo disclosure

**Other Issues:**
- Threat to the life of RTI activist
- **Misuse of RTI**: If the organization is receiving so much of frivolous RTI then it will lead to substantial diversion of the resources

| Challenge Category | Specific Issues |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Infrastructure | • Resource constraints (60% lack proper infrastructure)<br>• Equipment shortage<br>• Photography machines |
| Human Resource | • Frequent transfers<br>• Poor training (only 30% adequately trained)<br>• Civil servant parking lot<br>• Headless commissions |
| Enforcement | • Weak penalties<br>• High rejection rates (90% at PMO)<br>• Unreasoned rejections (40%)<br>• Overburdened commissions |
| Utilization | • Low awareness<br>• Financial burden<br>• Complex processes<br>• Threat to activists<br>• Misuse/frivolous applications |

## CASE STUDY: FRIVOLOUS RTI APPLICATIONS (23:15)

### Ethical Issues Identified

- **Respect for moral law**: Respect for law is not there
- **Rights without responsibility**: Defeating the very purpose of the act
- **Furthering vested interest**: Extortion from decision makers
- **Spillover effects**: On other RTI applicants - the information can be denied
- **Resource diversion**: Most importantly diversion of organizational resources
- **Transparency versus efficiency**: Ethical conflict
- **Right versus right**: Conflict situation

### Solutions and Options Analysis

**Committee-based Decision Making:**
- **Human element necessity**: Whatever option we take in terms of filtering frivolous and non-frivolous RTI application there has to be human element involved
- **Discretion abuse risk**: Whenever you are involving human element there will be discretion and that can be abused
- **Committee advantage**: Committee will take a decision instead of a single person in terms of screening applications

**External Accountability:**
- **Learning from RTI Act**: RTI provides external appeal mechanism to CIC and SIC because departmental people can be hand in glove with each other
- **External authority need**: There has to be some external authority which will check whether the decisions of the committee are compromised or not

### Second ARC Recommendations

**Refusal Criteria:**
- **PIO may refuse**: A request for information if it is **manifestly frivolous or vexatious**
- **Prior approval required**: Such refusal shall be communicated within 15 days of receipt and with the prior approval of the appellate authority
- **Dual approval**: The discretion is not of the PIO alone - it involves two people and the other person is senior to him

**Automatic Review:**
- **External transfer**: All such refusal shall stand transferred to CIC and SIC as the case may be
- **Automatic appeal**: Shall dispose the case as if it is an appeal under section 19
- **Accountability mechanism**: These people will always have that our decision will be transferred and there will be external accountability

**Resource Protection:**
- **Substantial diversion**: If the work involved would substantially and unreasonably divert the resources of the public body
- **Key terminology**: Words like "substantially", "unreasonably", "frivolous", "vexatious" are very important when giving such suggestions

### Ineffective Solutions

**Options to Avoid:**
- **Limiting applications**: Not a great democratic procedure
- **Increasing fees**: Creates economic inequality
- **Seeking purposes**: May deter genuine applications and the act does not require it
- **Affecting-party only**: Will kill the movement as RTI have been filed by public spirited NGOs

## NGO GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES (39:00)

### Fundamental Characteristics of NGOs

- **Not profit-driven**: The fundamental aspect of NGO is that they are not profit driven
- **Mission-based**: Every NGO is established for a mission and must declare its objective
- **Objective as rulebook**: Just as corporate governance is a rulebook for companies and constitution for government, NGO's objective is the rulebook by which the NGO should play

### Mission Statement Importance

**Accountability Framework:**
- Every functioning of the NGO will be judged from the perspective that whether it is fulfilling its objective or not
- An NGO involved in child education cannot be held accountable for not working in healthcare or sanitation
- **Legal requirement**: If an NGO receives fund for child care and utilizes that fund for public healthcare, it is actually a crime

**Donor Trust:**
- People donating to NGO are thinking that this NGO will be furthering the objective it had stated
- If NGO diverts resource to do something else then **it is cheating** and violation of trusteeships
- **Mission consistency**: Whatever funds NGOs are getting, the objective for which the NGOs formed should be upheld

### Core Ethical Principles for NGOs

**Autonomy and Independence:**
- **Autonomous nature**: Should be safeguarded - NGO should remain autonomous
- **Independence in working style**: Very important
- **Self-governing**: The governing body should be self-governing
- **Voluntary nature**: They are voluntary organization - cannot become extension of government department

**Financial Accountability:**
- **Donor accountability**: Duty to make donors realize that you are doing justice to their hard-earned money
- **Administrative expenses**: There has to be some limits and transparency on how funds are utilized
- **Fund utilization**: For whatever objective you have raised the fund, those objectives should be fulfilled

**Responsiveness:**
- **Participatory approach**: Should be responsive to whatever constituency it serves (children, women, etc.)
- **Community engagement**: Should not work in top-down fashion implementing something no longer desired by community
- **Responsive to needs**: It should become responsive to their needs

## NGO COLLABORATION PRINCIPLES (46:27)

### Decision-Making Criteria for Corporate Partnerships

**Primary Considerations:**
1. **Mission consistency**: Whether the alignment or collaboration will have mission consistency
2. **Shared values**: Should be there and help both parties
3. **Transparency**: Should be done in transparent fashion
4. **Independence preservation**: Should not compromise the independence
5. **Competitive advantage**: Should not have motivation of corporation to gain market advantage over competitor

**Critical Principle:**
- **NGO's mission first**: NGO should align with corporation only when it helps the NGO in achieving its own objective
- **Not for corporate benefit**: Not because it will confer any competitive advantage to that corporation
- **Mission statement paramount**: NGO's mission statement is the guiding principle NGO should follow, not any others' interest

### General Governance Principles

**Board and Leadership:**
- **Independent board**: Independent board of directors should be there that should not have any conflict of interest
- **Written policies**: Written policy of conflict of interest has to be part of governance (everything in NGO is informal)
- **Code of ethics**: Code of conduct and compliance with government regulations

**Transparency and Reporting:**
- **Annual reports**: Should present annual report with financial information
- **Source verification**: Sources of funds are important - NGO should not become euphemism to launder black money
- **Fund utilization breakdown**: How you are using funds - whether spending on administration or stated objective
- **Activity-specific funding**: Important that you utilize those fund for activity only for which donors have trusted

**Audit and Compliance:**
- **Independent audit**: If substantial, audit has to be done and accuracy shall be subject to independent and qualified accountant
- **FC guidelines**: Compliance with government regulation
- **Participatory approach**: With respect to the audience that you are serving

### Best Practice Example

**Transparency International:**
- Adhering to strict code of conduct
- Maintains independent board of director
- Regularly publishes detailed financial report
- Publishes corruption perception index
- Has strict code of conduct guidelines

## GOVERNMENT-NGO REGULATORY BALANCE (54:09)

### Issues from NGO Perspective

- **Regulatory inflexibility**: Government regulations are very difficult to follow
- **Clearance delays**: Not getting timely clearance
- **Compliance burden**: Need facilitation for compliance with regulations

### Solutions for Facilitation

**Process Improvements:**
- **Single window clearance**: For ease of NGO operations
- **Online applications**: Can be implemented
- **Sensitivity training**: For officials dealing with NGOs
- **Time-bound procedures**: For dealing with volunteer organization registration
- **Formal grievance system**: Should be established
- **Decentralized funding**: Lesser control at higher level, easier monitoring at lower level
- **Government policy portal**: Similar to NGO Darpan portal
- **Minimum consultation threshold**: Consultation required only for funds above certain amount (10 cr or 50 cr)

### Regulatory Content Reforms

**Independent Accreditation System:**
- **Independent agency**: Not affiliated with government so government does not exercise control
- **Certification system**: System of accreditation and certification for volunteer organizations
- **Standards-based rating**: Prescribe set of standards (financial returns, audit, external authority participation)
- **Rating categories**: A, B, C, D ratings based on compliance with standards
- **Market-driven accountability**: Donors can choose based on ratings, creating incentive for good practices

**Threshold-based Regulation:**
- **Income-based thresholds**: More stringent regulations beyond certain annual revenue
- **Progressive compliance**: Similar to labor law applicability based on employee numbers
- **Graduated approach**: Different regulation levels based on organization size/impact

**Central Law Framework:**
- **Unified legislation**: Can facilitate NGOs working in various states and abroad
- **Consistent standards**: Across different jurisdictions

### Government Organizational Balance Examples

**PSU Models:**
- **Navratna/Maharatna**: Government has graded various PSUs and allowed target-driven flexibility in decision making
- **Autonomous decision-making**: Can take certain decisions without consulting government

**MOU-based Accountability:**
- **Secretary-Minister MOU**: Second ARC recommendation that secretary can sign MOU with minister
- **Performance accountability**: Will have autonomy of decision-making and be accountable for performance in MOU contract
- **Contractual framework**: MOU as mechanism for ensuring accountability versus autonomy balance

## ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS CASE STUDY (67:24)

### Ethical Dilemmas in Development Projects

- **Economy versus environment**: Long-term versus short-term considerations
- **Sustainable development**: Balance between development needs and environmental protection

### Principles to Follow

**Environmental Ethics Principles:**
- **Precautionary principle**: If not sure of consequences or irreparable harm to environment, do not proceed
- **Ecocentric principle**: Considering ecosystem as whole
- **Justice principle**: Intergenerational equity
- **Sustainable development principle**: Meeting present needs without compromising future generations

### Course of Action

**EIA Process:**
- **Mandatory EIA**: Environmental Impact Assessment must be conducted
- **Community participation**: Adequate participation of people so it does not become lip service
- **Preliminary sharing**: Findings shared with community before submitting to higher authorities
- **Robust process**: More effective EIA process with accountability mechanisms

**Constitutional Framework:**
- **Article 48**: DPSP regarding environmental protection
- **Article 48A**: Environmental duties
- **Article 51**: Fundamental duties related to environment

## CONFLICT OF INTEREST CASE STUDY (71:05)

### PIO Dilemma Analysis

**Options Available:**
1. **Seek superior's advice**: Merit - expertise, experience, support in crisis; Demerit - dependency, guilt, ultimate responsibility remains yours
2. **Partial disclosure**: Wrong approach - integrity issue, legal offense under Section 19, violation of trust
3. **Full disclosure**: Even with full disclosure, conflict of interest perception remains

### Recommended Solution: Recusal

**Why Recusal is Best Option:**
- **Conflict of interest**: Facing immense conflict of interest
- **Natural justice**: No one can be the judge in his own case
- **Perception matters**: Justice should not only be done but should also seem to be done
- **Someone else decides**: Some other person should take decision and he should follow
- **Moral responsibility**: Shows courage and taking responsibility for actions
- **Bonafide nature**: Can hope authorities will consider bonafide nature of mistake

**Key Principles:**
- **Moral responsibility**: Taking ethical stand
- **Courage**: To do the right thing
- **Conflict of interest management**: Proper handling
- **Natural justice**: Fundamental principle
- **Perception importance**: Public perception of fairness

### Legal Framework

**Section 19 Violations:**
- **Incomplete information**: Legally punishable offense
- **Incorrect information**: Criminal nature
- **Malified intention**: Intentional misinformation
- **Misleading information**: Violation of act
