# Ethics Enrichment Class 13 - Answer Writing and Ethical Concepts

## INTRODUCTION AND ANSWER WRITING IMPORTANCE (00:00)

- Before beginning the class, the instructor asks how many students reviewed their answers after going home the previous day
- **Critical Issue Identified**: Most students do not review their own answers, which is a fundamental problem in answer writing
- **Core Problem**: What students think is in their head is not reflected on paper in the same spirit they wanted to convey
- This is one of the biggest mistakes among aspirants - inability to translate thoughts to paper effectively

### Why Answer Review is Essential

- **When to Review**: Go through answers when free from bias about your own responses, preferably the next day after writing
- **Not Immediately**: Don't review immediately after writing because everything is still fresh in your head
- **Fresh Perspective**: Allow your mind to be free when reviewing answers from an objective standpoint
- **Common Discoveries**: Students often find that thoughts were not communicated properly, certain points were irrelevant, or arguments didn't match the question's demand

### Major Answer Writing Mistakes

- **Irrelevance**: Writing points that don't match the subheading or question demand
- **Content Dumping**: Simply writing transparency, accountability without understanding what the question actually asks
- **Lack of Coherence**: Points written under particular subheadings don't match the intended argument

### Creating a Mistake Log

- **Essential Practice**: Maintain a separate page noting down all answer writing mistakes
- **Review Before Tests**: Go through this mistake log before attempting next tests
- **Fundamental Principle**: "What gets measured gets done" - until you acknowledge weaknesses, they will keep repeating
- **Key to Success**: The only difference between a topper and others is that toppers have minimized their mistakes through habitual action

## PERSONAL STORY AND LIFE LESSONS (04:00)

### 8th Class Board Examination Experience

### 10th Class Preparation and Mistake

- **Goal**: Determined to reach top 15 or top 10 in state to get name in newspaper

### Life Lessons Learned
