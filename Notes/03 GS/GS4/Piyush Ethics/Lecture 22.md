# Ethics Enrichment CLASS 22

## TECHNOLOGY ETHICS AND FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS (00:00)

### Introduction to Technology Ethics Case Study

- Today's case study focuses on **technological ethics** - a theme that has not been asked in UPSC context till now
- UPSC has asked **environmental ethics** from various perspectives (tribal, company violations, etc.) but not technological ethics specifically
- UPSC asked **media ethics** last year in case study format
- **Most likely context** for technological ethics will revolve around **public interest versus privacy**
- This is the most emergent theme in today's context and should be studied thoroughly

### Ethical Implications of Facial Recognition Technology

**Core Ethical Concerns:**

- **Article 21 and Right to Privacy**: Fundamental constitutional violation through mass surveillance
- **Potential discrimination and bias**: Algorithm-based discrimination leading to discriminatory policies and policing practices
  - Violation of **rule of law**
  - Violation of **equality before law** 
  - Violation of **principle of natural justice**
- **False positives and misidentification**: Innocent persons may be punished due to system errors
- **Erosion of civil liberties**: Mass surveillance creates a **surveillance state**
- **Chilling effect**: Supreme Court has repeatedly used this argument - may lead to self-censorship and restricted freedom exercise
- **Data theft and integrity issues**: Vulnerability to misuse by third parties
- **Liberty concerns**: Liberty is a core value in our Preamble and natural right as propagated by JOHN LOCKE
- **Overall impact on democracy**: Without transparency and accountability, potential for slippery slope

### Systematic Approach to Technology Implementation

**Step 1: Thorough and Independent Evaluation**
- Verify technological accuracy and potential for bias
- Assess chilling effect on privacy and civil liberties
- Similar to **EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment)** for development projects

**Step 2: Public Consultation and Dialogue**
- Communicate potential benefits and ethical concerns
- Invite diverse range of perspectives
- Ensure implementation is informed by public opinion and ethical concerns
- Build **participative governance**

**Step 3: Risk Minimization Measures**
- **Prioritized and limited use**: Specific high-risk areas only, not mass surveillance
- **Regulations and safeguards**: Apply principles from **GDPR**
  - Data minimization
  - Confidentiality and accuracy
  - Legal basis for data processing

**Step 4: Accountability Mechanisms**
- **Robust grievance redressal mechanism**: For wrongly identified individuals
- **Independent regular audits**: Involve retired judges or independent oversight
- **Transparency reports**: Publish findings to extent possible

### Justification Framework

**Ethical Principles Supporting Implementation:**

- **Duty to ensure law and order**: Constitutional and professional obligation
- **Utilitarian approach**: Benefit to greatest number of people
- **Social contract theory**: Allows reasonable restrictions as per Constitution
- **Beneficence**: Benefits must outweigh harm
- **Autonomy**: Right to privacy ensured by minimizing data use
- **Justice**: Adequate steps to prevent discrimination against marginalized groups

## RESCUE OPERATIONS AND CRISIS LEADERSHIP (27:00)

### Case Study Context: Disaster Response Challenges

**Situation Analysis:**
- People rendered homeless, deprived of food, drinking water, amenities
- Rescue work disrupted, local population angry
- Team members assaulted and injured
- Calls to abandon operations from team members

### Why Abandoning Operations is Not an Option

**Core Arguments Against Withdrawal:**

- **Duty-based ethics**: Constitutional and professional obligation cannot be abandoned
- **Virtue ethics**: Character demands perseverance in crisis
- **Consequentialist concerns**: Will lead to **trust and credibility crisis**
- **Further alienation**: People already alienated; stopping operations increases alienation
- **Universal law principle**: Administration cannot abandon people during crisis

### Crisis Management Strategy

**Immediate Response - Diffusing Tension:**

1. **Address public anger through transparency**
   - Explain actual reasons for delayed response
   - Disclose circumstances beyond administrative control

2. **Ensure team safety as leadership priority**
   - Two approaches available:
     a. **Legal accountability**: Hold guilty parties accountable for obstructing public servants
