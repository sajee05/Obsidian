## Attitude: Definition and Core Understanding (0:29)

### Basic Definition
- **Attitude**: Predisposition to act in a certain fashion
- **Mental tendency** that guides behavior
- Broader concept than beliefs - attitude encompasses cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects

### Relationship with Beliefs and Values

| Concept | Definition | Scope | Example |
|---------|------------|-------|---------|
| **Beliefs** | Own convictions and assumptions (may or may not be true) | Narrow - informative/cognitive aspect only | "Snakes are dangerous" (though 70% are non-venomous) |
| **Attitude** | Predisposition with cognitive, affective, and behavioral components | Broader than beliefs | Positive/negative attitude toward iPhone |
| **Values** | Preferences and priorities considered valuable | Broadest - foundational principles | Honesty, spirituality, loyalty |

## CAB Model of Attitude (0:52)

### Three Components of Attitude

#### 1. Cognitive Component
- **Beliefs and assumptions** about attitudinal object
- What we think about something
- Example: "Snakes are dangerous" belief despite facts:
  - 70% of snakes are non-venomous
  - 70% of snake bites are dry bites (no venom injection)
  - Actual chance of venomous bite is very low

#### 2. Affective Component  
- **Emotional response** to attitudinal object
- How we feel about something
- Examples:
  - Fear when seeing snake
  - Positive emotions toward chocolate or ice cream
  - Pleasant/unpleasant feelings

#### 3. Behavioral Component
- **Tendency to act** in certain way
- What we do in response
- Examples:
  - Running away from snake
  - Pessimistic people running from problems
  - Thief running from police

### Component Interactions and Dominance

#### Alignment vs. Misalignment
- **When aligned**: Behavior more likely to follow attitude
- **When misaligned**: Difficulty in consistent behavior
- Example: Medicine taking
  - Cognitive: "Medicine is important"
  - Affective: Unpleasant taste (negative feeling)
  - Behavioral: Still take medicine (cognitive dominance)

#### Factors Determining Component Dominance
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Without EI, affective component overpowers reasoning
- **Task Importance**: Higher importance leads to cognitive dominance
- **Past Experience**: Previous behavioral outcomes influence current attitudes

### Attitude Examples with Component Analysis

| Situation | Cognitive | Affective | Behavioral | Dominant Component |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Fast food consumption | "Bad for health" | Pleasure, enjoyment | Continue eating | Affective |
| UPSC preparation | "Hard work needed" | Resistance, difficulty | Continue studying | Cognitive |
| Car purchase | Cost-benefit analysis | Desire | Research and compare | Cognitive |

## Formation of Attitude (0:26)

### Primary Sources of Attitude Development

#### 1. Sensory Reactions
- **Through senses** we understand and organize outside world
- Children's response to bright colors, mobile phones
- First encounters with fire, danger
- **Sensory experiences** shape initial attitudes

#### 2. Value System Influence
- **Existing preferences** guide attitude toward new objects
- Spiritual vs. materialistic value systems
- Values act as **filter** for new attitude formation

#### 3. Observation Learning
- **Learning from others' behavior** without direct instruction
- Examples:
  - Parents breaking rules, offering bribes
  - Electricity theft in villages (jumper/tanka connections)
  - Children learning from family demonstrations
- **Setting precedent** importance in organizations

#### 4. Evaluative Learning
- **Personal association** with experiences
- Relationship examples:
  - Romantic songs gaining meaning during relationship
  - Sad songs during breakup
- **Personal exposure** creates meaning and attitude

#### 5. Mere Exposure Effect
- **Repeated exposure** leads to positive attitude development
- Examples:
  - Green tea, black coffee (bitter taste becomes acceptable)
  - Family relationships
- **Time factor** important for this effect

#### 6. Direct Personal Experience
- **First-hand involvement** in activities
- COVID example: Male participation in household work
- **Role-playing methods** for understanding perspectives
- Direct experience provides complete understanding

#### 7. Self-Perception and Introspection
- **Life events** leading to attitude change
- Historical examples:
  - ASHOKA after Kalinga War
  - VALMIKI RISHI transformation
  - MAJID NAWAZ change
- **Failure experiences** leading to renewed commitment

#### 8. Operant Conditioning

### Cognitive Dissonance and Attitude Change

#### Definition and Mechanism

- **Greater magnitude** of conflict = stronger dissonance
- People **seek alignment** between thoughts, feelings, and behavior

#### Coping Strategies
1. **Change Behavior**: Align actions with beliefs
2. **Change Cognitions**: Modify beliefs to match behavior  
3. **Justify Behavior**: Rationalize current actions
