# Ethics Enrichment Class 10: Ethical Issues in Public and Private Institutions

## DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS (00:11)

- **Context**: Important to understand differences because case studies will come from both private sector and public sector contexts
- **Relevance**: Expected ethical obligations differ between private and public sectors

### Comparison of Public vs Private Organizations

| Aspect | Public Organizations | Private Organizations |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Motive** | Public interest (touchstone of ethical decision making) | Profit making and survival |
| **Outlook** | Citizens with rights and entitlements due to citizenship and social contract | Customers - can distinguish between those who can pay vs cannot pay |
| **Legal Framework** | Much more rigid application of laws, many rules governing decision making | Less stringent legal applications, more flexibility |
| **Accountability** | Towards citizens of the country | Towards shareholders first, then other stakeholders |
| **Political Direction** | Act in political context, need political feasibility | Can make decisions that may offend sections of society |
| **Scope of Action** | Far bigger scope, existence of private sector decided by state | Limited scope compared to government |
| **Social Consequences** | Much broader impact on millions of lives | Significant but generally narrower impact |
| **Financial Control** | Tightly controlled by legislature, parliamentary committees, audits | More autonomous financial decision making |
| **Monopoly** | Has monopoly over violence, law and order, external affairs | No such monopolistic powers |

### Core Values Differences

**Public Administration Values:**
- Uniformity of treatment
- Compassion
- Social justice  
- Accountability to public
- Non-partisanship

**Private Organization Values:**
- Efficiency
- Economy
- Effectiveness
- Profit maximization

### Modern Convergence Trends

- **Public organizations adopting private values**: Mini ratna, Navratna companies have profit targets and turnover requirements
- **Private organizations adopting public values**: CSR initiatives showing concern for society
- **Reason**: Difficult to function in isolation - government organizations cannot survive being inefficient, private organizations cannot survive without being considerate to society

## WHY FOLLOW ETHICS IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (17:09)

### Fundamental Arguments

**1. Trustee Relationship**
- Public administrators act as trustees of resources belonging to the people
- Resources do not belong to bureaucrats but to people of the country
- Requires depersonalization and neutrality
- Must not have personal interests

**2. Large Scale Impact**
- Example: If you are lazy, you ruin only your life, but if an SP becomes lazy, millions of lives are ruined
- Any decision making has huge impact requiring utmost caution
- Responsibility for both actions and omissions (stampede deaths, bridge collapses, railway accidents)

**3. Huge Discretionary Power**
- Not possible to write every decision in black and white
- Laws have "reasonable restrictions" requiring discretionary judgment
- Discretion utilization depends on value system
- Examples: 
  - Section 3D of Patent Act preventing evergreening
  - Section 144, sedition cases
- Power comes with responsibility under social contract

**4. Social Capital Development**
- Cultivate shared networks and relationships with citizens
- Cannot achieve great governance results without taking people along
- Examples: Insurgency resolution requires "willing heart and mind approach"
- People participation requires social capital

**5. Constitutional Morality**
- Following constitution's requirements as welfare state
- Promoting political, economic and social justice
- Liberty, equality, fraternity for everyone
- Principles applicable only when we are ethical

**6. Ethics Promotes Efficiency**
- Contrary to belief that ethics and efficiency don't go hand in hand
- Examples:
  - Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) requiring innovation
  - Ease of doing business promotion
  - If speed money becomes universal, it disturbs level playing field and market economy

**7. Enhancement of Soft Power**
- Trust and moral standing in international relations
- Examples:
  - Non-aligned movement success
  - India's role in Korean War under General Thimayya
  - NSG waivers due to responsible nuclear behavior
  - MTCR regime membership
- Contrast with China's debt-driven diplomacy problems

## DETERMINANTS OF ETHICS IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (30:22)

### Historical Factors
- **Colonial legacy**: Impact of British administrative practices
- **Mughal influence**: Bakshi system and other historical administrative practices

### Social and Cultural Factors
- **Family values**: Impact of materialistic orientations
- **End justifies means approach**: Makes it difficult to learn ethical behavior
- **Societal expectations**: Example of collector families demanding dowry

### Judicial Factors
- **Dependency of cases**: Legal system complexities
- **Pending cases**: Work culture issues
- **Political facilities**: Dilution of processes

### Institutional Factors
- **Working conditions**: Pay scales and economic factors
- **Organizational culture**: Impact on ethical behavior

## STATUS OF ETHICS IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (32:42)

### Current Problems (Dysfunction of Bureaucracy)
- **Favoritism and nepotism**
- **Hierarchy and arrogance**
- **Closed system mentality**
- **Corruption and lack of impartiality**
- **Rule of law violations**
- **Abuse of power**
- **Lack of coordination**: Segmented approach due to division of labor
- **Rigid adherence to procedures**: Hiding behind rules and regulations

## ETHICAL DILEMMAS (34:01)

### Definition and Characteristics
- **Precondition**: Dilemma between two moral alternatives (not between moral and immoral)
- **Requirement**: Both options must have at least one moral argument
- **Distinction from Ethical Issues**: 
  - Ethical issues involve violation of ethical principles (may or may not involve dilemma)
  - Ethical dilemmas involve competing moral claims

### Example Illustration
**Scenario A (Ethical Issue)**: Taking 1 crore bribe and giving tender - pure greed, no dilemma
**Scenario B (Ethical Dilemma)**: Gun to head, forced to take bribe - conflict between public duty and personal safety

### Why Many Dilemmas in Government Organizations
- **Multiple competing interests**: Family, environment, finance, agriculture, farmers, consumers, regulatory bodies, private companies
- **Huge discretionary power**: Creates opportunities for dilemmatic situations
- **Diverse set of values**: Accountability vs efficiency often in conflict

### Types of Dilemmas (Examples)
- **Personal vs Professional**: Young SP taking on sand mafia while family threatened
- **Conflicting responsibilities**: Efficiency vs accountability
- **Oath of secrecy vs transparency**
- **Public interest vs right to privacy**: Government surveillance vs privacy rights
- **Merit vs reservation**: Non-discrimination vs affirmative action

## CONFLICT OF INTEREST (45:54)

### Types of Conflict of Interest

**1. Actual Conflict of Interest**
- Direct ownership in company participating in auction you're managing
- Being chairman of recruitment board where your son is appearing

**2. Potential Conflict of Interest**
- Finance secretary becoming CAG and examining own tenure's expenditure

**3. Perceived Conflict of Interest**
- People may perceive conflict even without direct involvement
- Example: Recruitment where someone from your village/community appears
- Depends on perception rather than actual conflict

### Key Principles
- **Caesar's wife must be above suspicion**
- **Justice should not only be done but should also be seen to be done**
- Perception matters as much as reality for maintaining trust

### Six Ways of Resolving Conflict of Interest

**1. Disclosure**
- Simply informing about the conflict of interest
- Others can judge whether you're acting objectively
- Sufficient when transparency can maintain fairness

**2. Restricting Involvement**
- Limiting your participation in conflicted matters
- Example: Not asking questions to your son in interview, letting others handle

**3. Third Party Oversight**
- Recruiting external party to oversee entire process
- Examples:
  - Election observers from outside state
  - External audits by CAG
  - NHRC monitoring police investigations
  - Judicial committees monitoring investigations

**4. Removing from Involvement Altogether**
- Complete withdrawal from process
- Example: Not sitting as chairman when son appears in examination
- Judges recusing themselves from cases

**5. Relinquishing Personal/Private Interest**
- Asking family members not to participate in processes you manage
- Example: Brother not participating in tender you're managing

**6. Resignation (Last Resort)**
- When conflict cannot be resolved through other means

### Importance of Resolving Conflict of Interest
- **Trust maintenance**: Most important aspect
- **Sanctity of process**: Organizational integrity must be maintained
- **Example**: If UPSC chairman's son topped examination, even if fair, public perception would question UPSC's sanctity
- **Guidelines**: Teachers don't supervise board exams when their children are appearing

## ETHICAL CONCERNS IN PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS (60:03)

### Common Issues

**At Employer Level:**
- **Favoritism and nepotism**: More common than in government organizations
- **Monopolistic tendencies**: Anti-competitive practices, deep discounts
- **Sexual harassment**: Couch casting allegations, #MeToo cases
- **Gender discrimination**: Pay gap, glass ceiling, limited women in upper management
- **Disability and caste discrimination**
- **Regional discrimination**: Checks not present as in public organizations

**Employee Related:**
- **Unequal remuneration**
- **Hire and fire culture**: Mass layoffs in tech companies and startups
- **Instrumental value of workers**: Reflecting crony capitalism
- **Moonlighting**: Working for multiple organizations without disclosure

**Customer Related:**
- **Misleading advertisements**
- **CSR as publicity**: Not genuine social responsibility
- **Commodification of data**: Selling personal information (Facebook example)

**General Corporate Issues:**

## LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS (63:46)

### Distinctions

| Aspect | Laws | Rules | Regulations |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Framework** | Skeleton framework | Detailed framework | Specific context |
| **Made by** | Legislature/Parliament | Executive/Bureaucracy | Executive |
| **Purpose** | Broad macro perspective | Implementation details | Fill legal vacuum |
| **Enforceability** | Most stringent | Moderate | Least among three |
| **Flexibility** | Less flexible | More flexible | Most flexible |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Law always wins | Subordinate to laws | Subordinate to laws |

### Why Rules Exist (Delegated Legislation)
- **Parliament limitations**: No time for detailed laws, lacks specific expertise
- **Bureaucratic expertise**: Better understanding of implementation requirements
- **Flexibility needs**: Easy to change rules without legislative approval
- **Example**: COVID zones (green, orange, red) changed through rules, not laws

### Problems in Interface
- **Rules violating act spirit**: Sometimes bureaucracy defeats purpose of law
- **Limited oversight**: Only 1% of rules examined by parliamentary committee
- **Capacity constraints**: Committee cannot examine all rules

## LAWS AS SOURCE OF ETHICAL GUIDANCE (73:58)

### How Laws Help in Ethical Decision Making

**1. Codification of Societal Morality**
- Laws reflect collective will of society
- Example: Criminal law amendments after Nirbhaya case
- Protection of Women from Sexual Harassment Act with broad workplace definition

**2. Provides Legitimacy**
- Passed through legitimate democratic process
- Removes subjectivity - cannot deny based on personal beliefs
- Acceptance becomes mandatory under rule of law

**3. Acts as Arbitrator**
- Resolves conflicts between social customs and legal requirements
- Examples: Triple talaq, child marriage, dowry practices
- Law prevails over customs in conflicts

**4. External Source of Ethics**
- Sometimes law initiates change rather than following it
- Example: CSR imposition on private sector
- Independent media regulator demands

**5. Promotes Public Interest**
- Helps see beyond individual perspective
- Example: Lockdown restrictions for collective welfare despite individual losses
- Reasonable restrictions for public order, national security

**6. Operant Conditioning**
- Punishment and reward system shapes behavior
- Understanding right and wrong through consequences

**7. Character Development**
- Attitudes shaped by legal framework
- Extension of operant conditioning principle

**8. Understanding Social Justice**
- Constitutional law provides universal voting rights
- Reservations and resource distribution mechanisms
- Welfare state principles

### Examples of Ethical Guidance

- **Forest Rights Act and PESA**: Tribal entitlements and development conflicts
- **Constitutional values**: Administrator dealing with tribal vs development conflicts

## LIMITATIONS OF LAWS AS ETHICAL SOURCE (84:50)

### Major Limitations

**1. Minimum Morality Only**
- Law provides baseline, not maximum ethical standards
- Should strive for maximizing morality in society
- Example: Right to healthcare should be fundamental right but isn't legally mandated

**2. Not Illegal but Unethical Situations**
- Marital rape example - not illegal but unethical
- Guided by conscience and respect for moral law, not legal consequences
- People dying on roadside - no legal obligation to help but ethical obligation exists

**3. Enforcement Issues**
- Laws exist but enforcement lacking
- Example: Dowry laws exist but dowry still rampant
- Dysfunctional criminal justice system
- Access to justice inequality between rich and poor
- Operant conditioning doesn't work without enforcement

**4. Laws Not Exhaustive**
- Cannot cover every circumstance
- Require interpretation and discretionary judgment
- Examples: Plastic pollution laws came recently, animal rights not fully developed
- Discretion in EIA, SIA, patent extensions

**5. Loopholes and Conflicts**
- People utilize loopholes (transfer pricing for tax avoidance)
- Tax avoidance vs tax planning distinctions
- Conflicts between different laws and regulations
- Example: Forest management committee vs Gram Sabha rights

**6. Coercive Nature**
- Coercion not effective for behavioral change
- Need internalization rather than external pressure
- Negative perception towards law reduces effectiveness
- Cultural evils persist despite laws (dowry, child marriage)

**7. Process and Content Issues**
- Undemocratic law-making processes lose legitimacy
- Examples: Foreign laws, insurgent areas where people feel unrepresented
- Unjust laws like salt law during colonial period

**8. Law vs Morality Conflicts**
- Some laws may violate morality for some people
- Example: Abortion laws vs doctor's duty to save life

## CONSCIENCE AS SOURCE OF ETHICAL GUIDANCE (96:07)

### Definition and Characteristics
- **Intrinsic intuitive capacity**: Cognitive act of mind, not emotional response
- **Shaped by**: Value system, culture, norms, experiences, morals
- **Development**: Over time through law, common sense, experience, society
- **Nature**: First responder in emergency and crisis situations

### How Conscience Helps

**1. First Responder**
- Emergency situations without access to legal precedent
- Example: COVID-19 initial response, remote district posting with lost communication
- Can make ethical decisions by listening to conscience

**2. Internal Motivation**
- Avoid crisis of conscience (guilt from not following ethical beliefs)
- Intrinsic force to make ethical decisions
- Contrast with external coercive aspect of law

**3. Resolving Ethical Dilemmas**
- Helps choose between moral alternatives
- Example: Oath secrecy vs whistleblowing - conscience guides decision
- Soldiers choosing duty over personal safety to avoid regret

**4. Enforcement of Law in Letter and Spirit**
- Difference between procedural compliance and meaningful implementation
- Example: Rape complaint filing - spirit vs letter of law
- Dedication to public service beyond rule-following

**5. Legal Vacuum Situations**
- Staying ethical when no specific laws exist
- Example: Marital rape, discretionary decisions
- Premchand's story of Panch maintaining impartiality despite personal relationships

**6. High Standards of Integrity**
- Not driven by external monitoring
- High sense of morality independent of punishment fear
- Link to concept of Yoga - excellence without external push

**7. Personal Accountability**
- Taking responsibility for actions and omissions
- Consistent character development through reasoning

**8. Resisting Unethical Pressures**
- Handling transfers and hardships
- Conscientiousness keeps one going despite pressures

### Political and Legal Reform Role
- Sometimes individual conscience leads to legal/ethical reforms
- Examples: Sati, triple talaq reforms
- Conscience can be ahead of law and politics

## LIMITATIONS OF CONSCIENCE (107:55)

### Major Limitations

**1. Subjectivity**
- Each person's conscience developed by unique experiences and cultural norms
- Example: Patriarchal upbringing may not make conscience pick on women's subjugation
- Cultural relativism in practices like female genital mutilation

**2. Lack of Clarity**
- May not provide clear direction in complex dilemmas
- Example: Arjuna's confusion in Mahabharata facing relatives in war
- Cannot always prioritize one principle over another

**3. Cognitive Dissonance**
- People avoid crisis of conscience by changing cognition
- Example: Avoiding guilt about not doing answer writing by rationalizing "toppers did it in last month only"
- Reducing guilt rather than allowing conscience to guide

**4. External Pressure and Group Think**
- Even when conscience says something is wrong, external pressure may prevent action
- Lack of courage to act on conscience
- Example: Government office corruption - people notice but don't become whistleblowers

**5. Cultural and Experiential Limitations**
- Limited exposure leads to limited moral understanding
- Example: Jihadi terrorists believing they're doing religious duty
- Honor killing parents showing no remorse
- Conscience shaped by narrow cultural context

**6. Need for Continuous Training**
- Conscience requires ongoing development and refinement
- Cannot rely solely on conscience without moral education

## KEY CONCEPTS AND DISTINCTIONS (115:11)

### Cognitive Dissonance vs Ethical Dilemma vs Crisis of Conscience

| Concept | Definition | Characteristics |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Cognitive Dissonance** | Incongruence between cognitions, emotions, and behavior | May not involve moral conflict, causes mental discomfort |
| **Ethical Dilemma** | Choice between two moral alternatives | Both options have moral arguments, moral conflict present |
| **Crisis of Conscience** | Strong guilt from not following ethical beliefs | Always involves morality, strong remorse and guilt, often after act committed |
