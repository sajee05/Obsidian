# Ethics Enrichment CLASS 08: Moral Thinkers and Schools of Ethical Thought

## Introduction to Moral Thinkers (00:00)

- **Context Setting**: Previous discussion on attitude and strategies for changing attitudes, political attitude, and various components of attitude
- **Information and Attitude Relationship**: Information shapes attitude through the cognitive aspect of attitude
- **Effective Component**: Emotional overtone that influences our attitude
- **Application Focus**: Expected questions will be in applied manner only, linking with temperance and emotional intelligence

### Approach to Learning Moral Thinkers

- **Primary Objective**: Understanding basic ideas and principles for application in case studies and Section A answers
- **Important Warning**: Do not try to become philosopher in this particular topic - focus on application part only
- **Central Theme**: All approaches tell you what should be the right action (normative school of thoughts)

## Schools of Ethical Thought Overview (04:17)

### Three Major Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Key Characteristic |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Deontological Perspective** | Actions themselves (means) | Focuses on the action itself, what means you take to achieve any end |
| **Teleological Perspective** | Consequences of actions (ends) | Decides based on consequences - whether action leads to greatest happiness for all people |
| **Virtue Approach** | Actor's character | Focuses on people taking decisions - "what kind of person I want to become" |

- **Action vs Actor Distinction**: First two focus on actions, virtue ethics focuses on personality traits and actors themselves
- **Character Traits in Virtue Ethics**: Be brave, be courageous - all traits of character that someone would like to become

## Deontological Ethics - EMANUEL KANT (07:07)

### Basic Assumptions and Arguments

#### The Good Will Principle
- **Fundamental Assertion**: "Nothing can possibly be conceived in the world or even out of it which can be called good without qualification except a good will"
- **Only Thing Fundamentally Good**: Good will is the only thing that is fundamentally good in itself
- **Conditional Goods Examples**:
  - **Health**: Healthy people can harm others, beat people - not fundamentally good
  - **Courage**: Thieves are also courageous when entering houses despite fear of being caught
  - **Wealth**: Rich people can misuse their wealth

#### Definition of Good Will
- **Good Will Flows From**: Freedom and respect for the moral law
- **Two Essential Components**:
  1. **Free Will**: Must be absolutely free from compulsions
  2. **Respect for Moral Law**: Acting for sake of moral law, not external rewards

### Free Will Requirements (11:02)

#### Freedom from Compulsions
- **External Coercion**: Not being forced by someone
- **Internal Control**: Not being under control of desires, senses, or appetites
- **Examples of Non-Free States**:
  - Being hungry (no control over hunger)
  - Alcohol addiction
  - Gambling addiction
  - Physical desires controlling behavior

#### Implications for Ethics
- **Mitigating Circumstances**: When someone is not free, they are proportionately less guilty
- **Current Applications**: Emotionally charged people acting under desires, natural urges

### Respect for Moral Law (14:39)

#### Intention-Focused Ethics
- **Primary Requirement**: Acting for sake of respect for moral law, not external benefits
- **Charity Example**: Doing charity and posting on social media - intention is self-benefit, not moral law
- **Examination Integrity**: Not copying because you respect principle of fair examination vs. not copying because no opportunity

#### Beyond Compassion and Love
- **KANT's Controversial Position**: Even compassion and empathy cannot guarantee ethical decisions
- **Family Examples**: Parents committing mistakes due to love and compassion for children
- **Recent Case Reference**: Pune teenager incident - parents helping child avoid jail despite moral law violations

### Categorical Imperative Framework (21:00)

#### Types of Commands
- **Conditional/Hypothetical Imperative**: "Do not smoke because it causes cancer" - depends on conditions
- **Categorical Imperative**: Unconditional commands that apply universally

#### Reasoning Behind Categorical Nature
- **Universal Free Will**: If all people have free will, devoid of self-interest and external constraints
- **Rational Equality**: All rational human beings would reach same moral decisions
- **No Individual Differences**: Without external constraints, no difference between individuals

### Three Principles of Moral Law (26:29)

#### 1. Universality Principle
- **Universal Application**: Whatever law we make must be applicable to all universally
- **No Situational Ethics**: Cannot be contingent upon circumstances
- **Contradiction Test**: If making conditional law universal creates contradictions, it's wrong

##### Examples of Contradictions
- **Lying Example**: If everyone lies universally, no one would believe anyone - lying becomes impossible
- **Cheating Example**: If everyone cheats in examination, grades lose meaning and relevance

#### 2. Human Dignity Principle (40:22)
- **Treat Humans as Ends**: "Act in such a way that you treat human beings as an end in themselves and not merely as a means"
- **Reasoning Faculty Respect**: Human beings have reasoning faculties, deserve dignity
- **Examples of Treating Humans as Means**:
  - Manual scavenging
  - Uninformed clinical trials
  - Bonded labor
  - Human trafficking
  - Misleading advertisements

#### 3. Reciprocity Principle (46:59)
- **Legislator and Subject**: Act as both legislator making laws and someone following those laws
- **Personal Application**: Whatever law I make, I should be willing to be subjected to same laws
- **Example**: Would you expect same treatment if you were the old lady without ration card?

### Practical Applications (48:22)

#### Case Study Applications
- **Fake Encounters**: Cannot become universal law - creates slippery slope, prevents due process
- **Exception-Making**: When creating exceptions in case studies, cite KANT's universality argument
- **Child Labor Cases**: Humans being treated as means to someone's end
- **Corporate Unethical Practices**: Treating human beings as means to profitable ends

#### Merits of KANT's Ethics (70:19)
- **Ethical Absolutism**: Universal standards by virtue of human existence
- **Easy to Follow**: Equal rules for everyone, no constant evaluation needed
- **Avoids Slippery Slope**: No conditionality prevents gradual erosion
- **Based on Rationality**: Founded on reasoning rather than divine command

#### Criticisms (72:02)
- **Consequence Ignorance**: Cannot hide behind rules when consequences matter
- **Welfare State Responsibility**: PDS officer example - responsibility when old lady dies
- **Truth-Telling Dilemma**: Telling truth to terminally ill person causing death
- **Universal Law Difficulty**: Not easy to arrive at universal laws
- **Diversity Ignorance**: Ignores that people may prefer different things

## Teleological Ethics (74:41)

### Core Principle
- **Consequence-Based**: Decides ethicality of action based on consequences
- **Greatest Happiness Principle**: Action is good if it produces maximum happiness for maximum number of people

### Applications
- **Land Acquisition Justification**: Depriving private property justified by electricity, employment, GDP benefits
- **Freedom of Speech Restrictions**: Liberty of some restricted so others can enjoy their liberty
- **Public Order Measures**: Curfews, Section 144 imposed for larger good

### JEREMY BENTHAM - Quantitative Utilitarianism (77:05)

#### Basic Philosophy
- **Two Sovereign Masters**: "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure"
- **Utility Definition**: Action has utility if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain
- **Quantification Belief**: Pleasure and pain can be quantified and calculated

#### Felicific Calculus Parameters
- **Intensity**: How intense the pleasure is
- **Duration**: How long the pleasure lasts
- **Certainty**: Probability of pleasure occurring
- **Purity**: Whether pleasure is followed by pain
- **Extent**: Number of people affected

#### No Qualitative Difference
- **Equal Pleasure Principle**: No qualitative difference between different types of pleasure
- **Examples**: Reading book vs. drinking alcohol vs. eating vs. sleeping - all equal if quantitatively same

#### Four Sanctions System (83:37)
- **Natural Sanctions**: Fear of death, health complications
- **Political Sanctions**: Laws, police, punishment
- **Social Sanctions**: Social boycott, disapproval
- **Religious Sanctions**: Fear of God

### JOHN STUART MILL - Qualitative Utilitarianism (86:38)

#### Key Departure from BENTHAM
- **Qualitative Differences**: There are qualitative differences in different sorts of pleasures
- **Superior Pleasures**: Spiritual and intellectual pleasures are superior to sensual/bodily pleasures
- **Competent Judge**: Person who has experienced both will prefer intellectual pleasure

#### Famous Quote
- **"Better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied"**: Human has natural sense of dignity to test quality of pleasure
- **Higher Order Pursuit**: Better to remain dissatisfied pursuing higher pleasure than satisfied with lower pleasures

#### Additional Sanction
- **Conscience**: Added conscience as fifth sanction - will prick if not following higher order pleasures
- **Natural Dignity**: Everyone has natural sense of dignity

#### Applications
- **Delayed Gratification**: Athletes following strict regime, students studying instead of partying
- **Policy Distinctions**: Freebies (lower pleasures) vs. education/health subsidies (higher pleasures)

### Act vs Rule Utilitarianism (95:00)

| Type | Decision Method | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Act Utilitarianism** | Case-by-case basis for each action | ROBIN HOOD deciding to rob based on individual case benefit |
| **Rule Utilitarianism** | Follow rules that lead to greatest happiness | EIA and SIA standard process for all land acquisitions |

#### Government Applications
- **Rule Utilitarian Examples**: Section 144 guidelines, Article 19 reasonable restrictions
- **Act Utilitarian Examples**: Individual discretion in PDS scheme cases

### Other Utilitarian Variants (101:11)

#### Ethical Egoism
- **Principle**: Action is ethical if it maximizes self-interest
- **Reasoning**: Society is collection of individuals - taking care of individuals automatically ensures collective well-being
- **Important Applications**:
  - **Women's Rights**: Challenging sacrifice-based expectations
  - **Tribal Rights**: 70% of developmental displaced persons are tribals
  - **Mental Health**: Individual right to mental health often ignored for "greater good"

#### Ethical Altruism (109:27)
- **Principle**: Action is ethical if it produces benefit for others, not for self
- **Examples**: MOTHER TERESA and other compassionate lives
- **Criticism**: Based on "mysticism" - difficult to believe people act purely for others
- **Danger**: State enforcing this moral ideal to justify taking rights

### Merits of Utilitarianism (111:03)
- **Result-Oriented**: Focuses on consequences that people ultimately care about
- **Flexible**: Allows case-by-case decisions considering context and diversity
- **Moral Democracy**: Like democracy - greatest number of people benefited
- **Avoids Conflicting Rules**: Broader perspective helps resolve conflicts between different ministries/departments

### Criticisms of Utilitarianism (115:12)
- **Distribution Problem**: Talks about total happiness, not distribution of happiness
- **Human Rights Violations**: Might lead to violation of human rights of some people
- **Different Perceptions**: People have different perceptions of happiness
- **Measurement Difficulty**: Difficult to measure and compare different types of happiness
- **Slippery Slope**: Flexibility might lead to abuse (President's Rule example, sedition cases, censorship)

## Virtue Ethics - SOCRATES (122:02)

### Core Philosophy
- **Character Focus**: Action is virtuous if it helps in making a virtuous person
- **Habitual Action**: Virtues are result of habitual action
- **Decision Framework**: "What kind of person I want to become?"

### Application Examples
- **Daily Discipline**: To be disciplined person, practice discipline daily
- **Transfer Avoidance**: Not seeking transfer to avoid becoming coward
- **Historical Examples**: Freedom fighters concerned about how history will remember them

### Common Greek Philosophy Assumptions (126:21)

#### Knowledge Supremacy
- **Only Thing Good**: Knowledge
- **Only Thing Evil**: Ignorance
- **Knowledgeable Person**: Can do nothing wrong
- **Wrong Actions**: Result from not understanding implications and consequences

#### SOCRATES' Dialectic Method (128:24)
- **Process**: Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis
- **Reflection and Questioning**: Engage in debate, dialogue, reasoning, critical perspective
- **Continuous Process**: Keep debating until arriving at true knowledge

##### Example: GDP Growth vs Environment
- **Thesis**: High GDP growth is required
- **Antithesis**: High GDP growth leads to environmental degradation
- **Synthesis**: Do EIA and SIA, ensure no irreparable ecological damage while pursuing growth

##### Example: Science and Technology
- **Thesis**: Science and technology is panacea for growth and development
- **Antithesis**: Science and technology creates problems (plastic pollution, cyber attacks)
- **Synthesis**: Solutions also provided by science and technology, but need technology ethics

### Key SOCRATIC Principles (137:00)

#### "Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living"
- **Context**: Said during his trial for corrupting youth minds
- **Application Areas**:
  - Animalistic existence vs purposeful living
  - Internal and external organizational audits
  - Self-reflection and emotional intelligence
  - Individual and organizational self-assessment

#### "Virtue is Knowledge" (140:49)
- **Assumption**: Knowledgeable person won't do anything wrong
- **Immoral Actions**: Stem from ignorance and lack of understanding
- **Education Solution**: Through education and self-reflection, become virtuous person

#### Ultimate Human Aim (142:06)
- **Purpose**: Pursue truth and wisdom
- **Alternative**: Animalistic existence
- **Happiness Definition**: What is right for your soul, not driven by bodily pleasures

#### Unity of Virtues (142:31)
- **Theory**: If you have one virtue, you will get other virtues
- **Example**: Honesty requires courage (honest even facing death/punishment)
- **Criticism**: This theory is debated and criticized
