# Ethics Case Study Orientation and Doctrine of Double Effect

## ORIENTATION AND TEST STRUCTURE (0:00)

- **Purpose**: Orientation session for students writing mains for the first time to discuss how to approach case studies

**Test Schedule Format:**
- **Starting Tuesday**: 1 hour mini test followed by discussion (like section A format)
- **Test Content**: Four case studies, 20 marks each
- **Alternative Options**: 
  - Extended class on Sunday for sixth test, OR
  - Distribute four questions across Friday and Saturday classes (1.5 hour test each day)
  - Discuss six case studies on both days

## DOCTRINE OF DOUBLE EFFECT (1:19)

- **Definition**: Refers to all those decision making scenarios involving actions or decisions that have dual consequences - both positive and negative consequences
- **Key Characteristic**: The negative consequences can be foreseen before making the decision or implementing it
- **Ethical Responsibility**: Since bad consequences can be foreseen beforehand, it casts additional ethical responsibility on the decision maker

**Contrast in Responsibility Levels:**
- **Higher Responsibility**: When consequences can be predicted and will mostly happen
- **Lower Responsibility**: When consequences are unintended and unpredictable (like unintended lockdown consequences or rare medical side effects)

### Examples of Double Effect Scenarios

**War Context:**
- Can definitely anticipate that people will be killed
- Can definitely anticipate violence will happen
- Done for good intention (maintaining peace, protecting citizens)

**Whistleblowing Context:**
- Can definitely anticipate bringing disrepute to organizational reputation
- Can definitely anticipate violating secrecy
- Done for good intention (protecting larger public interest)

**Law and Order (Lathi Charge/Tear Gas):**
- Can definitely anticipate some bad consequences
- Done for good intention (maintaining law and order)
- Without control, potentially worse consequences (more deaths)

**Abortion Context:**
- Can definitely anticipate taking a life
- The life would become a full-grown human being if continued

### Key Principle

- **Both Effects Inseparable**: Like manthan amat (churning), both amrit (nectar) and poison come together - cannot separate good from bad effects
- **Decision-Making Complexity**: More difficult than simple right versus wrong decisions
- **Examiner Focus**: More interested in arguments and qualifying criteria used than the actual decision itself
- **Ethical Reasoning Priority**: Most space should be given to ethical reasoning and how exactly you arrive at the decision

### Qualifying Criteria for Doctrine of Double Effect

**1. Intentions are Paramount**
- **Primary Purpose**: Must be positive/good intention
- **Examples of Wrong Intentions**:
  - Whistleblowing just to appear on prime time
  - War not for peace but for punishment or gaining popularity
  - Law and order violence to teach lessons rather than maintain peace

**2. Nature of Act Must Be Good**
- **Per Se Requirement**: The act itself must be ethically right or at least neutral
- **Legitimate Authority**: Only authorized entities can perform certain acts
  - State is legitimate authority to wage war (not individual groups)
  - Police is legitimate authority to use violence (not citizens)
  - Doctor is legitimate authority to perform surgery

**3. Good Effect Should Be Intended, Bad Effect Should Be Mere Consequence**
- Should not intend bad effect
- Bad effect should be side effect only

**4. Due Diligence in Minimizing Harm**
- Must exercise due diligence to minimize foreseeable harm
- Must do best to minimize bad consequences

**5. Proportionality**
- **Response Must Be Proportional**: Should be proportionate to the cause
- **Examples**:
  - Nuclear weapon on Pakistan for terrorist attack = disproportionate
  - Surgical strike = proportionate measure
- Should do more good than harm

### Application Examples

| Context | Criteria Application |
|---------|---------------------|
| **War** | Last resort, legitimate authority, reasonable assurance of success, intention to reestablish peace, proportionality |
| **Whistleblowing** | Last resort, internal hierarchy approached first, facts verified, proportional to public interest harm, public interest (not publicity) intention |
| **Law and Order** | Last resort (peaceful means exhausted), intention to maintain law and order (not punish), precautions taken, proportionate violence, responsibility for consequences |

## CASE STUDY APPROACH (31:49)

### Basic Structure and Expectations

- **Current Format**: 20 marks case studies (previously 25 marks)
- **Word Limit**: Theoretical guideline - more important to follow time limit
- **Time Limit**: Should be adhered to strictly
- **Core Testing**: Decision-making skill and ability

### Key Focus Areas

**Reasoning Over Decision:**
- **Primary Differentiator**: How examiners differentiate between answers
- **Two-Level Justification**:
  1. **Approach Justification**: Why choosing this particular course of action among various options
  2. **Action Justification**: Specific steps within chosen approach and their objectives

**Example Framework:**
- **Scenario**: SP dealing with sand mafia, family threatened
- **Approach Options**: Seek transfer, continue job, stop raids
- **Approach Justification**: Ethical perspective on why continuing the job
- **Action Justification**: Specific steps like requesting family security and their purposes

### Writing Strategy

**Justification Priority:**
- Choose justification over merits/demerits analysis
- **Merits/Demerits Guidelines**:
  - Maximum 5 points total
  - Extremely unethical option: 4 demerits, 1 merit
  - Extremely ethical option: 4 merits, 1 demerit
  - Don't elaborate extensively unless only two questions in case study

**Most Important Components:**
- Course of action justification
- Conclusion
- These create the real difference in answers

## TYPES OF CASE STUDIES (41:21)

### Context-Based Classification

**Public Sector Case Studies:**
- **Key Principles**: Constitutional morality, constitution, preamble
- **Rights Focus**: Citizen rights
- **Important Elements**: Regulatory framework usually not applicable

**Private Sector Case Studies:**
- **Key Principles**: Consumer rights, corporate governance, Companies Act
- **Rights Focus**: Customer rights
- **Important Elements**: Board of directors, regulators

- **Focus**: Company-specific ethical principles

## READING CASE STUDIES CAREFULLY (46:04)

### Reading Strategy

**Comprehensive Reading:**
- **Read Very Carefully**: Often miss specific arguments and issues
- **Generate Arguments**: Case study helps with argument generation if read carefully
- **Identify Elements**: Dilemmas, issues, and stakeholders

### Context Setting Keywords

**Character Description:**
- **Example**: "Honest, upright and bright officer"
- **Implication**: Virtue ethics will come into play
- **Consequence**: Unethical decisions will cause crisis of conscience

**Always Take Overview:**
- **Avoid Linear Reading**: Don't get engrossed with peripheral issues
- **Systemic Perspective**: Look for systemic failures
- **Solution Division**: Long-term and short-term perspectives

### Important Guidelines

**Rule Breaking:**
- **Never Break Rules**: Should never break rules and laws in case study
- **PM's "Go Beyond Rules"**: Means follow rules but don't hide behind them, be proactive

**Scope Awareness:**
- **Authority Limits**: Remember what exactly you can do
- **Examples**:
  - SP cannot impose Section 144 (DM's power) - must request DM
  - Don't behave like collector if you're not one

**Time Management:**
- **Critical Importance**: Don't kill chances by spending too much time
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Extra 1-2 marks vs 4-4.5 marks from Section A
- **Time Allocation**: 14 minutes per case study

### Writing Approach

**Never Take Shortcuts:**
- **No Short-term Solutions**: Always think long-term
- **Be Assertive and Persuasive**: Especially in justification writing
- **Avoid Keyword Dumping**: Don't just drop keywords without proper sentences

## CASE STUDY EXAMPLES AND ANALYSIS (53:00)

### Example 1: Construction Engineering Case

**Context Setting:**
- **Position**: Executive engineer (professional ethics applicable)
- **Responsibility**: Construction of municipal corporation, presently in charge
- **Hierarchy**: Two juniors under you, reporting to chief engineer
- **Issue**: Serious deviations affecting flyover safety discovered during surprise inspection

**Key Elements:**
- **Professional Responsibility**: If something bad happens, it's ultimately your failure
- **Opinion vs Fact**: "In your opinion" - acknowledge you could be wrong
- **Senior's Advice**: Chief engineer says not serious - respect experience but follow conscience

**Solution Approach:**
- **External Vetting**: Must vet decision by external authority before proceeding
- **Systemic Issues**: Address failure of internal risk management
- **Preventive Measures**: Suggest continuous third-party audits, social audits
- **Accountability**: Fix accountability of junior engineers who were reporting incorrectly

### Example 2: Municipal Commissioner Case

**Character Establishment:**

- **Consequences**: Any unethical action will cause crisis of conscience and damage credibility

**Ethical Dilemmas:**
- **Professional vs Personal**: Previous commissioner is both senior and good friend
- **Conflict**: Ethics in public relationship vs ethics in private relationship
- **Pressure Pattern**: Reward offered (fortune) + punishment threatened (sexual harassment case)

**Standard UPSC Pattern:**
- **Reward Structure**: Promotion, powerful positions, early benefits
- **Punishment Structure**: Cases filed, denied promotion, remote posting, dismissal
- **Emotional Elements**: Family health issues, children's education, financial pressures

### Reading Strategy for Emotional Content

**Maintain Dispassion:**
- **Don't Get Emotional**: Read with impersonal approach
- **Recognize Patterns**: Understand UPSC's standard dilemma creation method
- **Stay Focused**: Don't get swayed by dramatic elements

**Pattern Recognition:**
- **Cost-Benefit Together**: Standard way to create dilemmas
- **Identify Quickly**: Should smile when seeing these patterns
- **Read Faster**: Once pattern recognized, can process quickly
