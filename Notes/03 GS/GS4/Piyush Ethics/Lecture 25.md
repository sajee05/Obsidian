# Ethics Enrichment Class 25 - Case Study Analysis and Ethical Framework Application

## CLASS INTRODUCTION AND REVIEW (00:00)

- The instructor begins by addressing students about feeling unwell in the last half hour of the previous class
- Question posed: "Is there any doubt from the last half an hour what we discussed regarding conclusion and body part from yesterday's class?"
- Emphasis on communication effectiveness and student understanding
- Transition to starting with the first case study: **Rashika**

## CASE STUDY 1: RASHIKA - WORK-LIFE BALANCE CHALLENGES (00:50)

### Background and Context

- **UPSC Relevance**: The same question was asked by UPSC in section A this year in the context of challenges faced by women in the working environment
- **Key Demographics**: Children aged three and five (important because of creche facility available in maternity benefit)
- **Core Issue**: Balancing private life and professional life

### Important Keywords of the Case Study

1. **Work-Life Balance**: Balance between professional life and personal life, work life and private life
2. **Work Culture**: Government organization culture where short notice work assignments are given
3. **Dual Burden**: Reinforcing patriarchal expectations through "discharging essential social obligation"

### Stakeholder Perspective Analysis for Ethical Issues

**From Rashika's Perspective:**
- **Golden Mean**: She's missing the work-life balance
- **Conflict of Duty**: Duty towards children vs professional desires need to be balanced
- **Fairness Issues**: Not being treated fairly
- **Ethical Egoism**: Need for self-care, as "high pedestal for women is as much a prison for them"
- **Care Ethics**: She needs to take care of herself also
- **Double Burden**: Social obligations creating inhuman expectations

**From Superior's Perspective:**
- **Leadership Issues**: Lack of empathy, not considering personal commitments
- **Abuse of Power**: Giving work on short notice without consideration
- **Means vs Ends**: Treating people as means only, not understanding dignity
- **Work Culture Problems**: Routine sacrifice of personal life has become part of work culture

**From Husband (Vikram's) Perspective:**
- **Moral Responsibility**: Complicit in not doing his duty
- **Systematic Discrimination**: Routinely absent, creating double burden

**From Children's Perspective:**
- **Rights Violation**: Not being treated fairly in terms of their right to parental care
- **Parental Duty**: Both parents absent with respect to their duty, lacking parental love and support

**From Societal Perspective:**
- **Common Good Approach**: Family as an institution will suffer
- **Socialization Failure**: If this becomes general norm, we will fail in our duty of raising children properly
- **Categorical Imperative**: This sort of work culture cannot be universalized
- **Reciprocity Principle**: Whether the boss would allocate same work to his wife at short notice

### Laws and Legal Framework (Four Laws)

- Maternity Benefit Act
- Equal Remuneration Act
- Protection of Women from Sexual Harassment
- Various other protective acts

## CASE STUDY SOLUTION APPROACH - BREAKING DOWN PROBLEMS (10:00)

### Systematic Problem-Solving Methodology

- **Macro Perspective Required**: Address challenges in different ways, not just towards one stakeholder
- **Component Analysis**: Break down different components of the problem that need solving
- **Multi-stakeholder Solutions**: Suggest something to Rashika, her boss, organization, husband, etc.

### Suggestions for Rashika

1. **Communication Strategy**: 
   - Communicate with senior, exhort his empathy
   - Dialogue should be first statement, not filing complaint immediately
   - Negotiate manageable workload
   - Explore flexible work arrangements, work from home

2. **Boundary Setting**:
   - Set boundaries: "I will not be working on this until unless it is absolutely necessary"
   - Should not become routine

3. **Prioritize and Delegate Principle**:
   - Ask yourself: "Can this thing wait or not?"
   - 50% of problems/tasks will simply go if you solve them tomorrow or day after tomorrow
   - Second: Whether it is you only who have to do it, or can someone else be delegated
   - You can delegate something to subordinates also

4. **Children's Care**:
   - Creche facility as part of maternity benefit
   - Share responsibilities and duties with husband or immediate family members

5. **Self-Care**:
   - Take care of physical and mental health
   - Yoga, meditation, emotional intelligence
   - Have broader meaning of success - not just professional success but also success in duty with respect to children

6. **Seek Justice**: If things do not improve, must seek justice - raise complaints, seek redress

### Suggestions for Superior and Organization

1. **Leadership Development**:
   - Empathy and compassion should be part of work culture
   - Ethical leadership trait is desired
   - Lead by example for higher productivity and morale

2. **Work Management**:
   - Prudent workload management
   - Better planning to avoid short notice assignments
   - Fair distribution of work
   - Proper planning should be there

3. **Flexible Work Arrangements**:
   - Work from home options
   - Legal compliance with maternity benefits
   - Improve management style for better communication of grievances

4. **Training and Development**:
   - Sensitive training
   - Role playing methods
   - Team building exercises
   - Google example for productivity, morale, motivation interconnection

## JUSTIFICATION FRAMEWORK - TWO LEVELS (20:22)

### First Level of Justification
- **Purpose**: Why you are taking one particular option among all available options
- **Focus**: Why exactly you are choosing this course of action only
- **Basis**: Concerns, virtue approach, consequences, duty - different arguments can be used

### Second Level of Justification  
- **Purpose**: Action-oriented reasoning for specific steps
- **Format**: "I will do this to achieve that" or "To achieve this, I will do this"
- **Examples**:
  - "I will prepare report by third party to ensure objectivity"
  - "To ensure team spirit, we will conduct cultural events"
  - "To change attitude of leadership, we will have role-playing methods"
  - "To ensure emotional sensitivity, we will have sensitivity training"

**Key Point**: You are not just dumping keywords - you are communicating why you are employing those methods

## CASE STUDY 2: ETHICAL CONDUCT VS UNFAIR PRACTICES (37:37)

### Core Dilemma Statement
- **General Perception**: "Adhering to ethical conduct one may face difficulties to oneself and cause problems for the family whereas unfair practices may help to reach the career goal"
- **Context**: This represents core scenarios found in many case studies (sand mafia threats, career advancement through unethical means)

### Arguments Against Unfair Practices

1. **Short-term vs Long-term Perspective**:
   - Shelf life of lie is very small
   - Truth will ultimately come out, leading to more problems
   - Crisis of conscience will be there for honest civil servant

2. **Career Goal Redefinition**:
   - Career goal should not be just about posting, but about being effective in your posting
   - Being effective requires honesty - dishonesty leads to credibility crisis
   - No one will respect you if you follow unfair means

3. **Family Impact Analysis**:
   - Role modeling for children - you become great role model for your child
   - Inculcating right set of values in family
   - If you go to jail, who will take care of family? - biggest disservice and problem

4. **Personal Fulfillment**:
   - Lot of sense of fulfillment and ultimate happiness from doing duty with conscience
   - Better than short-term rewards that lead to fear and punishment

### Counter-Arguments to "Everyone is Doing It"

1. **Historical Precedent**: 
   - Minorities have made lot of difference - GANDHI, NELSON MANDELA, RAJA RAM MOHAN ROY, ISHWAR CHANDRA VIDYASAGAR
   - Don't underestimate the power of individual action

2. **Truth vs Lie Principle**:
   - "Truth is truth even if no one believes it"
   - "A lie is lie even if everyone believes in it"

3. **Individual Responsibility**:
   - "If no one is supporting me then it is time for me to walk the path alone"
   - Need to be responsible for what you are doing, be true to your conscience

### Development vs Ethics Argument

**Claim**: "Sticking to ethical means is detrimental to the larger developmental goals"

**Counter-Arguments**:
1. **Short-term vs Long-term Development**:
   - Maybe short-term GDP growth, but long-term problems like climate change, inequality
   - Hurt market functioning, ease of doing business, foreign investment

2. **Market Economy Impact**:
   - Unethical environment attracts fewer investors
   - Example: African nation canceled deal with Indian company due to bribery charges, 20% fall in share prices

3. **Inclusiveness and Sustainability**:
   - Policy making only serves powerful people, not inclusive
   - Not sustainable development if entire population not developed
   - Example: China - islands of prosperity in Shanghai, Beijing vs poor countryside conditions

### Gift Exchange and Curtesy Discussion

**The Curtesy System**:
- **Definition**: Gifts received without demanding, considered "honest" in bureaucracy parlance
- **Ethical Issues**:
  - Creates sense of reciprocity and obligation
  - Loss of free will in decision making
  - "Show me the gift I will show you the rule" mentality
  - May compromise disciplinary actions against gift-givers

**Arguments Against Gift Exchange**:
1. **Professional Integrity**: Already getting salary to do the job
2. **Relationship Building**: Not the only way to foster relationships - can help subordinates, play games, take care of mental health
3. **Public Perception**: Justice should not only be done but seen to be done
4. **Legal Consequences**: Against code of conduct, illegal

## CASE STUDY 3: RAMPURA - TRIBAL GIRLS AND CHILD LABOR (65:03)

### Ethical Issues from Stakeholder Perspective

- **Fundamental Rights**: Right to life, health, education violated
- **Poor Working Conditions**: Informal slavery conditions

**From Contractors' Perspective**:
- **Means vs Ends**: Using girls as means only
- **Exploitation**: Taking advantage of vulnerable populations

**From NGOs' Perspective**:

2. **Medical Examination**: To ascertain any potential sexual abuse cases
3. **Special Schools**: Education plus vocational training to make them employable
4. **Support Systems**: Midday meals, stipends
5. **Child Protection**: Strengthening child protection mechanisms

**Economic Conditions of Families**:
1. **Livelihood Diversification**: Agriculture reforms
2. **Market Linkages**: SHGs, FPOs, cooperatives

**Systemic Solutions**:
1. **Accountability**: Better implementation through Gram Sabha, social audit, citizen charter
2. **NGO Monitoring**: Auditing and monitoring, official partnership in service delivery
3. **Deterrence**: Legal action against contractors

## CASE STUDY 4: RAKKESH - WORKPLACE ACCIDENT COMPENSATION (75:52)

### Legal Framework for Workplace Accidents

**Two Key Criteria**:
1. **During Course of Employment**: Accident must happen while performing job duties
2. **Arising Out of Employment**: Accident must be related to job responsibilities

**Examples of Application**:
- Going home after work and accident happens: Not employer's responsibility
- Sneaking out for personal work during office hours and accident: Not arising out of employment
- Sent for official survey and attacked: Both criteria met, employer responsible

### Contributory Negligence Analysis

**Definition**: Contribution of different parties to the accident occurrence

**Factors to Consider**:
1. **Safety Equipment**: Was helmet/safety gear provided and used?
2. **Employee Conduct**: Was employee drunk or negligent?
3. **Work Conditions**: Congested routes, work pressure, working hours
4. **Previous Instances**: Employee's character and past behavior
5. **Provocation**: What led to the violent incident?

**Legal Precedents**:
- **Bus Jumping Case**: 50% relief due to contributory negligence of passenger
- **Truck Driver Case**: Employer liable despite driver's heart condition due to excessive working hours (12-13 hours)

### Decision-Making Framework

**Investigation Requirements**:
1. **Circumstantial Analysis**: What actually led to the incident
2. **Character Assessment**: Previous instances of such outbursts
3. **Work Environment**: Contribution of job stress/conditions
4. **Contributory Factors**: All parties' role in the incident

**Compensation Principles**:
1. **Due Process**: Thorough investigation before decision
2. **Proportionate Relief**: Based on contributory negligence findings
3. **Promptness**: Whatever relief decided should be delivered promptly
4. **Transparency**: Clear communication of findings and rationale
5. **Fairness**: Consistent application of principles

**Employment Considerations**:
- Employment is always at discretion of government
- Death of government employee does not entitle family to job as matter of right
- Compassionate appointments are discretionary, not entitlements

## NORWAY WORK-LIFE BALANCE INSIGHTS (30:55)

### Cultural Perspective on Work-Life Balance

**Norwegian Approach**:
- **Mandatory Holidays**: Must take holidays in summer, treated as outcast if you don't
- **Work Hours**: 5:30 work hours over, people go home and enjoy life
- **Life Philosophy**: "There is life beyond work"
- **Summer Houses**: Temporary luxurious houses by fjords for 1-2 month stays
- **Quality of Life**: Tremendously good quality of life

**Social Security System**:
- **High Taxes**: 30-40% salary as taxes but extensive benefits
- **Free Services**: Education free, healthcare free
- **Unemployment Benefits**: Hefty allowances for 1-2 years while job searching
- **Elderly Care**: Government homes for old age care
- **Wealth Transfer**: Heavy taxation on inheritance to discourage accumulation mentality

**Contrast with Indian Mentality**:
- **Financial Security Focus**: Save for healthcare, education, children due to lack of social security
- **Quality vs Quantity**: African-like life quality compared to developed countries
- **Educational System**: Skill-based learning vs academic competition

| Aspect | Norway | India |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Work Hours | Strict 5:30 finish, mandatory breaks | Extended hours, weekend work |
| Taxation | 30-40% but extensive returns | High taxes, limited public services |
