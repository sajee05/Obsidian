- Nutrients are substance in our food which are essential for growth and maintenance of life and health. - **Macronutrients** - Nutrients needed in a larger amount
    
    - E.g. - Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
- **Micronutrients -** Needed in a smaller
    
    - For example - vitamins,  minerals, etc.

1. **CARBOHYDRATES**
    
    - Naturally occurring compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen can be broken down to release energy.
    - Also called **Saccharides****.**

- **Types of Carbohydrate**
    
    - **Monosaccharides** - they are the ==simplest form== of carbohydrates which cannot be broken down into further simpler forms.
        
        - For example - ==Glucose== (main energy source),  ==Fructose== (called Fruit sugar), ==Galactose== (a component in milk) 
    - **Oligosaccharides** - 2-10 monosaccharides unit joined through a Glycosidic bond to form an oligosaccharide.
        
        - Example -
            
            - Sucrose (Glucose + Fructose)
            - Maltose (Glucose + Glucose) - found in Malt syrups
            - Lactose (Glucose + Galactose) - Milk Sugar

2. **Multicellular:** Organisms that consist of more than one cell.
 - The different cells are specialized for different functions all of which coordinate to make life possible for an organism. e.g. Insects, Plant, and the Human body 
1. **Prokaryotic Organisms:** they are ==unicellular== organisms that **lack a** **membrane-bound nucleus and cell organelle.** 
    
    - The Genetic material which is DNA is circular and present in the **Nucleoid region.** 
    - E.g. Bacteria, Cyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae)
2. **Eukaryotic organisms:** they can be unicellular or multicellular which have a **membrane-bound nucleus and cell organelle.**
    
    - Genetic material i.e. _DNA is linear and is organized in the form of Chromosomes_ which are found in the Nucleus. e**.g. Plants, Animals, and Fungus.**

- They are the carriers of diseases.
- Vectors are organisms that do not cause the disease itself but spreads the infection by taking pathogens from one organism to another.
- Mechanical vector & Biological vector;
    
    1. **Mechanical vectors** carry the pathogens on the surface of their bodies & transmit the disease through physical contact.

        - **Benign -** they are ==localized== to a particular part of the body and do not spread to other parts
        - **Malignant cancer -** invade and destroy surrounding healthy tissues
 
- Immunity is the balanced state of organisms having adequate biological defences to fight infection and having adequate tolerance to avoid allergy.
    
    - ![Types of Immunity BioNinja](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061704-3.jpeg)
      
    
- **Two types of immunity**
    
    - **Active (**Natural and Artificial Immunity-vaccination) -  results from the production of antibodies by the immune system in response to the Antigen
    - **Passive Immunity** **:** antibodies are administered from outside to protect against specific antigens. (Natural-Mother milk and Artificial immunity-Anti snake venom) - antibodies that are administered from outside
      
    
- **Two types of** **Defenses**
    
    - **Innate**
        
        - It is the nonspecific response of the body which is available immediately forming the first line of defence of an individual.
        - **Examples:**
            
            - ==Physical== barriers - Skin and Mucus membranes.
            - ==Chemical== Barriers - Tears, saliva, HCL in the Stomach.
            - ==Cellular== Defence - Neutrophylls and Monocytes(White Blood Cells).
      
    - **Acquired Immunity/Adaptive Immunity**
        
        - It is a specific immune response that is activated on exposure to a pathogen. It is slower than the innate immunity
        - Antibody-mediated immune response
        - Cell-mediated immune response

- **Antigen & Antibody** 
    
    - ==Antigen - Any agent which triggers an immune response== #remember-for-later
    - Antibody - Proteins produced as a response to the Antigen
    - Phagocytosis- Process by which a cell uses its Plasma Membrane to engulf a large particle and then digest it.
    - **Lymphocytes - a type of WBCs**
        
        - **Two types:**
            
            - **B Cell:** formed in the bone marrow and are responsible for the production of Antibody;
                
                - Antibody-mediated immune response.
            - **T Cell:** formed in the bone marrow and goes into Thymus for maturation; ==Cell-mediated== Immune response.
                
                - They help in coordinating immune response by releasing ==cytokines==.
                - Different types
                    
                    - **Cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells):** These cells directly kill infected cells or cancerous cells by creating holes in their membranes.
                    - **Helper T cells (Th cells):** They orchestrate the immune response by activating other immune cells, including B cells,cytotoxic T cells, and macrophages (cells that engulf and destroy pathogens).
                    - **Regulatory T cells (Tregs):** They help regulate the immune response to prevent autoimmune diseases (where the immune system attacks healthy body tissues).
                  
                
 
- A process by which a person is made immune/resistant to infectious diseases by stimulating the body’s own immune system
- When the body encounters an antigen for the first time a low-intensity slow response is given by the B- Cells in the way of producing Antibodies and remain sensitized by the creation of immunological memory.
- On a subsequent attack/secondary attack, this immune memory is activated and high intensity and fast immune response. This is the rationale for vaccine. - **Types of Vaccine -** **LIV-CDS**
    
    - **Live attenuated**: The ==pathogen is weakened== so that it doesn’t cause disease but retains its capacity to grow.
        
        - E.g. ==Oral Polio Vaccine==, Rotavirus, BCG, MMR.
    - **Inactivated/killed** **:**- The ==pathogen here is killed== but its proteins present are still able to produce an immune response.
        
        - E.g. ==injectable Polio vaccine==, influenza vaccine
        - Covaxin by Bharat Biotech
    - **Viral vector vaccine:**
        
        - uses a harmless virus (often a common cold virus) modified to carry a gene from the pathogen.
        - Example: Covishield by Serum Institute of India
    - **Subunit vaccine -** uses specific part of the pathogen like protein or polysaccharide -
        
        - E.g. Tetanus, whooping cough
    - **Conjugate vaccine** - when more than one subunits are used in the vaccine -
        
        - E.g. ==Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine==

- Digestion means the breakdown of food into simpler smaller forms/components through digestive enzymes.
- Enzymes are bio-catalysts.
- The **mouth** is the first place where food enters.
    
    - ==Salivary== glands are there in the mouth.
    - These glands secret saliva.
    - Saliva contains **amylase****.**
        
        - It is an enzyme that helps in breaking up carbohydrates.
- After this food enters **Oesophagus** or food pipe.
    
    - It is a passage through which food goes to the stomach from the mouth.
- In the ==Stomach==, there are the **gastric glands** that produce ==gastric juice== containing **HCL and Protease****.**
    
    - It will break down the ==proteins==.
    - Sphincters are there to close parts of the digestive system when needed.
        
        - These are the muscles that act as lids.
- The small intestine is the longest part of the digestive system.
    
    - Still, it is called Small due to its lesser diameter as compared to the large intestine.
    - The small intestine releases **intestinal juice.**
        
        - It has its own set of enzymes like **peptidase, sucrase, maltase, and lactase.**
    - Here the digestion of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates takes place.
    - The ==liver produces== **bile juice.**
        
        - The bile does not has enzymes but helps in the digestion of ==fats==.
        - ==Gall bladder stores bile== before it is secreted into the small intestine.
        - It makes the acidic food coming from stomach alkaline so that pancreatic enzymes can act on it.
    - The **pancreas** will produce pancreatic juice.
        
        - It has **proteases** and **lipases.**
        - ==Protease digest protein and lipase digest fats.==
    - The process of digestion completes in the Small intestine.
    - Absorption of nutrients takes place in the small intestine.
        
        - ==Villi== present on the walls of the small intestine help in ==absorption==.
- Blood takes nutrients to other parts of the body.
- In the large intestine, water is absorbed and waste is removed.
- Through Anus, waste materials are expelled.
 
- Energy production takes place through respiration.
- There are 2 parts of the process of respiration:
    
    - Cellular respiration
    - Gaseous exchange
- **Aerobic** ==respiration.== #remember-for-later
    
    - Glucose in the **presence of oxygen** is burnt down and broken down to give out carbon dioxide, water, and energy.
- **Anaerobic** ==respiration is respiration without oxygen.== #remember-for-later
    
    - It happens in rare situations in the human body.
    - Example-
        
        - In muscle cells (when a  person is exercising) where ==glucose breaks down into lactic acid and energy==,
        - ==Lactic acid results in muscle cramps.== #remember-for-later
        - Anaerobic respiration is a property of organisms like yeast and bacteria.
        - This process is called ==fermentation==.
        - Here the ==glucose breaks down into ethanol and energy.==
- Process of Gaseous exchange:
    
    - Air enters our body through the nasal cavity.
    - From the nasal cavity, it goes to the **pharynx**.
    - The larynx is thereafter pharynx.
        
        - This larynx is the voice box having vocal cords.
        - It helps in speech.
    - The trachea is there after this.
        
        - It is also called a windpipe.
        - The trachea divides into 2 parts called Bronchi (Singular: Bronchus).
            
            - The Bronchi and further divides into Bronchioles.
            - Bronchioles end into alveoli.
    - These alveoli are the air sacs that have a rich blood supply.
    - **RBCs have haemoglobin.**
        
        - It attaches to the oxygen and takes oxygen along with it to each and every part of the body.
        - Blood containing carbon dioxide is brought back to the alveoli and is exhaled out through the lungs.

- Kidneys help in waste removal.
- It also helps in regulating the amount of water in the body.
- Kidneys perform filtration.
- Kidney has a number of small units called **Nephrons**.
- There are 2 parts of nephrons:
    
    - Bowman's capsules, and
    - Glomerulus.
- These filter the blood.
- During filtration, useful materials like minerals are sent back to the body.
- The waste material is removed in the form of urine.
- Urine gets stored in the urinary bladder.
- The excretion of urine takes place through the urethra.
- Composition of Urine:
    
    - Urea 2.5%,
    - Other waste 2.5 %, and
    - water 95%.
- **Kidney stones** are made up of **Calcium oxalate.**
    
    - Kidney stones are common in people who drink less water.
 
- The nervous system can be divided into:
    
    - The central nervous system(==CNS==) and
        
        - CNS is made up of the ==Brain and Spinal cord.==
    - The peripheral nervous system (==PNS==).
        
        - PNS is made up of ==nerves==.
            
            - Nerves bring and take the signal.
            - The signals are processed in the brain and spine.
        - Nerves are of 2 types:
            
            - Sensory nerves:
                
                - Those nerves that take signals to CNS.
            - Motor nerves:
                
                - Those which bring signals from the CNS.
 
- It is made up of:
    
    - Heart
    - Blood
    - Blood vessels
- **Heart and Blood vessels:**
    
    - A heart divided into 4 chambers:
        
        - Right and Left Atrium
        - Right and Left ventricles
        - Four Chambers of the heart are supported by blood vessels:
            
            - Arteries and
            - Veins.

- **Artery:**
    
    - ==Takes blood away from the heart,==
    - ==Red== in colour,
    - deep-seated
    - thick-walled, and
    - ==carry oxygenated blood== except for the **pulmonary artery**.

- **Veins:**

            - Haemoglobin contains iron.
        - ==RBCs are== **enucleated**==.==
        - **Packed cell volume(PCV)** is measurement of the proportion of the volume of blood that is made up of Red blood cells.
            
            - Generally PCV test range from 35%-48%.
                
                - Low PCV - anemia, AIDS, HCV(hepatitis C virus)
                - High PCV - liver disease.

                - Agranulocytes do not contain granules in their cytoplasm.
                - Two types of Agranulocytes are there:
                    
                    - ==Lymphocyte== and
                        
                        - Lymphocytes are further divided into ==B-cells and T-cells.==
                    - ==Monocytes==.
                        
                        - Monocytes are responsible for ==innate immunity.==
            - ==Granulocytes==
                
                - Granulocytes contain granules.
                - ==Neutrophils==: These are involved in innate immunity.
                - ==Eosinophil==: They are involved in allergic reactions.
                - ==Basophil==: They are involved in inflammation.

            Imagine your body is a castle under siege.
            
            - **Lucocytes (White Blood Cells):** These are the entire army defending the castle, with different types of soldiers for various tasks.
            - **Neutrophils and Monocytes:** These are like the front-line soldiers who directly attack and engulf enemies (germs) trying to breach the castle walls.
            - **Eosinophils and Basophils:** These are like specialized soldiers who deal with specific threats like allergic reactions.
            - **Lymphocytes:** These are the elite forces that recognize specific enemies and develop targeted strategies (antibodies or direct attacks) to defeat them effectively.
            - **B cells:** These are like archers who can launch specialized weapons (antibodies) to take down specific enemies.
            - **T cells:** These are like the commanders who strategize, activate other soldiers, and coordinate the overall defensive response.

- ![DNA vs RNA Introduction and Differences between DN...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061715-9.png) - **DNA** has a sugar called deoxyribose sugar.
    
    - ==Double-stranded. Double helix structure.==
    - DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.
    - In the structure of DNA, Nucleotides pair up into strands that are twisted together into a spiral structure called the double helix DNA.
    - Complementary base pairing takes place A joins to T (double bond) and G joins to C (triple bond)
        
        - ==A=T==
        - ==G====≡====C==
    - Segments of DNA tell individual cells how to produce specific proteins.
    - The presence or absence of specific proteins gives an organism its specific trait or characteristic.
    - Transcription of a particular segment of DNA to messenger RNA takes place in the cell nucleus.
        
        - The process by which DNA nucleotides are copied into RNA.
    - Translation of messenger RNA to the specific protein takes place in the cytoplasm on the ribosomes. #remember-for-later
        
        - Process of synthesizing a protein from mRNA template is known as translation.

- **RNA vaccine**
    
    - They work by introducing an mRNA sequence that is coded for a disease-specific antigen.
 
- All normal cells are somatic cells except the Sperm and Ovum cells/Gametes/Sex cells.
- Both male and female sex cells fuse to form zygotes.
- The zygote starts dividing and the embryo is formed-grown into a foetus and the baby is born.
- There are 46 Chromosomes in any somatic human cell.
- Gametes/Sex cells for reproduction have 23 chromosomes.

- ==Haploid== : Single set of unpaired chromosomes. It is represented as N.
    
    - Gametes and sex cells like sperm and egg contain a haploid set of chromosomes. Also called germ cells.
- ==Diploid== - Two sets of chromosomes one coming from each parent. It is represented as 2N.

- All the characteristics in the human body are expressed in pairs.
- Homologous chromosomes : a set of maternal and paternal chromosomes that pair up inside the cell-similar in length etc.

- **Mendel's genetic experiment and Blood grouping**
    
    - All the characters in an organism are manifested in two factors.
    - These factors or Genes are the unit’s inheritance.
    - Dominant trait, the one which overrides the impact of the other trait. For example –
        
        - The green colour of the pod in the case of the pea plant. (Explained with example).
    - A recessive trait is one that doesn’t express itself in the presence of the dominant trait and finds expression only in homozygous form.
    - ==Homozygous== – when both the genes are the same. (GG, gg).
    - ==Heterozygous==: Both genes are different. (Gg)
    - **Phenotype** ==- observable characteristic in an organism.== #remember-for-later

- **Gene Abnormalities:**
    
    - **Autosomal  Recessive Disease** #remember-for-later
        
        - e.g. Sickle Cell Anaemia:
            
            - The shape of RBCs changes.
            - It becomes sickle-shaped.
            - Due to that shape, the haemoglobin is not able to stay inside RBCs.
            - India plan's to eliminate sickle cell Anaemia by 2047
    - **Sex-linked Recessive Diseases**
        
        - e.g. Colour Blindness and Haemophilia.
        - Haemophilia is a disease of clotting of blood.

- “Speciation is the process of formation of new species from existing populations.”
- **Allopatric Speciation**
    
    - caused by ==geographical== isolation
- **Sympatric Speciation**
    
    - from the surviving ancestral species in which both the species continue to live in the same geographical region. They develop ==reproductive isolation== due to ==preference== or timing of mating.
- **Parapatric Speciation**
    
    - two subpopulations are not isolated rather instead 'beside' each other. Individual within population only mate with individual in their immediate area. There is no extrinsic barrier to gene flow
- **Peripatric Speciation**
    
    - New species form from an ==geographically isolated peripheral population== where only few individuals survive  - [https://onlyias.com/upscnotes/biotechnology/](https://onlyias.com/upscnotes/biotechnology/)

    - A DNA fragment is taken and it is then added to the vector.
    - In genetics, Vector is a DNA fragment that acts as a carrier to required DNA.
    - Most of the DNA Vaccines are of this type.
    - Process:
        
        - Isolation of the desired gene
        - ==The enzymes which cut DNA are called== **Nucleases**==.==
        - Vector is needed for carrying the desired gene.
            
            - e.g. Plasmid DNA from bacteria acts as a vector.
        - A **ligase enzyme** is needed to join the DNA.

    - **Artificial Cloning**
        
        - ==Gene/DNA Cloning== - transfer of ==DNA== fragment from one organism ==to self replicating genetic element== such as bacterial plasmid.
          
        - ==Reproductive cloning== - transfer of nucleus material isolated from ==somatic cell into enucleated oocyte (egg cell==). Then this oocyte form embryo with same genome as the nuclear donor. This process is called ==Somatic cell Nuclear Transfer (==**SSNT**).
          
        - Therapeutic cloning - similar to the reproductive cloning till the production of embryo. The produced embryo is then grown in the laboratory.
          
        
    - **Animal cloning**
        
        - Somatic cells from the animal to be cloned.
        - Donors who give egg cells are from that **same species**.
        - **Enucleation** - i.e. removal of the nucleus from the donor's egg.
        - The nucleus of the **somatic cell** is kept.
        - Thereafter **somatic cell nuclear transfer technique** is adopted to produce an embryo.
        - After the stimulation of the embryo, it is transplanted into the uterus of another or the same female.

        - Adult stem cells: They are ==specific to== different ==tissues== and only form cells of that tissue.
            
            - e.g. Brain, spinal cord, skin, blood, bone marrow.
        - Induced pluripotent stem cells: They are those cells that can be ==induced to divide and become undifferentiated.==
      
    - **Totipotency** : Property of a cell to form ==all types of cells== including embryonic and extraembryonic tissue and are able to divide and differentiate into cells of the whole organism.

- It is a phenomenon in which incident light or heat waves return to the same medium after falling on a surface 
- It means that the medium remains the same 

- When the light changes the medium, it changes its path.
- During refraction, there is no change in the frequency of the wave but the wavelength and the speed changes.
 
- When white light passing through a prism it splits into 7 individual colours (VIBGYOR).
- This happens because different colours have ==different speeds== through any medium.
 
- **Rayleigh scattering:**
    
    - It involves the interaction of electromagnetic waves with particles whose size is smaller when compared to the wavelength of electromagnetic waves.

- Multiple air pockets are present between earth and stars multiple reflections take place through all these air pockets.
- Hence, the line of sight is adjusting every second because of which our eye is unable to locate the exact position of the star.
- Hence we find a star to be twinkling at distant start twinkles more than a nearby star.
 
**Why is the sky blue?**

- **Human eye:**
    
    - ==Cons== (responsible for ==daylight== vision and ==colour== recognition) and ==Rods== (responsible for ==dim== ==light== vision).

    - The concave mirror is also known as a converging mirror because it converges a parallel beam of light at a point called the focus.
    - Focus is also the point where an image is formed.
    - The ==convex mirror== is known as a diverging mirror as it diverges parallel beams of light.
    - A concave mirror is used when we want to ==focus a parallel beam of light or any small object to appear big==, for example, a mirror used for shaving, a mirror used by dentists, headlights of vehicles, torch.

- It is a medical imaging technique that uses a ==strong magnetic field and radio waves== to create detailed images of the inside of the body.
- MRI is based on the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
- NMR is a phenomenon in which the nuclei of certain atoms, such as hydrogen, align themselves in the presence of a strong magnetic field.
- When these nuclei are exposed to radio waves of a specific frequency, they absorb energy and flip their magnetic moments.
- This absorption of energy is measured and used to generate signals that form the basis of MRI images.

    - Honey is more viscous than water.
    - If ==temperature increases, the viscosity of liquid decreases (==cohesive bond breaks), whereas, the ==viscosity of gas increases (gas molecules come closer).==
    - If temperature decreases, the viscosity of blood increases, thereby the heart has to pump more blood, pressure on the heart increases, which might lead to heart failure.
    - Fever increases the temperature of the body, if the temperature of the blood increases, the viscosity of the blood decreases, thereby the heart has lesser pressure leading to normal conditions.

- **Endothermic:**

    - ==Kerosene== (High quality; pale yellow in colour) + more than ==2000 chemicals (==to avoid corrosion, giving them anti-freezing properties)

- **Natural Gas:**
    
    - Two types - Compressed Natural Gas and Liquified Natural Gas.
    - ==LNG has better fuel efficiency== than CNG because the ==fuel density of LNG is higher== than of CNG, but still, ==LNG is not used in India== as storage of LNG requires cryogenic infrastructure to store them.

- **LPG and CNG:**
    
    - Liquified petroleum Gas is mainly Butane, Isobutane, some concentration of Propane along with Ethane is also found.
    - CNG is 99% Methane.
    - LPG is an odourless gas and Ethyl mercaptan is added to give odour to sense the leakage.
    - CNG is also odourless gas and ==sulphur i==s added to give it odour.
    - LPG is heavier than air and in case of leakages, it settles at lower places like parking, godowns, etc.
    - CNG is lighter than air and in case of leakages it flushes out in the atmosphere.

- **Soaps and detergents:**
    
    - They reduce the surface tension of water so that the cleansing properties of water are enhanced.
    - Soap molecules align themselves in such a fashion that dirt is trapped in them. This structure is called as ==Micelles==.
    - In the process of rinsing, micelles come out with dirt, and hence, clothes get cleaned.
    - Soaps are not effective in hard water because they interact with metallic salts present in water and hence, lose their cleansing property. On the other hand, detergents do not interact with metallic salts in hard water and hence, they are effective.
 
**Important terms**

- **Phosphorescence:**
    
    - Some compounds like ==Calcium Sulphid==e, etc, absorb some of the visible spectrums in presence of sunlight.
    - When the sunlight is gone, they ==emit the absorbed spectrum==.
    - Application = ==Divider stones at highways==, Guideposts.
    - Phosphorescence is longer then florescence.

- **Florescence**
    
    - When any substance absorbs light, the electron gets excited and change their orbit.
    - In their return journey, they emit radiations of various wavelengths.
    - This is a comparatively faster process than Phosphorescence.
    - Applications - ==Argon lamps, Glowsticks.==

- **Luminescence**
    
    - Any source (non-living) that gives the light, for example - ==Lightbulb, Mobile, ocean==, etc.

- **Bioluminescence**
    
    - Any ==living sourc==e that emits light, for example- firefly, ==Jellyfishes==. - **Efflorescence:**
    
    - Some salts like washing soda have excess moisture in them.
    - When such salts are kept in the air, moisture evaporates and salt crystals are left behind.
 
- Any two objects in the universe having some mass attract each other by the force of gravitation.
 - **Mars**
    
    - ![Image result for Atmosphere of Mars less than 1](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061806-32.jpeg)

    - Revolution - 224 days
    - Rotation - 243 days
      
    
    
- **The states of Matter-**
    
      
    - **Bose-Einstein Condensate**
      
    
    • When we move from Plasma-Gas-Liquid-solid = energy declines (super cool and super unexcited state). This is the 5th state of matter.   
    ==• In Bose-Einstein condensate state = Every particle loses their identity and behave like a single wave.==
    
      
    - A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter in which a large number of identical bosons are cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero (−273.15°C or −459.67°F) and coalesce into a single quantum mechanical entity, behaving as if they were one giant atom. In this state, the bosons lose their individual identities and become indistinguishable from one another.
      
    - Significance of BECs in Modern Physics:
        
        - Superfluidity : a property where they can flow without any resistance.
            
            - Applications may be in frictionless bearings and ultra-efficient energy transport.
        - Quantum Mechanics : helps in understanding of quantum phenomena, such as wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement.
        - Dark Matter : understanding the nature of dark matter and its role in the universe.
          
        
      
    

- Dark energy is a mysterious force that is thought to be ==responsible for the accelerating expansion== of the universe.
    
    - After the big bang, with the passage of time, matter was created.
    - These matters attract each other by the force of Gravitation because of which universe must have collapsed by now.
    - It means there must be some hidden energy to counter the attractive forces of gravitation.
    - This hidden energy is dark energy.
- Evidence
    
    - Supernovae explosion - rate of expansion of the universe is increasing
    - Cosmic microwave background (CMB)
      
    
 
- The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful ==particle accelerator== located at CERN, Switzerland.
- It was created to allow scientists to study the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces that govern them.
- The LHC is a 27-kilometer-long ring of superconducting magnets that accelerate protons to nearly the speed of light.

- Higgs boson - a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics that is thought to give other particles their mass. 
- The ==Universe== was a tiny dense mass 13.7 billion years ago.
- During that period, the temperature and density were infinite.
- An ==explosion== happens which ==led to cosmic inflation i==.e. expansion of the universe in the creation of space and time.
- This ==led to== an ==invisible but interactive Higgs field== appeared.
- Quarks (q) and Leptons (l) interacted with the Higgs field (h).
- ==Quark interacted more than Leptons with Higgs field and thus gain more mass than Leptons.==
- Then quarks interacted among themselves to give protons and neutrons.
- The Leptons in a similar sense gave electrons.
- The electron absorbed light because of which universe become opaque. This phase is called the "**Dark Ages".**
- Proton and electrons came together to form hydrogen.
- Electrons emit extra energy while revolving around protons in the form of gamma radiation. This causes a transparent universe.
- At this time, Nuclear fusion started and gives rise to Stars, Galaxies.
- Various elements also formed during that time like C, P, N & O, etc. which are precursors of DNA and forms life.

- Importance of Higgs Bosons:
    
    - ==Completing the Standard Model :== The Higgs boson is the last missing piece of the Standard Model of particle physics, which is our current understanding of the fundamental forces and particles that make up the universe.
    - Exploring Beyond the Standard Mode : 
- E=MC^2
- Light always travels in a straight line.
- The speed of light is maximum and No object in the universe can match the speed of light.
- The entire universe is sitting on an imaginary space-time fabric.
- Any object in the universe having mass and acceleration will warp or curbs space-time fabric.
- In the process of warping, they create ripples or disturbances in the universe.
- These ripples are called the Gravitational Waves (GW).
- These GW are too weak to be detected but major events like a merger of two black holes etc. can create comparatively stronger GWs that can be detected.
- Einstein = 1st person to give the concept on this theory of relativity.
    
- Atomic clocks are highly accurate timekeeping devices that are based on the principle that the ==natural oscillations of atoms==, such as ==cesium or rubidium==, have an extremely ==precise frequency==. This frequency is used to ==define== the ==second==, the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI).
    
    - Rubidium atomic clock in ==IRNSS==

- What is a second?
    
    - In the International System of Units (SI), a second is the base unit of time. It is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. - ![Atomic clock Timekeeping Accuracy Benefits Britann...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061809-33.gif) - How Atomic Clocks Work:
    
    - Atomic clocks work on the principle of measuring the vibrations or oscillations of atoms, which are inherently stable and consistent.
    - Atom Reservoir : Atomic clocks contain a reservoir of atoms . These atoms are typically in a gaseous form.
    - Microwave Resonance: The clock sends microwave radiation through the atom reservoir to match a specific energy transition in the atoms.
    - Feedback Loop: to adjust the frequency of the microwave radiation until it precisely matches the atom's resonant frequency.
    - Counting Oscillations:

- The ability of microorganisms like bacteria, or viruses to stop an anti-microbial medicine from working against it.
- It can occur naturally or through the misuse of drug therapies (incomplete course, self-medication without consultation, etc);
- Standard treatments become ineffective, the infection persists & it may spread to others.
 
Phage Therapy

##### **BLOOD**
            

**Blood groups**

- Antigens are present on the surface of RBCs.
- These antigens decide the type of blood.
- Corresponding to these, antibodies are found in plasma.
    
**Blood Transfusion concepts**

- It means giving the blood of 1 person to another.
- The donor has antigen and recipient has antibody.
- The antigen is something that stimulates the immune system.
- When it comes to our body, our body will produce antibodies to fight it off.
- An antigen on our RBCs is not an antigen for our body but it will be an antigen for someone else's body.
- This antigen activity will come into play when blood is donated from one person to another.
- At that time the antigen of the donor will activate the immune system of the recipient.
- Antibodies can not be produced against one's own antigen.
- That is why someone with blood group A can not produce antibody A.
- He will always produce antibodies B.

    - Correctio==n is a diverging or concave lens.==
      

**Electric current**
 
**Series and Parallel.**

- **Series:**
    
    - In the entire circuit, the same current flows.
    - If one device becomes non-operational, no current flows through the circuit.
- **Parallel:**
    
    - In the entire circuit, different current flows.
    - Failure of one appliance does not affect the entire circuit, and other appliances remain operational.
    
    - It is a device to save costly appliances in case of excess current flow or fluctuated voltage.
    - It is connected in series.
    - The melting point of the wire used in the fuse should be very low.
    - The resistance of the fuse should be very less.

**Fuse.**
 
**Heating effect of current.**

- When current is passed through a conductor, there is the heating of the appliance due to resistance.
- Here, the electrical energy is getting converted into heat energy.
- An alloy of Nickel and Chromium is used to intensify the heating.
- This property of the current is harnessed in devices like Iron, Geyser, Heater, etc.
 
**Chemical effect of current.**

- Solution = Solute + Solvent.
- The solution is of two types - Electrolytic (water) and non-electrolytic (distilled water).
- ==When current passes through an electrolytic solution==, it breaks into ions i.e. such solution allows passage or conduction of current.
- ==The non-electrolytic solution does not conduct electricity.== #remember-for-later
 
**Electroplating:**

- Ion is a charged particle - positive (cation) or negative (anion).
- Cations will move towards the negative electrode (Cathode).
- Anions will move towards the positive electrode (Anode).
- Electroplating is plating one metal with another.
- An anode is a metal to be deposited.
- The cathode is the metal on which anode metal is deposited.
- ![Jewelry and Gold Plating Problems The process Issu...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061826-40.jpeg) - **Applications of electroplating:**

    - Saving important appliances/ metals -
        
        - Zinc plating on iron = ==galvanization==; Zinc- Anode, Iron- Cathode
        - Chromium plating on Iron (Chrome plating); ==Chromium- Anode, Iron- Cathode.==
   

**Dynamo/Generator**

- This is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
 
**Motor**

- It is a device that ==converts electrical energy into mechanical energy==.
 
**Inverter**

- **Alternating current and Direct Current:**
    
    - AC is a fluctuating or changing current, whereas, DC is a constant current.
    - AC is used in transmission lines (from power stations to houses).
    - Household appliances like Air Conditioner, Fridge, etc. use AC.
    - The battery will always give DC.
    - Laptop, Plasma TV, Mobile, E-vehicles use DC.
- An **inverter** is a device that converts DC into AC.
 
**Magnetic effect of current.**

- When the current flows through the wire, a magnetic field is developed around it.
- If any iron rod or conductor is brought near the magnetic field, magnetism is developed in that iron rod.
- When the electric current is stopped, the magnetic property of the iron is also gone.
- This property of the current is used to develop **electromagnets**, which have many applications, for example, in electric devices like electric bells, telephone receivers, they are used to develop particle accelerators like large hadron colliders, Cyclotron, Betatron.

### **CHEMISTRY**

**MATTER**

- It has some mass and occupies some space and something that responds to gravity.
- **A different state of matter:**
    
    - **Solid -** molecules are tightly packed
    - **Liquid -**  molecules are loosely packed
    - **Gas -**  molecules are not packed
    - **Plasma-**
        
        - ==It is an ionized/charged gas.== #remember-for-later
        - If gas is put into strong electromagnetic field gas is converted into Plasma.
        - Plasma is found in stars, for example, Sun.
        - Plasma is also found in the interstellar medium.
        - Plasma also happens in fluorescent lamps.
        - It is also found in the ionosphere.
        - Like gas, plasma does not have a definite shape or volume unless enclosed in a container.
        - Unlike gas, plasma can form structures like beams and filaments.

**ATOM**

- Any matter is made up of Atoms, so atoms are nothing but a fundamental unit of matter.
- The central part is known as the nucleus
- In the nucleus, we have Neutron and Proton. 
    
    - ==Nucleons== are neutrons plus protons. 
        
        - Neutrons - Neutral or Zero charge. 
        - Protons - positively charged. 
- So, an atom is made up of Electrons and Nucleons.
      

**ISOTOPES**

- Isotopes are elements having th==e same atomic number but a different mass numbe==r or atomic mass. In other words, Isotopes have a same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.
- Sometimes, the mismatch of this kind may lead to radioactivity.
- Isotopes of Hydrogen = Hydrogen, Deuterium, Tritium.
 
**NUCLEAR PHYSICS**

- Study at the level of the nucleus.
- It is further subdivided into - nuclear fusion and nuclear fission.
- Fusion means addition.
    
**RADIOACTIVITY**

- It is a natural emission of high-energy radiation or nuclei from unstable elements or isotopes due to the disintegration of their atomic nuclei.
- These are of 3 types alpha, beta, and Gamma  - **Alpha decay:**
    
    - Alpha is a term used for the ==Helium nucleus.==
    - The Helium nucleus comes out of the parent nucleus.
    - It happens in bigger nuclei, for example, Uranium.
- **Beta-decay:**
    
    - occurs when, in a nucleus with too many protons or too many neutrons, one of the protons or neutrons is transformed into the other
    - ![Beta Decay Definition and Examples](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061827-41.png)
      
    
      

- **Gamma decay:** 
    
    - Gamma is a term used for high-energy radiation i.e. Gamma-ray.
    - Gamma-ray comes out of the parent nucleus.
    - It happens naturally due to an excited state, for example, the ==Barium== nucleus.
    - It can also happen after alpha-decay.
    - Radioactivity is measured by three counters = Geiger Muller counter; Scintillation counter; Semiconductor device.
![173 Types of Radioactivity Alpha Beta and Gamma De...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061829-42.jpeg)  
   

**NEUTRINO**

- A neutral subatomic particle with a mass close to zero and half-integral spin, rarely reacting with normal matter. Three kinds of neutrinos are known, associated with the electron, muon, and tau particle.
- Formed during both fission and fusion.
- Also formed naturally = Comic radiations when falling on nitrogen gives Pions, which further decays to Muons, which ultimately decays to the neutrino.
- Neutrinos are like the CCTV camera of the universe. 
    
    - Generally, they are chargeless.
    - Mass is almost zero.
    - They have lots of information and are found everywhere.
    - They are difficult to catch.
        
        - To catch we need to slow them down, likely by passing through a large freshwater body (Lake Baikal)
 
**HALF-LIFE**

- Radioisotopes decay at a constant rate.
- The time required for half of the original isotope to reduce to its half is called the half-life. 
- Every living organism has both C-12 (stable), and C-14 (radioactive) carbons in them. 
- Carbon 14 being unstable, goes for beta decay. 
- This decay is compensated by the nutrition of the organism, because of which, Carbon-12 to Carbon-14 ratio in the body reflects the environmental level. But when an organism dies this ratio is no longer the same.
- This is the difference is exploited by the researchers to know the age of any fossil.
 
**CORROSION**

- Also known as rusting.
- It is actually the decay of metal.
- It is the formation of the oxide layer on the outer surface of the metal.
- For corrosion to happen, the requirement is = Moisture and air.
- To avoid corrosion, galvanization is done.
 
**ALLOTROPES.**

- Some chemical elements are known to exist in ==two or more different forms bec==ause the atoms are ==bonded== together in different manners.
- ==Allotropes of Carbon = Graphite, Diamond, Fullerene.==
 
**PERIODIC TABLE**

- The periodic table is an arrangement of the elements in a particular fashion like according to their atomic number.
- Elements are categorized into Metals, Non-metals, and Metalloids.
- Most of the elements found in nature are metals (75%).
- Metalloids are the least found.
   

**HALOGEN FAMILY**

- They are not rare as the name suggests, rather their abundance may be more than 200 times the total average presence of copper, gold, etc. in the earth's crust.
- ==They are called rare because it is difficult to extract them in their purest form and also their concentration in ores is in traces.== #remember-for-later
- They are generally traded in the form of ==oxides== and hence, called rare earth oxides.

### **COSMIC PHYSICS**
 
**Gravitation**
 
**Escape velocity**

- The gravitational field of the earth - the gravitational pull of the earth acts within this range.

• It is the minimum velocity required by an object to overcome the gravitational pull of the earth.  
• Escape velocity for the earth is ==11.2 km/sec.==  
**Stars**  
• Starts are lump or collection of dust and gas have their own light.  
**Planet**  
**Three criteria:**  
• It should revolve around the sun.  
• It should have enough gravity to gain a spherical shape.  
• A planet should also have enough gravity that is able to clear its own surroundings - Pluto fails this criterion.  
**Asteroids**  
• Rocky objects, revolve around the sun, found **between Mars and Jupiter.**  
• Some asteroids are found beyond Jupiter also, known by the name **Trojan**.

![What is asteroid beltkuiper belt oort cloud](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061831-43.jpeg)  

• Some of the asteroids are also found beyond Mars, known as **Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).**  
• NASA is studying an asteroid named **Bennu**:  
• **Bennu** is of moderate size.  
• 1/600 chances are there that it might collide with the earth.
 
• **Hayabusa-2 of Japan**: Name of the asteroid- **Ryugu**.  
• JAPAN'S Hayabusa mission has brought some rocks from Ryugu.  
**Satellite**  
• celestial bodies that revolve around the planet.  
**Comet**  
• It has a ==nucleus and a tail.==  
• It also revolves around the sun.  
• There are many gases, dust, and ice in the nucleus.  
• They are flammable gases like ammonia, methane.  
• Comets are evolved from the Kuiper belt (short-period comets) and the Oort cloud(long-period comets)

![ESA Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud in context](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061832-44.jpeg) ![The evolution of comets in the Oort cloud and Kuip...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061839-45.jpeg)

• When they reach near the Sun, the tail develops, as these gases catch fire.
 
**Meteoroids**  
• **Meteoroids**:  
• Chunk or part of either asteroids or ==comets(mostly).==  
• Most of them ==vanish in the outer atmospher==e of the earth.  
• **Meteors**:

• They are meteoroids entering the earth's inner atmosphere.  
• Also called ==Shooting start==s - They show different colours due to the presence of different minerals in them.

- ==Geminids==

Annual meteor shower  
Unlike most meteor showers they originate from ==asteroid==.  
They are visible throughout night sky  
**Meteorites:**  
• meteors that survives through earth atmosphere and r==each the earth's surface.==

- They collide with ground

• They are responsible for the extinction of dinosaurs.
    
**The life cycle of a star**  
**Small Star:**  
• Nebula of a star = womb of a star (Dust + Hydrogen gas).  
• The dimension of ==womb = 1 to 10 light-years.==  
• Every phase of a star is for billions of years.  
• Dust particles have a mass and they try to attract each other by a force of gravitation.  
• The stellar energy counters the effect of gravitational force, which leads to the formation of **Protostar**.  
• In Protostar, **nuclear reactions/fusion** is just started.  
• ==Nuclear fusion will intensify which gives the== **Main Sequence Star (Youth).**
 
• **Sun is a Main Sequence Star.**  
• Nearly more than 90% of the fuel (H2) is over.  
• Star burns remaining Hydrogen more quickly, which leads to the expansion of the star, which is called as **Red Giant (Mature).**  
• Hydrogen is then almost over, but then Helium becomes the fuel.  
• Helium then reacts with H, He, Be, C.  
• Helium, after billions of years, is also almost over.  
• Star collapses at the Carbon Oxygen core.  
• It gives **Planetary Nebula** Collection of dust + gas, and ==White Dwarf (==Luminous high dense mass)/ Fossil star.  
• After billions of years, **Planetary Nebula acts as a nebula for a new star.**
 
**Big Star:**  
• The dimension of a ==womb= Greater than 10 light-years.==  
• The stellar energy counters the effect of gravitational force, which leads to the formation of Protostar.  
• In Protostar, nuclear reactions/fusion is just started.  
• Nuclear fusion will intensify which gives the Main Sequence Star (Youth).  
• Nearly more than 90% of the fuel (H2) is over.  
• Star burns remaining Hydrogen more quickly, which leads to the expansion of the star, which is called as Red Super Giant (Mature).  
• Hydrogen is then almost over, but then Helium becomes the fuel.  
• Helium then reacts with H, He, Be, C, Oxygen, Silicon, Fe (Iron).  
• Helium, after billions of years, is also almost over.  
• **Star collapses at the** **Iron core wh****ich giv****es Supernova a****n explosion.**
 
• ==Medium size star gives a== **Neutron sta****r**, whereas, ==Big size star gives a== **Blackhole.**
 ![Life Cycle of a Star Stages Facts and Diagrams](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061841-46.jpeg)   
**CHANDRASHEKHAR LIMIT**  
• If the mass of the core is ==less than 1.44 than th==at of the mass of the Sun, it will die as **White Dwarf**.  
• If the mass of the core is ==less than 3*Mass of Sun or greater than 1.44== of the mass of Sun, it will die as **Neutron Star****.**  
• If the mass of the core is ==greater than 3*Mass of the Sun,== **Blackhole** will be the final stage.
 
**WHITE DWARF**  
• It is formed when a small star collapses at the ==Carbon, Oxygen core.==  
• This collapse is so intense tha==t every electron in each atom reaches the first orbit== due to which volume decreases and hence, density increases.  
• This state in quantum mechanics is called 'Degenerate Gas'.  
• White dwarfs are glowing dense objects in the universe without any fusion mechanism. 
 
**NEUTRON STAR**  
• These are formed due to the death of medium stars.  
• When a star collapses at the ==iron core,== a==ll electrons in every atom enter the nucleus==, ==where they feed upon the protons to give neutrons.==  
• Due to this ==only neutrons are left== in the stars and that's why they are known as neutron stars.  
• They are ==incredibly fast spinning== cause the emission of beams of electromagnetic radiations.  
• These are also called ==Pulsar== because they accelerate any particle entering their magnetic field.

- ==All pulsars are neutron stars, but conversely all neutron stars are not necessarily pulsars.== #remember-for-later
 
**SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION**  
• These are extreme events in the cosmic realm where a huge amount of energy is emitted and also elements heavier than iron like uranium, Gold, Silver, etc are formed during the Supernova explosion. 
 
**BLACKHOLE**

- • It is a very big object in the universe from which even light can not come out.
- • This is because of the infinite pull of the black hole.
- • The gravitation is so much because the entire ==mass== of the black hole is ==concentrated== ==at== a one-dimensional point called ==Singularity==.
- • Any object falling in a black hole loses its dimensions and attain one dimension or singularity, this process is called Spaghettification.
- • These are dead remains of a big star that warp or curves space-time infinitely.
- ==Schwarzschild Radius - event horizon radius. Escape velocity = speed of light==

• Pluto is falling in the Kuiper belt  
• These Rocky objects are much bigger than the asteroid belt  
• As the distant edges of Kuiper belt icy objects are found known as Oort cloud.  
• The size of the Oort cloud may be bigger than the mountains on earth.  
• Oort cloud also marks the outermost layer of our solar system.
 
**HELIOSPHERE & HYDROGEN WALL**  
• Solar winds emanating from the Sun forms the shape of a bubble that extends beyond the major planets. This bubble is the ==Heliosphere==  
• It is unable to penetrate an area of hydrogen concentrated area known as Hydrogen wall.  
• This Hydrogen walls also marks the end of our Solar system
 
**INTERSTELLAR**  
• It is the unclaimed area of the universe  
• It is the part of space (unclaimed) that exists between the stars. (Vacant space)  
• It is a hard vacuum i.e. the presence of dust, gases, plasma (Ionised gases), cosmic radiations.

• Anti Matter is just the Opposite of Matter. It shares all the properties with the matter ==but== has either o==pposite charge o==r subatomic characteristics.  
• Both matter and antimatter formed during Big Bang, but today antimatter are rare in our galaxy. But they can be found in other stars and galaxies.  
• When matter and antimatter come in contact with each other they annihilate flashing a lot of energy.  
• For example - ==Positron==, ==antiquark==, antineutrino, antihydrogen, etc. 
 
**Dark Matter:**

**HIGGS BOSON THEORY**
   

**THEORY OF RELATIVITY (Einstein)**
 
**EINSTEIN-ROSEN BRIDGE (WORMHOLES)**

- Blackholes warp space & time infinitely.
- In this ==process of warping, it can bring two points in the universe closer to each other.==
- In other words, it can act as a bridge that reduces the physical distance between two points.
- Wormholes can make inter-galaxy travel possible.
- But at this point in time, traveling through wormholes is not possible as they are very small.
 
**GRAVITATIONAL LENSING**

- Massive matters like galaxies, black holes, etc. create ==stronger gravitational fields which cause light rays to pass close to that matter.==
- In this process, ==light is slightly bent or refocused somewhere else.==
- This phenomenon also acts as a ==cosmic telescope.==
