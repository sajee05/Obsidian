- **Outer Space** 
    
    - Earth and Atmospheric segregation in troposphere, stratosphere, Mesosphere, and Exosphere.
    - Karman Line ==defines Outer space==. It is located 100 km above the surface of the Earth and is considered the starting point of outer space.
        
        - ![The layers of the earths atmosphere and the Karman...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604235012-3.jpeg)
      
    - There is an international treaty called Outer Space Treaty, 1967, an intergovernmental treaty, determines space activities in outer space including the moon, and other celestial bodies.

- **UNOOSA**
    
    - The ==United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)== works to help all countries, especially developing countries, access and leverage the benefits of space to accelerate sustainable development.
    - It works toward this goal through a variety of activities that cover all aspects related to space, from space law to space applications.
    - **Global Commons : Examples:** Space, internet, oceans, Air, Antarctic, and the Arctic, etc.

- **Outer Space Treaty, 1967**
    
    - Defines that outer space is the common heritage of mankind. There is no territorial and sovereignty claim by any nation. Outer space belongs to humanity.
    - Outer space should be used for peaceful purposes only.
    - Outer space should be prohibited from weaponization.
    - Outer space should not be used for weapons of mass destruction (WOMD).
    - Outer space shall not be contaminated.
    - Astronauts are the ambassadors of mankind and they should always work for the welfare of mankind. Any astronauts coming from any country will always work for humankind.

- **Launch Vehicle**
    
    - A launch vehicle or a rocket is a type of propulsion system to launch a spacecraft, space probe, and crew module into designated orbits in outer space.
    - There are various types of launch vehicles designed and developed by space agencies worldwide.
    - We can broadly classify these vehicles into two categories: Expandable Launch Vehicle (ELV) and Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV).
        
        - The examples of ELV are the GSLV, and PSLV, Vostok, Long March, Dragon (Space X)
        - The example of RLV are Discovery, Challengers, Endeavor, Atlantis, Colombia, Soyuz (Roskosmos), Shenzhou (CNAS), Falcon (Space X)
    - A launch vehicle consists of the ==Engine (Propulsion system), fuel, and Payload.==

- **Engine (Propulsion system)**
    
    - A launch vehicle engine uses propellant (fuel) which is burnt using the oxidizer to generate high thrust exhaust.
    - There are various types of propulsion engines. These are ==Non-Air Breathing System, Air Breathing Air System, and Cryogenic engine==
    - A non-Air Breathing System uses an ==oxidizer== to burn the fuel.
    - Air Breathing Air System uses oxygen gas from the atmospheric air to burn the fuel. ==RAMJET and SCRAMJET a==re examples of these types of systems.
        
        - ==SCRAMJET is a special type of RAMJET. I==t takes in atmospheric air with a high velocity of 2 mac to 5 mac by a nozzle. To burn the fuel to generate exhaust gases producing ==hypersonic speed==.
            
            - **This technology has the following benefits**
                
                - It saves money in terms of the manufacturing of the oxidizer
                - It helps in reducing the overall weight of the rocket thereby it can launch a higher payload.
                - It can provide hypersonic speed.

- **Benefits:** 
    
    - **Sustainability:** Availability of fuel for a long time.
        
        - It is an eco-friendly technology.
        - It has high storage of the fuel in liquefied form
        - It provides high thrust.
        - Challenges with technology
        - High combustible nature of the hydrogen
        - Maintenance of extremely low temperature.
        - It is an expensive technology.

- **Fuel (Propellant)**  
    
    - It could be of two types that is solid fuel and liquid fuel.
      
    - **Solid Fuel:**
        
        - ==Hydroxy Tetra Poly Butadiene (HTPB).== In PSLV and GSLV we use this fuel. It has advantages such as it is easy to store and transport. No risk of leakage and inflammation.
        - It has disadvantages such as heavy and bulkiness. It also has non-uniform burning.

- **Liquid Fuel**
    
    - ==(UDMH + H2O4) Unsymmetric Dimethyl Hydrazine.==
    - **Benefits:** It occupies less space and is lightweight. It helps in uniform burning. It is easy to control the switch on and off process.
    - **Disadvantages**: It is highly inflammable, thus it needs a special type of storage. It is corrosive in nature. It has a special container to store such fuel.

- **Payload**
    
    - Which is launched by the Launch Vehicle. It could be satellites, Crew Module, spacecraft itself, Astronomical telescope, etc.

- **SSLV**
    
    - S==mall Satellite Launch Vehicle -== ideal for the on-demand, quick turn-around launch of small satellites.
    - ==All-solid three-stage vehicle== #remember-for-later

- **PSLV and GSLV** 

- **Orbit**
    
    - An orbit is an imaginary path by a celestial body or artificial or man-made satellite.
    - Orbital speed : The speed/velocity at which the satellite moves in its orbit.
    - Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation: ==Fg = GMm/R2 (square)==
    - **Centripetal Force:** Whenever a body moves in a circular path, a force acts towards the centre.
        
        - ==Fc= MV2 Square)/R==
            
            - Centripetal force for the satellite is provided by gravity.
        - MV2/R = GMm/R2 (Square)
        - V2= GM/R
        - **Vorbit = √GM/R**
            
            - The orbital speed of the satellite does not depend upon the mass of the satellite but depends on the distance orbit from the earth. When an orbit is near to the earth, a satellite moves fast with higher orbital velocity.

- **Classification of the Orbits**
    
    - Classification based on the shape of the Orbit. It could be elliptical and circular orbit. Apogee (farthest point), perigee (Nearest point). Distance of the satellite change. In a circular orbit, the distance will remain constant, thus the orbital speed as well. ==Geostationary Orbit has a circular orbit.==
    - On the basis of the revolution of Satellites around the earth: It could be of two types are Geo Synchronous Orbit and Sun Synchronous Orbit. The movement of the satellite is synchronized with respect to the rotation of the earth. It is an elliptical orbit and it will be in the equatorial plane.
      
    - **Sun-Synchronous**: The satellite will be on the ==polar plane.== It will be always the Sun Synchronous Polar Orbit. Remote sensing satellites follow this orbital path. The movement of the satellite is synchronized with respect to the revolution of the earth around the sun. It is a ==circular orbit in the polar plane.==
      
    - **Geostationary orbit:** It is a circular orbit. It lies at the equatorial orbit. It is used by the communication satellites. The distance of the orbit is 35780 Km. It is called stationary because the satellite's position remains fixed with respect to any position on the earth. The orbital speed of the satellite matches the rotational speed of the earth. ==Direction should be west to east. The orbital time is 24 hours.==

    - Superfluid: quantum processors need to be ==very cold (==1/100 of Zeroth kelvin)
    - Superposition - ability of qubits to exists in multiple states simultaneously as a consequence of the wave-particle duality of matter.
        
        - particle can exist in a superposition of spin-up and spin-down states, which means that it is neither fully spin-up nor fully spin-down, but is in a combination of both states.
    - **Entanglement** - ==state== of one particle ==is intimately linked== to the state of the other particle even if separated by large distance.
        
        - Particles are intertwined in such a way that measuring the state of one particle instantly affects the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This is known as **non-locality** and it is a fundamental feature of entanglement.
    - **Quantum coherence** - it contemplates a situation where an object's wave property is split in two, and the two waves coherently interfere with each other in such a way to form a single state that is superimposition of two states.

### **Defence Technology**
   

**Classification of Missiles**

- Depending on the environment from which the missile is launched and the environment in which the target is to be found, guided missile systems are classified as follows: 
 
**Ballistic Missile**

- It follows a sub-orbital/projectile path.
- It follows the law of gravity.
- It has two phases: 
    
    - Exo-atmospheric,
    - Endo-atmospheric.
        
        - For E.g.: the Prithvi Series, Agni Series of missiles.
- They are long-range missiles.
- Advantages : Can be used for various ranges (short and long ranges).
    
    - Fuel consumption is less.
    - Require fuel only when it is going against gravity.
 
**Disadvantages of Ballistic Missiles:** 

- More suitable for fixed targets.
- Can be intercepted by Radar, and destroyed in the air by anti-ballistic missiles (e.g. by S-400).

**Quasi ballistic missile**

- Somewhat manoeuvrability, low trajectory
- Missile - ==Pralay==
    
    - Part of प्रहार missile program

**Cruise Missile**

- It follows a sea-skimming trajectory.
- It moves close to the surface, maintaining a distance from the surface.
- For E.g.: India-Russia’s ==Brahmos, Nirbhaya.==
- Advantages : Speed and manoeuvrability are high.
    
    - The inability of normal radars to intercept it.
- Guided to the target in air, land, water surface accurately.
 
**Disadvantages of Cruise Missiles:** 

- Suitable for short and medium ranges.
- Consumes more fuel.
- Have lighter payloads.

### **Nuclear Science and Technology**
 
**Fission reaction:**

- In a fission reaction, the heavy nucleus of an atom ==disintegrates==/breaks down, into two or more lighter daughter nuclei, with the release of energy.
    
    - For E.g. of Uranium.
- For example, the isotope of Uranium, i.e. U-235 captures slow neutrons and produces daughter nuclei of Barium and Krypton and 3 neutrons.
    
    - ==UBaKr-235-144-89 (====सुभाकर====)==
    - ![What is Nuclear Fission Definition Examples Differ...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604235046-17.png)
      
    
    - We don't control fission reaction, e.g. Atom Bombs, weapons, it has a lot of energy.
    
    - Nuclear power generation
    - In a nuclear reactor
 
**Uncontrolled Fission (Chain reaction)**  
**Controlled Fission Reaction (controlled chain reaction)**
 
**Fusion reaction:**

- Two lighter nuclei of atoms combine together to form a stable heavy nucleus.
- ==They require very high temperatures, hence is called a thermo-nuclear reaction.== #remember-for-later
- ![Nuclear Fusion Definition Occurrence Examples Appl...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604235048-18.png) - For E.g. inside the Sun.
    
    - Fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form Helium.
- **Uncontrolled Fusion Reaction:** 
    
    - It happens in Sun/Stars, the source of energy is an uncontrolled fusion reaction.
    - Also, Hydrogen Bomb is an uncontrolled fusion bomb. (Plutonium based fission is used to increase temperature, and then hydrogen is used to combine to produce helium)
- **Controlled** **Fusion** **Reaction:** 
    
    - It is possible by the use of controlled reactors. For example: ==Plasma research in a Tokamak reactor==.
    - **Tokamak Reactor:**
        
        - It is a ==Toroidal== shaped Reactor to ==generate very high-temperature== plasma inside the reactor vessel.
        - It generates a very high temperature inside the Reactor by ==using ‘magnetic induction’.==
        - Strong magnets are used.

    - Fuel: Th-232 and Pu-239 or Th-232 and U-233.
    - Thorium itself is not a fissile material, it needs to be first converted (U233) by transmutation in a reactor fuelled by other fissile material.
- **Chinese development**
    
    - Fourth-generation nuclear plant - high-temperature reactors cooled by gas instead of pressurized water.

**Nuclear Fuel Cycle**

- The nuclear fuel cycle is a series of processes and related facilities to generate nuclear power
    
    - It has two divisions - Front end and backend 
        
        - The front end of this cycle includes mineral exploration, mining and processing of the ore and fuel fabrication 
        - Reprocessing of the spent fuel and management of nuclear waste hence form the backend of the cycle 
        - Heavy water production and use is an auxiliary stage of the cycle 
        - Any country which has developed the entire fuel cycle is capable of using nuclear technology not only for power generation but also enrichment of uranium for military purpose  - **Context**:
    
    - ==International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)== is the nuclear watchdog which is based in Vienna 
    - Iran Nuclear Programme and the issue of UN's Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
    - NPT allows peaceful use of Nuclear technology 
        
        - Also, prohibits of keeping weapons and stockpiles by members countries except for P5
    - India is not a member of NPT along with Pakistan, Israel, etc 
- **Stages**:
    
    - 1==. Survey and exploration - Atomic Minerals Directorate (AMD), located in Hyderabad== which comes under the Department of Atomic Energy
    - 2. Mining and milling - ==Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL), Jaduguda== 
    - 3. Enrichment - Ultra-centrifugation  
    - 4. Fabrication (Fuel Rods) - ==Nuclear Fuel Complex, Hyderabad== 
    - 5. Nuclear Power Generation -  ==Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL)==
    - Production of Heavy Water (D2O) - ==Heavy Water Board, Mumbai==
    - 6. Reprocessing of spent Fuel - Un-used uranium and radio-isotopes are extracted; unused uranium is again sent for enrichment 
    - 7. Nuclear Waste Management ==- Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC)== 
        
        - Here, storage of nuclear waste in a container and dumped under the earth in a deep geological formation 
   

**Nuclear Safeguard**: It refers to the non-diversion of Nuclear Peaceful Program into military Program
 
**Criticality -** ==Condition in which nuclear fuel sustains a fission chain reaction.==

- A reactor is said to be at a critical stage when each fission releases a sufficient number of neutrons to sustain the ongoing series of nuclear reactions.
 
**3 Stages of Nuclear Programme**:

- **Stage I - Pressured Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR)**
    
    - It is a nuclear power reactor, commonly using low enriched Natural Uranium as its fuel and ==heavy water as its coolant and moderator==
    - The heavy water coolant is kept under pressure, allowing it to be heated to higher temperatures without boiling, which passed through another chamber to generate steam 
    - The steam runs a turbine, generator, etc to produce electricity 
    - ==The PHWR produce 700 MW of electricity==  #remember-for-later
    - ==NPCIL== operates such reactors in India in different nuclear parks 
    - The spent fuel is reprocessed to extract Uranium-238 and Plutonium for the Second Stage of the Nuclear Programme 
   

- **Stage 3 - Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR)**:
    
    - Thorium utilisation is a long term core objective of the Indian Nuclear Power Programme for providing energy security on a sustainable basis 
    - BARC has developed AHWR to utilise huge stocks of thorium found in India 
    - AHWR is a vertical pressure tube reactor capable of generating 300 MW of electricity 
    - It uses ==heavy water as a moderator but is cooled by normal water== 
    - ==The fuel consists of partly thorium mixed with plutonium and partly thorium mixed with uranium== 
 
**Other applications of Nuclear Technology**

- **1. Agriculture and Food Processing:**
    
    - High Yield Varieties (HYV) of Crop ==(Trombay Crop Varieties==)

        - Low dose and high dose of radiations to process various types of foods with following benefits:
            
            - It prevents sprouting in tubers 
            - Increase shelf-life of food items e.g. reservation of Litchi, Mango, etc 
            - Germicidal effect 
            - Prevents spoilage of foods
        - Negative Aspect: Irradicated food impacts health - certification and labelling
