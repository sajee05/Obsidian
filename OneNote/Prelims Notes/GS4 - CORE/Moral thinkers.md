- Socrates is considered to be the basic founder of the modern western philosophy 
- His perspectives were further refined by Plato

- The ideal state should consist of persons with such virtues  
- These virtues are indicative of or reflective of the nature of the soul 
- Soul has 3 parts - reason, spirit, and appetite

- On the basis of the reference/context, consequential theories can be broadly classified into 3 types:

- 2. Ethical Altruism
- 3. Principle of utilitarian 
- Under ethical egoism, an action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favourable than unfavourable only to the agent who is performing the action 
- In the case of ethical altruism, an action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favourable than unfavourable to everyone, except the agent who is performing the action 
- In the case of the principle of utilitarianism, an action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favourable than unfavourable to everyone 

**Principle of utilitarianism**: (5:18 PM)

- The perspective of John Rawls, Jeremy Bentham and JS Mill 
- **John Rawls - Theory of Justice:**
- It is based upon 2 fundamental principles:
- 1. Every person should have the right to liberty in correspondence with the other individuals 
- 2. The socio-economic positions should be for everyone's advantage and open to all
- These two fundamental principles can guarantee a just and morally acceptable society 
- John Rawls gives importance to the distribution of the public resources 
- The theory of justice propounded by John Rawls gives importance to equal treatment for all in equal circumstances and therefore under unequal circumstances, the treatment should be unequal so that justice can be made to become more justiciable
- Rawls gives importance to the viel of ignorance 
- According to John Rawls, the policymakers should be  ignorant about their socio-economic positions, so that the policies are  decided in accordance with the larger interest of the society rather than the specific interest of the select groups in the society that will make the policies become more impartial and achieve the objective of the larger public interest 
- **According to Jeremy Bentham**, the morality of human action can be examined on the basis of the calculation of the consequences of each action on the case to case basis to examine whether that action is morally right or wrong 
- This aspect is referred to as Act Utilitarian
- Bentham also proposed that we also calculate pleasure and pain as the only consequences to decide whether the conduct or action is moral  
- **According to JS Mill**, the consequences of human action are examined in accordance with the moral rules which are adopted on the basis of being more favourable than unfavourable for everyone 

**Duty Theory**: (5:57 PM)

- As human beings, we have certain obligations to ourselves, to others and to God 
- Such obligations are considered to be binding 
- According to Kant, duty should be performed for the sake of duty irrespective of its consequences 
- Kant gives importance to the Categorical Imperative (Unconditional Command) 
- A categorical imperative is considered to be universal moral law that applies to all persons and mankind 
- It has no reference to any external end rather it is derived by the direction of the will itself 
- According to Kant, the right action should satisfy two conditions:
- 1. The action must be in accordance with the moral law which has been derived or revealed on the basis of wisdom or intellect 
- 2. The agent should perform with respect to pure regard to the moral law 
- Kant is not supportive of hypothetical imperatives which refers to the conditional command 
- To realise an end, one must act in a particular manner 
- The laws which are considered to be the means to other ends are in the nature of hypothetical imperatives 
- According to Kant, Human beings end in themselves and therefore, they should never be treated as means to serve the interest of others 
- Every human being is rational with his own value and dignity and therefore every human being should be respected because of his own values 
- Duties are considered to be co-relative with the rights
- Rights are considered to be justified and claimed against other person's behaviour 
- Rights and duties can be considered to be the two sides of the same coin and therefore rights and duties are inter-dependent 
- The mutual interdependency between the rights and duties can be examined on the basis of certain examples, (illustration provided) etc 
- Right to life, liberty and to look for happiness are important aspects 
- Moral rights are three important features - such rights are natural, universal and applicable to equally 
- Such right cannot be transferred as its once own moral right, etc 

**Max Webber**: (6:57 PM)

- Power refers to the process of exercise of the influence 
- When this power becomes legitimate then it is referred to as authority 
- The legal authority has been considered to be rational and ethics is based on the premise of rationality 
- Webber mentions various features of bureaucracy on the basis of legal and rational authority, 
- The features are:
- 1. Rules and regulations 
- 2.  Merit system of recruitment 
- 3.  Money salary 
- 4. Sphere of competence 
- 5. Impersonality 
- 6. Neutrality 
- 7. Written documents 
- Every law is considered to be the codification of moral values and therefore the compliance of laws also indicates the adherence to the moral values 
- Rules and regulations provide the basis for objectivity, impartiality and non-partisan attitude on the part of those working for the bureaucracy 
- The merit system of recruitment ensures objectivity and facilitates the achievement or pursuance of the public interest rather than political interest and thereby it helps to promote integrity in the working of the civil servants 
- Money salary brings about more consistency and uniformity in the payment and thereby more satisfaction and motivation to the public officials and thereby helps to promote effectiveness and efficiency 
- A sphere of competence helps to prevent the misuse of the discretion to be exercised by the public officials 
- Impersonality ensures that a public official or Civil servant works in accordance with the wishes or the preferences of the public rather than being guided by his personal value system 
- The concept of neutrality helps to ensure, political impartiality and a non-partisan attitude in the working of the civil servants 
- Therefore civil servants are not expected to be committed to the ideology of the political party in power 
- On the basis of written communication, there can be better accountability of the public officials which itself is one of the important components of ethical governance.
- Webber's Bureactic Model gives importance to ethical imperatives in the bureaucratic behaviour 
- Also, the separation of public and private resources is o of the important feature 
- This model corresponds to the perspective provided by Kautilya 
- However, Kautilya's perspective is more pragmatic and practical, etc
