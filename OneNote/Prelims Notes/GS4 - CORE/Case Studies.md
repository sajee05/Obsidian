# Ethics Case Study Class 01
 
**Case Studies:**   
**Ethical Dilemma: (17:31)**

- When people have to choose between morally correct choices. 
- And presented choices are not unambiguously right or wrong. 
- **To approach Case Studies, the following are useful:** 
- One should be able to take decisions.
- Choosing between various competing values.
- Choices must be explainable.

**Public Trust: (18:02)**

- People have appointed governments.
- And a governance system has been created by the government.
- Public trust gives legitimacy to the government.

**Structure of a Case Study’s Answer: (19:14)**

- **Facts of the case:** 
- Identify the facts of the Case.
- **Stakeholders:** 
- Identify the stakeholders and their interests.
- The first stakeholder is the State, which is represented by the young Civil Servant, the Decision-maker.
- Second stakeholder: Young civil servant against whom the complaint has been logged. (To prove the innocence).
- Third Stakeholder: Mafia, the musclemen, corrupt office staff. (to continue illegal mining, and to exploit the tribals).
- Fourth Stakeholder: Tribal people. 
- Identify if there are any conflicts between the interests of the stakeholders.
- **Interests:** 
- The interest of the State is to prevent illegal mining. 
- The interest of the public (tribals) vs. Personal interest (musclemen).
- Identifying the ethical dilemma (value vs. value).
- **Possible Courses of Actions.** 
- To identify the course of action.
- The course of action must be argumentatively presented.
- That is, it must argue not just the demerits or reasons for not choosing the rejected courses of action, but also identify the possible demerits of the chosen course of action.
- Once you identify the demerits, then you can work to address them either in the medium term or long term.
- **Conclusion:** 
- My actions courage, perseverance, commitment to constitutional values, etc. 

**Make a list of values: (19:48)**

- From PYQP.
- Values like honesty, and integrity, for example, can be studied.
- Examples can be written.
- Identify ethical dilemmas from previous years.
- Nolan Committee values, etc. 
- Examples must be 2 liners at maximum.

Topic for the next class: **Specific case studies.**
 
# Ethics Case Study Class 02
 
**A brief overview of the class** **(5:06 PM)**  
**Introduction**

- Write the reason behind the questions being asked. Such as current Affairs etc

**Case study-2 (5:20 PM) (Refer to question projected on the board in the class)**

- **Introduction**-answer can be started with the character of Indian bureaucracy, post retired jobs, and potential conflict of interest between earlier hob and post-retirement jobs. Mandatory cooling of the period after retirement for those who were in a regulatory organization or the government system
- **Conflict of interest**
- Performance of public duty will be compromised because of personal interest.
- Real conflict of interest (it’s the visible conflict of interest at present)
- Apparent conflict of interest (hidden conflict of interest that may arise in the future or some stakeholders see such hidden conflict of interest). It’s about raising the suspicion about a decision may not be taken fairly by the retired senior manager.
- **Option a-**do not accept the assignment as it will lead to a breach of confidentiality
- **Merit**- avoids potential conflict of interest and prevention of cognitive dissonance (feeling of a discrepancy between action and wisdom)
- **Demerit**- it shows an inability to take decisions or running from responsibility
- **Option b**-do not lead the team but guide them from outside
- **Merit-** Expertise can be used for the bidding
- **Demerit-** false addresses of cognitive dissonance, breach of confidentiality.
- **Option c**-Accept to lead the team and use your expertise to bidding the contract
- **Merit**- ability to use expertise, commitment to present employer.
- **Demerit**-potential conflict of interest
- **Option d _** Resignation
- **Demerit- a** sign of weakness, inability to take a decision

**Case study 3** **(6:10 PM)**

- **Introduction-\>** Write the context.
- Option a-\> As the process is ongoing so MLA requests will not be entertained. will explore other options to ensure Widow gets a job somewhere
- Option b-\>consult with senior and check any precedent regarding such appointment. If there is any precedent then will appoint her on compassionate grounds.
- Option c-_ if there is a precedent then an appointment can be made.

**Case study 4-** **(6:46 PM)**

- Start with an answer with the idea of rule of law will be implemented. There should not be any compromise on that. In compliance with SC guidelines, the religious structure has to be removed.
- Now prepare a plan with the consultation of all stakeholders to implement the decision taken as per SC guidelines

**Case study 9** **(7:23 PM)**

- As the government information required to take the decision is wider.
- So, in such cases, the government has to take systemic decisions not based on personal opinions or impositions by a person such as MLA.
- Comply with the law such SC allows women entry.

**Case study 8** **(7:32 PM)**

- Person can be suspended pending the inquiry
- Greater loss of public trust.
- Lack of integrity so the action will be taken as per the law.

**The topic of the Next class-** case studies continued.
   

# Ethics Case Study Class 03
 
**A brief overview of Moral Thinkers (5:16 PM):**  
**Ethical Judgement:**

- Ethics are needed to ascertain if any activity is right or wrong.
- The reason for the rightness or wrongness is essentially ethics.
- Certain thinkers have given their views on the method and standards of the processes.

**Case 6: Abortion:**  
**It is wrong because:**

- If it is on the basis of gender (female foeticide).
- It can violate religious morality.
- It is against the right of life of a child.
- It is against medical ethics if there is no medical reason.
- **Utilitarianism perspective:** It is wrong as it leads to the death of one person.
- **Kantian/Deontological perspective**- It is wrong as sacrificing life for personal gain is a selfish decision. It is essentially using the fetus’ life as means.
-  **Aristotelian/Virtue-based perspective**- It is wrong because it does not reflect courage. Life must be virtuous and courage is the highest virtue

**It is right because:**

- In the cases of complications like fetal abnormalities.
- In cases of an unwanted child due to rape, poverty(**Utilitarian** perspective can also be used here as aborting one life might increase the happiness of the family which did not have the means to raise the child).
- Unwanted pregnancy due to contraceptive failure.
- It gives the woman the right over her body(**Right-based** ethics).

From an exam point of view, we are **not supposed** to get into the **rightness or wrongness.**

- It is more important to get to the philosophical basis of each argument/ school of thought.
- Here, in this case, a very important question is when does life/consciousness start in the fetus.

**Who gets the flute?**

- Let us assume that **X** asked **Y** to manufacture a flute for himself, in return for a payment.
- After the flute is made, **A, B** & **C** approach Y with their arguments:-

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Person**|**Argument**|
|**A:**|I know how to play the flute and hence deserve th flute rightfully. (**Right-Based**ethics)|
|**B:**|I am willing to pay the maximum amount. With the money, more flutes can be made, and hence, more people will be happy. **(Utilitarianism)**|
|**C:**|I don’t play the flute, but I need it for begging and this can be my only source of income. (**Humanitarian perspective)**|

- There is also the argument of **X** that he had asked Y to produce the flute.
- None of the above four claims are unreasonable

The schools of thought deal mainly with **ideal/extreme** cases, and they are extrapolated to real-life situations.

- Utilitarianism appears good till we are not in a decision-making situation.
- We mainly evaluate the decisions taken by the government as per the number of beneficiaries or principles involved.

**Rawls Veil of Ignorance (Explanation):(5:50 PM):**

- John Rawls suggested that we should imagine we sit behind a veil of ignorance that keeps us from knowing who we are and identifying with our personal circumstances.
- By being ignorant of our circumstances, we can more objectively consider how societies should operate. working out what justice requires demands that we think as if we are building society from the ground up, in a way that everyone who is reasonable can accept.
- We, therefore, need to imagine ourselves in a situation _before_ any particular society exists.
- We need to get behind a veil ( get ignorant of the outcome), and then evaluate the step.
- **For example,** we must assume ourselves to be pregnant women, and then evaluate the arguments.
- The concept can also be used to evaluate other situations like affirmative action.

**Immanuel Kant’s deontology:**  
According to Kant, an ethical act is one that satisfies two conditions:

- It can be universalized, or be applicable in all circumstances.
- It should treat humanity as an end in itself, rather than as a means.
- Kant says if a human being agrees to be utilized as a means for achieving someone’s end then such use of humanity will be ethical only if the decision was completely voluntary and made under the exercise of free will.

|   |
|---|
|**Theft v/s poverty:**  <br>If someone has been hungry for days and then steals to feed himself, Kantian ethics would not justify the action because:<br><br>- Hunger/Poverty is only the circumstance, the action is still theft.<br>- If stealing is universalized then the societal trust in itself would erode.|
|**Telling truth v/s Saving life:**<br><br>- If **A** hid in your house and **B**came searching for him to kill and asks about A.<br>- Lying to save someone’s life would still be wrong.<br>- If you lied, it is possible that after A escaped he later encountered B after which B kills A.<br>- Now unknowingly, even you have become a part of the murder.|

**John Rawls (Dictation) (6:13 PM):**

- Rawls is less concerned with ethics but more with policy.
- According to Rawls, the right decision is one that is fair and just.
- To arrive at this right decision, the decision-maker should consider himself as the stakeholder to be affected by the decision, without knowing the outcome.
- For this, Rawls says that the decision-maker should go behind the **veil of ignorance**.
- Which is an idea that reflects that the decision-maker does not know his own position in society beforehand, and should be ready to accept whatever outcome is a result of the decision.

**Case 7: Surrogacy:**

- Commercial surrogacy was justified on the basis of providing financial benefits to the women who rent their wombs.
- Regarding this, the Government reasoned that financial initiatives alone cannot justify any action.
- It is possible that the baby hence born has some deformities and the customer couple refuses to accept it.
- In that case, the one-time payment would certainly be not enough for the upkeep of the child throughout his/her life.
- It is also possible that the surrogate mother might develop feelings for the baby.
- **Kantian perspective** says that the action is unjustified as it uses one human being (baby) as a means to the end for others( parenthood and money).
- **The utilitarian perspective** might support the decision as it causes happiness to many- the childless couple, the surrogate mother, and the persons of the surrogacy clinic.

**Refer to the question projected on the board in the class:** Child marriage case.  
**Possible steps that can be taken(Students' responses:)**

- Making the girl's parents understand the demerits and consequences of early marriage, and initiate legal proceedings if they persist.
- Arranging the employment/skill training of the girl.
- Using the Rawlsian technique to convince the girl’s parents.
- Intimate the local NGO to persuade.
- Give the reference to related government schemes.
- Trying to convince the friend first.
- Taking the help of the police to stop the marriage.
- Informing the girl about the case and consequences.

**Things to be taken care of:**

- Our answers must not reflect compromise and look for an easy way out.
- While writing answers, we must show the conviction of a civil servant, or else our answer would either end up as too idealistic or a compilation of ill effects of early marriage.
- In most cases, the parties concerned are already aware of the legalities and consequences.
- Don’t suggest impractical steps like- promising to bear the expenses of the girl. 
- We must avoid trying to justify wrong actions on the basis of circumstances. The whole purpose of making laws is to criminalize certain actions under all circumstances.
- There will be time paucity in ethics papers and the examiner will most probably judge our character on the final answers that were written under time constraints.

**Answer:**

- This is a case of underage marriage, and as a concerned citizen, I cannot allow this to proceed.
- It will be my moral responsibility to stop this legally and ethically wrong act.
- First I will try to convince the family, and if they sound too unreasonable, I will not devote more time and energy to it.
- I will report the incident to the police and register an FIR against both families.
- I would use social- media to report this incident on a real-time basis so as to create social pressure.
- If the dowry is the issue, I will use social media to crowdfund some funds that could be used for the girl's education.
- I would demonstrate that their problems are not unique and are solvable.
- This will portray me as a concerned citizen who is aware and enthusiastic about his rights as well as the rights of others.
- The **courage of conviction:** Knowing that I could get beaten, taking the stand for what I think is right.

**Case 8: (6:48 PM):**  
**Information on old police records:**  
**X must reveal the information because:**

- To fulfill the professional duty.
- To prevent **cognitive dissonance** for X ( X might keep thinking that he should have told).
- Concealing the fact would signify a lack of integrity.

**X must not reveal the information because:**

- It is not his duty.
- The truth cannot be hidden for long, and the company would eventually know about it.
- It will violate Y's **right to be forgotten.**
- It can be a case of **double jeopardy** as  Y has completed his sentence.
- It might cause economic loss to the company.
- It might have negative impacts on Y’s life.
- It will be against the right to work and decent livelihood.

**Solution:**

- X is in accidental possession of the information.
- The information was not sought by the company.
- Y has done no wrong as the information was not sought during the application process of the company.

**Case 9 (7:16 PM):**  
**Experimental drug against a deadly disease:**  
**Ethical issues involved:**

- Medical ethics- the duty of not causing more harm than good.
- The cost of not doing anything is very high in this case

**The Indian experience with the Covid-19 pandemic could be useful here:**

- During the first wave, there was no enthusiasm or trust in domestically made vaccines -Covaxin and Covidshield.
- After and during the second wave, people were frantic and even paranoid to get whatever vaccine or medical aid was available.
- Overuse of steroids gave rise to **black fungus** cases, that had to be dealt with **Amphotericin.**
- Along with oxygen cylinders, and oxygen concentrators, there were even shortages of **Remdisivir** which was not effective against Covid.
- We see that proper communication and trust-building are most necessary.￼￼**Solution:**
- Completion of all the stages of the trial will be taken up on a priority basis.
- As a health official, it is my duty to start the drug administration, rather than wait for things to get better or worse from there.
- I can go on a case-by-case basis administration under strict supervision, and trials must be done parallelly.
- If not beneficial, it will be stopped.
- In this case, the cost of not making a decision is too high in this case.
- I can also go for alternate ways to control the spread of the disease at the same time.
- Rigorous information and communication campaign that will reach everyone, leaving no scope for anxiety and rumors is a must.
- By doing so, I would have demonstrated that I could take decisions in difficult situations and take people along with me.

**Case 10  (8:00 PM):**  
**Bribe asked for confiscated consignment:**  
**Possible steps:**

- Give the bribe and take evidence and see to it after the event.
- Don’t give bribe as there would not be much less for some delay as the product has already been advertised properly.
- Use of social media/ sting operation.
- Provide the required documents as soon as possible.
- Use the incident as a marketing strategy.
- Consult lawyer.
- Let the consignment pass and later conduct a post facto inquiry.
- Pay the challan.

**Solution:**

- I will send my legal team to release the consignment released and initiate legal actions against the inspector.
- This will demonstrate your awareness of your duties and conviction.

**The topics for the next class:** Students must go through case studies number 11 & 12.

**Case study 3 (06:05 PM)**

- **UPSC 2015 QUESTION: There is a disaster-prone State having frequent landslides, forest fires, cloudbursts, flash floods and earthquakes, etc. Some of these are seasonal and often unpredictable. The magnitude of the disaster is always unanticipated. During one of the seasons, a cloudburst caused devastating floods and landslides leading to high casualties. There was major damage to infrastructure like roads, bridges and power generating units. This led to more than 100000 pilgrims, tourists and other locals being trapped across different routes and locations. The people trapped in your area of responsibility included senior citizens, patients in hospitals, women and children, hikers, tourists, the ruling party’s regional president along with his family, the additional chief secretary of the neighbouring State and prisoners in jail.****￼****As a civil services officer of the State, what would be the order in which you would rescue these people and why? Give justifications.**
- **Approach:** 
- Save Anyone whose distress call is in need 
- Vulnerability and Proximity: Save those people who cannot save themselves
- In this regard, I would firstly evacuate: (Give your reasons for your actions)
- Women and Children
- Senior citizens
- Patients if at a vulnerable place
- Prisoners as they are completely dependent on the state
- Hikers
- Ministers and additional chief secretaries: would be evacuated based on the category they come into. If they belong to vulnerable sections, they will be evacuated early else the same procedure would be followed. 

**Case study 4 (6:47 PM)**

- **You are the leader of a 5 member team that has been assigned to carry out a social impact assessment of a project proposed in a Naxal area.

Hitherto, the economically better-off neighbouring countries have accommodated the streams of migrants with financial support from your organisation. The violence in the region...(Refer to question from the handouts)**
- Regarding the drainage of resources in the face of subdued economic conditions: Yes, the cost of maintaining refugees in camps and shelters may drain resources temporarily, but in the medium term, there are economic benefits to be reaped. 
- Addressing domestic political repercussions: Build Public Opinion
- Rehabilitation will encourage more influx and indirectly fuel the persecutors: This argument mixes the two problems at hand together and confuses the cause-effect relation. 
- Permanency of settlement in face of better prospects than at home: The refugees are mostly fleeing persecution in their home countries but are also attracted by the economic prospects that these countries offer.
- We Appeal to them but won't force them. 

**TOPIC FOR THE NEXT CLASS: WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CASE STUDIES**

- It is the company's prerogative to give importance which deciding its price eg cost of manufacturing, the ability of consumers to pay, goodwill of the company, pricing to retain its market share, generating revenue for investment for future  
- In a market, it is the producer and consumer who decides the price 
- However, in a monopolistic market, the producer's excessive pricing power and if monopoly pertains to a necessary good such as life-saving drugs, the producer can potentially abuse that pricing power 
- In order to prevent the abuse of pricing power, there are regulations in place eg Drug Pricing Control Order (DPCO)
- The company can generate goodwill and return back the society from where it is generating profits 
- A company in this way behaves as a benevolent monopolist - a price differentiating monopolist

# Ethics Case Study Class 07
 
**INTRODUCTION AND BRIEF OVERVIEW OF LAST CLASS (1:09 PM)**  
**ETHICS CASE STUDIES (1:13 PM)**  
**Case study - 01 (1:17 PM)**

- Dr X is a leading medical practitioner in the city. He has set up a charitable trust through which he plans to establish a super-specialty hospital in the city to cater to the medical needs of all sections of society. Incidentally, that part of the State had been neglected over the years. The proposed hospital would be a boon for the region. You are heading the tax investigation agency of that region. During an inspection of the doctor’s clinic, your officers found some major irregularities. A few of them are substantial which had resulted in considerable withholding of tax that should be paid by him now. The doctor is cooperative. He undertakes to pay the tax immediately. However, there are certain other deficiencies in his tax compliance which are purely technical. If these technical defaults are pursued by the agency, considerable time and energy of the doctor will be diverted to issues that are not so serious, urgent or even helpful to the tax collection process. Further, in all probability, it will hamper the prospects of the hospital coming up.
- **There are two options before you -**
- (1) Taking a broader view, ensure substantial tax compliance and ignore defaults that are merely technical.
- (2) Pursue the matter strictly and proceed on all fronts, whether substantial or merely technical.
- **As the head of the tax agency, which course of action will you opt for and why? (2018)** 
- **Approach -** 
- Both options can be pursued-but these need to be substantiated with valid reasons. For example, Option(2)-addressing the technical compliance as this gives the completion of the tax process-it ensures tax compliance and helps in correct assessment of the taxes, etc.
- **Measures -**
- The public good should not suffer.
- Helpful for the future.
- It could bring more issues from the past.

**Case study - 02 (1:43 PM)**

- Honesty and uprightness are the hallmarks of a civil servant. Civil servants possessing these qualities are considered the backbone of any strong organization. In the line of duty, they take various decisions, and at times some become bonafide mistakes. As long as such decisions are not taken intentionally and do not benefit personally, the officer cannot be said to be guilty. Though such decisions may, at times, lead to unforeseen adverse consequences in the long term. In the recent past, a few instances have surfaced wherein civil servants have been implicated for bonafide mistakes. They have often been prosecuted and even imprisoned. The instances have greatly rattled the moral fibre of the civil servants.
- **How does this trend affect the functioning of civil services? What measures can be taken to ensure that honest civil servants are not implicated for the bonafide mistakes on their part? Justify your answer. (2019)**
- **Approach-**
- Civil services are expected to be leaders-the decisions are expected to be objective and non-partisan. They cannot be asked to take the blame for the wrong consequences of the decisions taken-they should take responsibility but not the blame. if they are blamed, it causes indecisiveness and this affects the governance.
- **Measures** - Transparency in communication - legitimacy and greater acceptability.
- Take better decisions - training, data and feedback.

**Case study - 03 (02:10 PM)**

- You are posted in a district as a public servant responsible for looking into the matters of violation of the Right to Education Act. You came across a case in which a poor farmer had beaten his daughter for not going to take her fifth-class annual exams. Eventually, he tied her up with his motorbike and took her to the examination hall. Corporal punishment to children by parents or teachers is a punishable offence with a three-month jail term. When you enquired about it the poor farmer explained that he had done so for ensuring a better future for her daughter as he does not want his children to live in poverty in which he is living. He also says that his economic condition is poor and if he is taken to jail his children will face severe hardships.
