**Break 11:12 AM to 11:25 AM**
 
**Problems on Calenders:**

- Fundamental concept is that a week will repeat after 7 days
- We are given the reference date or day and from there we have to move towards finding the targetted date
- **Steps to be followed:**
- Step#1: Find total number of days
- Step#2: Find the number of weeks
- Step#3: Find the number of odd days
- **Odd days** are defined as such days that cannot be included in a week (set of 7 days), eg.
- **January:** Number of days = 31, number of odd days = 31/7 = 3 odd days
- **April:** Number of days =30, odd days = 30/7 = 2 odd days - **Q. If the 1st of Arpil 2003 was Monday, then which day of the week will 25th Dec 2003?**
- **1st Method:**
- Step#1 = find total number of day between 1st April and 25th Dec 2003 = 268 (reference date is not included and the targetted date is including)
- Step#2 = Find the odd days = 268/7 = 2 odd days
- Step#3 = Mark the day, Wednesday will be the day
-   
    
- **2nd Method:**
- Step#1 = find number of odd days in every month and add them
- Step#2 divide the summation of odd days by 7 and find the remainder - **Q.2. If the 1st of Jan 1992 is a Tuesday then which day of the week will be 1st of Jan 1993?**
- Find whether the year is a leap year or not (if the year is divisible by 4 it will be a leap year)
- Number of days in a leap year = 366 #remember-for-later
- Number of days in ordinary year = 365
- 1992 is a leap year as it is divisible by 4
- Number of odd days in a leap year =  366/7 = 2 odd days
- Number of odd days in an ordinary day = 365/7 = 1 odd day - **A century year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400 and if it is not then it is not a leap year**
- For 100 years there are 24 leap years and 76 ordinary years and thus the total number of odd days  = 5 odd days
- For 200 years there are 3 odd days and for 300 years it is 1 odd day and 400 years there are zero odd days.
- Thus the calendar repeats itself after 400 years.

**Next Class Topics - Clocks and Cubes**
   

**Reasoning Class 02**  
**(9:08 AM) Clocks and Cubes:**

- **Clocks:**
- **Characteristics =** Hour hand, Minute hand, and Second hand
- Each hand moves total angle of 360 degrees
- A typical clock is divided into 12 sections or sectors considering it to be a circle
- The angle at the center for each part /sector/section = 360 / 12 = 30 degrees
- In 1 hour (60 minutes) Minute hand covers 360 degrees
- **In 1 one minute the Minute hand will cover 360 / 60 = 6 degrees**
- In 5 minutes total angle Minute hands move = 30 degrees
- In 60 minutes the Hour hand will cover 30 degrees
- **In one minute the Hour hand will cover 30/60 = 1/2 degrees** - **Types of questions may be asked:**
- 1. Angles between the two hands
- 2. You are given an angle and you have to find an exact time
- 3. Gaps of time
- 4. Gain or loss in time - **(9:28 AM) Q.1. An accurate clock shows 8'o clock in the morning. Through how many degrees the hour hand will rotate when the clock shows 2'o clock in the afternoon?**
- Number of hours between 8 AM and 2 PM = 6hours
- The hour hand moves 30 degrees in one hour and hence it will move 6x30 = **180 degrees** - **Q.2. Through how many degrees does the minute hand rotate between 3:00 AM to 3:15 AM?**
- Total time = 15 minutes
- One minute the Minute hand moves = 6 degrees and thus in 15 minutes it will rotate 15x6 = **90 degrees** - **Q.3. At 3:40 the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock form an angle of?**
- In each minute the hour hand moves by 1/2 degrees and hence in 40 minutes it moves by 20 degrees
- Therefore the angle between the hour hand and minute hand = 150 - 20 = **130 degrees**
-   
    
- **Formula = (5h-m)6 +m/2**
-   
    
- **(9:59 AM) Q.4. The angle between the minute hand and the hour hand of a clock when the time is 8:30?**
- Use the formula = (5x8-30)6 +30/2 = 60+15 = **75 degrees** - **Q.5. The angle between the minute hand and the hour hand of a clock when the time is 4:20?**
- Use the formula = (5x5-20)6 +20/2 = **10 degrees** - **Q.6. Which of the following times do the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock make an angle of 180 degrees with each other?** - The answer is 8 to 8:15 the hands make 180 degree
-   
    

**Break 10:53 AM to 11:07 AM**
