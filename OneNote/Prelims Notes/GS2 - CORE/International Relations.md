**Basic terms and concepts:**  
**Schools of thought on international Politics**: (5:46 PM)

- **1. Idealism**: In opposition to realism is the school of idealism; which presents a utopian worldview; area of cooperation (not competition) based on rule of law, values and norms/customs and conventions

- Countries and Nation-States - have their territory; population; government and are sovereign    
- **3. Liberalism**: It was born in reaction to realism and its description and power struggle which resulted in World Wars
- It believes in the idea that man is a rational being and has several schools of thought within it. 
- It believes in the establishment of international organisations - League of Nations (LON), UN
- Also, believes in the promotion of free trade to developing economic interdependence which would make the war costlier - WTO

**Suggestions for World Peace**: (6:08 PM)

- Realist - **Balance of power:**
- It requires 4 or 5 nation-states practising power parity.
- If any country seeks to gain pre-ponderance of power rest of the countries will come together to stop such an attempt 
- For example - Concert in Europe 
- Liberalism - Establishment of International organisations, promotion of free trade; people-to-people ties
- **Diplomacy** - 3 tracks of diplomacy 
- Track 1 Diplomacy - Governmnet to Governmnet relations; bilateral summit; 2+2 Dialogue; QUAD at Ministerial level; etc 
- Track 2 Diplomacy - it involves retired bureaucrats; academicians; NGOs; think tanks of one country interacting with others; eg Neemrana Dialogue with India-Pakistan; Advantage - It takes away from the media gaze; 
- Track 3 - It is people-to-people; eg business-to-business  
- Track 1.5 Diplomacy - Presence of government officials and retired bureaucrats/religious leaders/NGOs; the combination of both 1 and 2 diplomacies; example - Raisina Dialogue in India which is conducted by MEA and ORF which is an Indian Think Tank 
- Raisina Dialogue (Track 1.5) is based on the Shangrila Dialogue (Track 1) which is organised by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), Singapore and is attended only by defence ministers and military chiefs of Asia-Pacific Countries 
- Multi-Track Diplomacy: Multiple tracks of diplomacy operated simultaneously 
- Public Diplomacy: Governmnet of one country communicates with the public/people of another country 
- It is a government-sponsored effort aimed at communicating directly with foreign publics to establish a dialogue to inform and favourably influence the public opinion in that country vis-a-vis the former 
- In 2006 - The division of Public Diplomacy was established under the  Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)

**Types of Power**: (6:47 PM)

- **Hard Power:** Military and Economic Power; the power of coercion; is tangible  
- **Soft Power**: Power of attraction; eg Yoga, philosophies, cuisines, dance forms; sports - Cricket Diplomacy; culture; it is intangible; the concept was given by Joesph Nye; it has been important due to the ICT revolution 
- Shashi Tharoor - If world power was calculated in terms of soft power, India would have been a thumping superpower 
- **Smart Power**: It is the optimal mix of both hard and soft power 

**World Order**: (7:04 PM)

- It is an overview of the distribution of power in the world 
- **Unipolar** - When there is a single superpower; eg for a brief window (1991-2001; due to 9/11 attacks) following the disintegration of the USSR
- Superpower - It is more powerful than the combined power of other nations; the only solution is a bandwagon  
- **Bipolar** - When there are two superpowers; eg during the Cold war ie USA and USSR; a superpower is balanced by another superpower
- **Multi-polar** - Currently we are witnessing an emergence of multipolarity; where 4 or 5 countries become powerful; 
- Billiard Ball Model (previously) to Complex-Interdependence/Cob Web Model (now): 
- Billiard Ball Model: The only mode of interaction between nation-states was government to government 
- Cob Web Model: There are multiple pathways and gateways of interaction which has emerged 

**The Nationa States versus State nations Versis Civilizational States**: (7:15 PM)

- Nation-States - Country; eg India 
- State Nation - different states comprising a country 
- The Civilizational States - A country merely does not reflect a territory or an ethnolinguistic group but rather a unique civilization; eg India, Iran, China

**Foreign Policy and determinants of Foreign Policy**: (7:33 PM)

- It is a strategy of a state vis-a-vis other countries or other international agencies/entities to secure its national interest 
- The foreign policy of a country is not shaped by one or one set of factors 
- It is shaped by multiple factors which are referred to as determinants of the foreign policy 
- **Determinants**:
- Economic 
- History 
- Geography
- Domestic Milieu 
- Military Power
- Culture
- World Order 
- Political leadership 

**Geographical factors as a determinant of Foreign Policy**: (7:41 PM)

- 1. India's strategic location at the centre of the Asain Arc extending from Aden to Tokyo makes it a gateway to South East Asia, Central and West Asia  
- It was because of this that both USA and USSR initially competed to bring India within their sphere of influence during the cold war 
- Also, it was India's geographical proximity to the communist world (USSR and China) while being ideologically more inclined to the liberal world that India chose the path of non-alignment 
- 2. India's location at the head of the Indian Ocean along with other determinants makes India a net security provider in the region 
- 3. India is a country with a long coastline along with a long-running continental man-made frontier/borders  
- Thus, unlike USA and UK has to develop strong naval power along with a land-based military apart from strong diplomatic relations with both RIM and the land frontier countries 
- 4. India's Look East and Look West policies are determined by Geography and expressed in Geographical terms 
- 5. Distance has been identified as the prime inhibiting factor in the development of India- Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries
- 6. India's geographical size and large population, apart from other factors make it a strong contender for UNSC permanent membership 

**Cultural factors as determinants of Foreign Policy**: (7:58 PM)

- There are very few civilization states in the world and India is one of them therefore India World view cannot be separated from its culture and traditions 
- In fact, India's first PM, the key architect of India's foreign policy had commented that he is not developing any new foreign policy for the country rather he is merely "re-discovering it from the past"
- India's commitment to international peace as evident under Article 51 of the Indian Constitution is indicative of Indian Civilizational Values of non-violence, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam; Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah, etc 
- While other countries use military or economic power to gain influence in the international sphere, Indian culture has been the source of its immense soft power 
- Indian schools of Yoga, Ayurveda, Indian philosophy and mythologies, cuisines, etc are sources of this soft power   
- Through building Ramayan circuits and Buddhist Circuit, GOI has sought to pursue close relations with Nepal, Sri Lanka, etc 
- Apart from the rich passive tradition, Kautilya's Arthashastra represents the realist school of thought 
- His Mandal theory is one of the earliest examples of Geopolitical theories  
- In fact, while BJP is greatly influenced by the realist tradition of Kautilya, the passive Buddhist tradition finds greater reflection in Congress's political philosophy 
- Civilizational states like India are not satisfied with the mere pursuit of foreign policy to secure their national interest 
- They seek to shape the world order according to their value system  
- As India could successfully achieve by carving out the 3rd Pole reflected in NAM in the bipolar world 

**Topics for the next class**: Continuation of determinants of India's foreign policy and Evolution of India's foreign policy, etc 
 
# International Relations Class 02
 
**A brief review of the previous class**. (5:30 PM)  
**History as a determinant of Foreign Policy**: (5:33 PM)

- India's support of freedom struggle movements in Africa and Latin America is a consequence of India's own experience of colonial subservience 
- The racial discrimination which Indians faced in India and elsewhere during the colonial rule made them ardent supporters of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in South Africa 
- The partition of India and the creation of Pakistan on religious grounds made it difficult for India to accept the creation of a new state, Israel on similar grounds 
- The distrust, shown during the Partition of the country continues to adversely affect India-Pakistan relations 

**Military Power as a determinant of Foreign Policy:** (5:42 PM)

- India could secure its national interest, develop good relations with the USA and in fact emerge as a major power in the world only after successfully conducting the Nuclear weapon test in 1998 (Operation Shakti)

**Economic Power as a determinant of Foreign Policy:** (5:50 PM)

- It was after the adoption of the new economic policy and consequent LPG reforms that the then GOI launched the Look East Policy to develop good relations with the vibrant economies of South East Asia, the Asian Tigers 
- In fact, foreign policies are intrinsically linked to the economic goals of a country, since they aim to secure the national interest of the country 
- India's pursuit of close relations with Saudi Arabia and UAE apart from energy security is dedicated to India seeking investments in infrastructure 
- Similarly, these two countries, are presently seen prioritising their relations with India over Pakistan (a traditional ally) as they seek the large market that India has to offer 

**World Order** **as a determinant of Foreign Policy**: (6:06 PM)

- During the Cold war, when the world order was bipolar, India created a 3rd Pole ie NAM
- Since, as a newly independent country, India did not want to be part of either military pact 
- With the disintegration of the USSR and the emergence of the unipolar World Order, India took steps to befriend the USA
- In the present era of multipolarity, India seeks to pursue strategic autonomy through multiple alignments 
- India has entered into strategic partnerships with more than 30 countries and is part of QUAD, JAI Trilateral and at the same time is also part of the RIC Trilateral, an active member of BRICS and SCO

**Evolution of India's Foreign Policy**: (6:14 PM)

- 1947-62 - Phase of high Idealism/Phase of Optimistic Non-Alignment 
- 1962-71 - Decade of realism and recovery 
- 1971-91 - Period of Great regional Assertion 
- 1991-2001 - US superpower and unipolar world 
- 2001 - 2014 - International Environment becomes very competitive 
- 2014 Onwards - China is becoming more assertive 

**Phase 1: 1947-62 - Phase of high Idealism**: (6:22 PM)

- Characteristic feature: India's adoption of the Policy of Non-Alignment 
- Purpose:
- 1. To be able to judge international issues based on their merit and not be forced to take a particular stand based on membership of either of the poles 
- In fact, Indian policymakers made strong efforts to distinguish India's Non-Alignment from the policy of neutrality 
- 2. To escape the entrapment of cold war rivalry between US-led NATO Countries and USSR led Warsaw Countries 
- Other reasons:
- Apart from its resonance, with Indian civilizational values and the value of non-violence that motivated the Indian freedom struggle, practical consideration of utilising limited economic resources  of the country for development rather than the military pursuit
- Other features: 
- 1. India played a key role in the multi-lateral institute of eg UN - a primary true contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, part of commissions on Vietnam and the Korean conflict 
- 2. India was the champion of disarmament and it pioneered the partial test ban treaty 
- 3. India was a critical proponent of NAM

**1962-71 - Decade of realism and recovery**: (6:44 PM)

- The following years are referred to as the fractured years 
- India faced several acute domestic challenges ranging from political instability, agricultural distress, to economic uncertainty  
- Also, India witnessed 3 wars during this phase  
- However, India made pragmatic foreign policy choices on security and political challenges 
- Consequently, despite India's vulnerability, India came out of an anxious phase without losses 
- In fact, it created the ground for India to emerge as the unquestionable leader of South Asia 

**1971-91 - Period of Great regional Assertion**: (7:01 PM)

- It started with the decisive dismemberment of Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh and ended with Indian Peacekeeping forces, misadventure in Sri Lanka 
- During this phase, the external strategic environment was marked by the Sino-US Reproachment of 1971 leading to the beginning of the development of the US-Pakistan-China Axis, consequently, India concluded a Peace and Friendship Treaty with USSR reading to a USSR tilt in India's stand on international issues 
- Important developments during this phase:
- India-Pakistan war - Dismemberment of Pakistan to create Bangladesh 
- With this India merged as the undisputed leader of the sub-continent 
- However, India's regional ascendance did not lead to it becoming an important global player throughout these decades 
- The reason was sub-optimal economic performance - The Indian economy was trapped in the so-called "Hindu Rate of Growth" (3 to 5% GDP growth rate per annum)
- Following, China's development of Nuclear Weapons, India conducted its first nuclear test - It was code-named "Smiling Buddha" also it was referred to as SNEP (Sub Terranean Nuclear Explosion Project) or PNE (Peaceful Nuclear Explosion) in 1974
- India faced global diplomatic disapprobation and significant technological and economic sanctions 
- NSG was established to consolidate Nuclear apartheid or check India's participation in global nuclear trade 

**1991-2001 - US superpower and the unipolar world:**  (7:22 PM)

- The global strategic environment was characterised by unipolarity; following the disintegration of the USSR and the establishment of the US as the single superpower
- It is the brief moment of the USA's unipolarity that the world has witnessed

- India sought to develop good relations with the USA. Questions were raised on the relevance of NAM
- Adoption of new economic policy and undertaking LPG Reforms 
- India shed export pessimism for the promotion of export and trade being the primary contributor to GDP 
- Following the launch of the New Economic Policy at the political level. India decided to chart, a new course in its foreign policy 
- Launch of Its Look East Policy and Normalisation of India's relation with Israel 
- India crossed the nuclear Rubicon - given the security threats from China  as well as growing international efforts to check Nuclear proliferation, India decided to undertake Nuclear weapon tests and became a de-facto Nuclear Power

**2001-14 - International Environment becomes very competitive:** (7;37 PM)

- The external environment became more competitive with the USA finding it difficult to maintain the same degree of unipolarity 
- India gradually acquired the attributes of a balancing power 
- India discovered the benefits of working with different powers on different issues 
- It is reflected in India-US Civil Nuclear Deal and India growing closer to the west in general 
- At the same time, India found a common cause with China vis-a-vis global negotiations on Climate Change and Trade; BRICS emerged as a major forum 

**2014 Onwards - China is becoming more assertive:** (7:45 PM)

- China become assertive and the terms of engagement that it has offered to the world have progressively hardened 
- Also, the full impact of the 2008 Financial Crisis is now evident - Rise of the East and the decline of the West 
- The USA's resource limitation has been further aggravated by its risk aversion; Europe also turned increasing inwards; Multi-polarity is now seriously upon us 
- Faced with these developments, India chose energetic diplomacy/fast diplomacy/agile diplomacy 
- India recognised its own capabilities; our ability to shoulder greater responsibilities such as with respect to Climate Change negotiations in Paris and India's commitment to it; pursuit of South-South partnership; etc 

**Topics for the next class**: Relevance of NAM, India and Its Neighbourhood, etc 
 
# International Relations Class 03
 
**REVIEW OF THE PREVIOUS CLASS (5:11 PM)**  
**RELEVANCE OF NAM (5:21 PM)**

- **Block Politics**
- During the cold war, the world was divided into 2 blocks- One led by the USA (Military alliance- NATO) and USSR (Warsaw Pct)
- The urge for freedom from colonial rule led to the development of the distinct idea of active involvement in world affairs guided by one own national interest.
- **Did it Represent India's Idealism**-
- It is said to represent India's idealism since it traces its routes in India's civilizational values as well as values of India's freedom struggle.
- It emphasised peace and international cooperation rather than building military alliances.
- However, most foreign policies choices were based on pragmatic reasoning-
- A newly independent India prioritised economic development.
- India needed resources in the form of trade and as well as economic assistance. These policies enabled them to have economic relations with all countries. 
- Need for peace without which there could not be any real development.
- Need to secure itself from global threat perceptions imitating cold war politics
- India while ideologically closer to the liberal world was located in geographical proximity to the communist world.
- India's internal political plurality 
- **What is the Policy of NAM was not**
- **It was not a policy of neutrality.** Non-alignment was a political concept whereas neutrality is a legal concept.
- Unlike neutrality, Non-Alignment is not a law written into the constitution. Unlike neutrality, which stands for war aversion and not taking a stand on the various global development, non-alignment stands for an active role in world affairs; taking decisions/positions based on the merit of each issue
- **It did not represent India's opportunism** nor was it a policy of India's isolation from world affairs.
- **The policy of Non-Alignment is not directed against any ideology** but seeks to promote peace and cooperation irrespective of the ideological differences.

**PHASES OF POLICY OF NON-ALIGNMENT (5:55 PM)** 

- 1947-62
- The policy of Non-alignment was followed in its ideal sense. 
- 1962-90
- During the first phase, India fought two wars. In both these wars, India had to compromise with respect to India's territorial integrity which in fact constitutes the core National interest of all countries.
- The US-Pakistan-China axis was in the making following the US-China rapprochement.
- Consequently, India concluded the India-Soviet treaty of peace, friendship and cooperation in 1971. Thus during this phase, India's policy of Non-alignment developed a pro-soviet tilt and came to imply reflexive Americanism.
- 1990 Onwards-
- The policy of Non-alignment following the end of the cold war did not have many takers in India
- Both the centrist congress as well as the rightist BJP were no longer interested in the pursuit of the Policy of Non-alignment
- Apart from structural changes in international politics, domestic factors like the adoption of new economic policy denuded the support for non-alignment.
- It was only the leftist parties in India who emphasised India following a policy of Non-alignment
- India's present external affairs minister has commented that the policy of Non-alignment was relevant in a specific era and in a particular context. However, it is the Independence of action which continues to be a factor of continuity.
- Thus,  today the policy of non-alignment is not the prime construct of India's foreign policy. 
- However, it continues to be cited often as a description of India's policy more because of the failure of India's elite to come out with as grand a vision as the concept of Non-alignment.
- Successive formulations to replace the video of Non-alignment have been coined and rejected.
- Strategic autonomy soon acquired the tint of anti-Americanism
- Multiple alignments- In recent times, when multipolarity is upon us India can pursue the policy of Non-alignment through multiple alignments. Indian civil society presented a document called NAM 2.O.
- However, since multiple alignments may convey an impression of opportunism, it was eventually rejected.
- Seeking issue-based partnerships- Could not acquire necessary attraction
- Advancing prosperity and influence is how the present External Minister chose to describe India's internal partnerships.

**RELEVANCE OF NAM IN POST-COLD WAR WORLD ORDER OR MULTI-POLAR WORLD ORDER (6:42 PM)**

- NAM evolved out of the concerted efforts of individual non-aligned states to build a common front against superpower dominance and neo-imperialist domination.
- Leaders-Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah and Sukarno of Indonesia 
- **Evolution-**
- 1947: Asian Relations conference
- April 1955- Bandung conference - Indonesia
- Afro-Asian Relations Conference
- Bandung conference was called by India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Burma and Srilanka (Pakistan was not a part of NAM at that time. Pakistan became a member in the 6th NAM summit)
- The **first NAM Summit Conference** took place in Belgrade, **Yugoslavia, in September 1961**.
- Pakistan previously was a member of SEATO AND CENTO. **Pakistan formally left SEATO in 1973**
- NAM has **120 members** as of April 2018 comprising 53 countries from Africa, 39 from Asia, 26 from Latin America and the Caribbean and 2 from Europe (Belarus, Azerbaijan). There are **17 countries and 10 international organizations** that are **Observers** at NAM.
- **It does not have a formal constitution on a permanent secretariat**
- Its administration is non-hierarchical and rotational. The presidency is rotated between the members and it stays until the next summit
- Decisions are based on consensus which requires substantial agreement but non-unanimity.
- **CONDITIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP OF NAM**
- A country should not be a member of the multilateral military alliance, should not be part of a bilateral military agreement with great power or a member of a region defence pact. 
- A country should not concede military bases to a foreign power specifically in the context of great power politics.
- Should follow an independent non-alignment foreign policy
- Should support movements of national independence
- **Achievements of NAM**-
- 1960-70: The agenda of NAM was decolonisation in Asia and Africa. This was the golden phase of NAM. Successful in achieving its agenda. 
- 1970-80: The agenda was the establishment of a New International economic order (NIEO). The agenda was a non-starter. 
- 1980-90: The agenda was Global nuclear disarmament. Failed to achieve any success. 
- 1990 onwards- Disintegration of USSR. End of the cold war and thus questions were raised vis-a-vis raison d'être. 
- Following the end of the cold war, some member countries including founding member countries like Egypt were of the view that NAM should be dissolved as an organisation.
- However, the majority of NAM countries decided to reorient and continue with it. Even India's then PM PV Narsimha Rao was of the opinion that the purpose of NAM Was not mere opposition of the block politics.
- Its other purposes were to Build a new world order based on sovereignty, equality and the democratisation of the world order
- Strengthening International law and world peace
- South-South cooperation
- Equitable and sustainable development
- Since these issues continued to be relevant so did NAM after the end of the cold war
- However, it was realised that the business as the usual approach was sub-optimal and NAM needs to be revitalised. So in the Havana summit in 2006 new agenda was adopted.
- To promote multilateralism
- Sovereign equality
- Promote South-South and North-South cooperation
- To oppose excessive hegemonic domination

**PRESENT STATUS OF NAM (7:40 PM)**

- It is facing a crisis of relevance.
- End of Block politics
- The inability of NAM to achieve its agendas except for anti-colonialism and anti-rationalism
- NAM countries remain divided between pro-west and pro-east countries
- Among the founding members- Yugoslavia does not exist, and Egypt is no longer interested India also seeks closer relations with the USA
- India's Pm for the first time has missed 2 consecutive summits of NAM. in Absence of India's leadership, NAM has got radicalised under Cuba and Venezuela. Thus NAM has acquired a very strong anti-west attitude.
- NAM's voice is absent vis-vis major geopolitical developments of the time. EX- Syrian or Yemen Crisis. This is despite the fact that countries like Yemen and Syria are members of NAM
- In the present era of neo-liberal policy-driven globalisation, most of the member countries have been co-opted in the west led global economic order.
- NAM today does not have a concrete agenda, resources, leadership or clear direction for the organisation.
- In fact, **According to C RAJA MOHAN,** it would have been better if NAM countries has decided to dismantle the organisation at the end of the cold war while taking the credit for its end. It would have been a graceful exit for NAM

**IS NAM RELEVANT FOR INDIA (7:54 PM)**

- The present NDA government led by PM Modi makes no illusion with respect to its stance on NAM
- It seeks to pursue a closer relationship with the west, especially in the context of rising of revisionist China
- The USA has traditionally been quite critical of NAM and referred to it as the Team B of the erstwhile USSR and a club of dictators demanding democracy in international politics.
- Even the UPA government wanted to pursue close relations with the USA and consequently ignored NAM
- **However, NAM is relevant for India-**
- NAM is the biggest platform for developing countries outside of the UN general assembly
- Though India is in the club of Neo elites (G20) India has several characteristics of a developing country.
- India is home to the largest number of poor and malnourished children. The acuteness of poverty in certain parts of India is comparable to or at times worse than those of Sub-Saharan Africa
- India to regain the leadership of south
- To achieve its geopolitical aim of permanent membership in the UNSC.
- NAM's leadership will augment India's soft power.
- Thus India has more to gain by actively participating in NAM rather than ignoring it for the sake of a closer relationship with the west
- Also, India has certain fundamental contradictions vis-a-vis the agenda of trade and climate change with the west.

**HOW IS INDIA RELEVANT FOR NAM (8:06 PM)**

- Just as India needs NAM, NAM needs India
- India is the only country that can provide much-needed leadership and resources to NAM
- It can act as a moderator between pro-west and anti-west countries.
- India can help foster not just south-south cooperation but north-south cooperation as well

- 122 member countries.
- It involves state entities; international organisations and private parties.
- Nature of Jurisdiction- It provides for dispute resolution through ADRs(mediation, arbitration, conciliation). All the decisions delivered by PCA are called awards and they are binding on all the parties in the dispute.

- Established in 1945. HQ- Hague, Netherlands.
- All members of the UN are members of ICJ.
- ICJ covered disputes between member countries.

- ICC is intended to complement the existing national judicial system.
- **Reasons why India didn't Join ICC:**
- Indias judicial system is competent one 
- India wanted the use of Nuclear weapons and terrorism to be designated as crimes within the purview of the ICC
- India suffers from insurgency and militancy and consequently has given extraordinary powers to its security personnel to ensure security, law and order in these regions of the country.
- By acceding to ICC It did not want to make its civil and military personnel vulnerable to international jurisdiction.
- As a matter of principle as well India chose not to join ICC or not to sign the Rome statute
- Rome statute provides extraordinary powers to the P5 countries to bind non-member states to ICC.
- It is the process that violates the Vienna Convention on the laws of the treaties which states that no country can be forced to accede to a treaty or be abound by a treaty it has not accepted.

**PERFORMANCE OF UN (7:25 PM)**

- **Collective Security** is based on the theme of one for all and all for one. It is based on the idea that if there is an act of aggression committed by one member country against another, all member countries will come together to punish the aggressor. UNSC has been given the power to operationalise collective security. The consensus of P5 is required.
- **Acheson plan:** It is a mechanism in which in case of a deadlock in UNSC, UNGA can sanction the operationalization of general security when such a  resolution is passed by the 2/3rd majority of the member countries.
- UN Peacekeeping Operations: It is the brainchild of the second secretary generate Dag Hammarskjold. under it Peacekeeping forces (blue helmets) are sent to ensure a ceasefire during the conflict. Bringing an immediate end to hostilities.
- **PKO vs Collective security:**
- **Collective security:** 
- The aim was to punish the aggressor.
- No consent is required 
- Nature: Military action 
- **PKO:** 
- Aim: To ensure a ceasefire.
- Nature: Police action.
- Consent of the parties in conflict
- **Challenges-PKO**
- The nature of the international conflict has changed. With the end of the Cold War, interstate war has declined whereas intra-state wars are the primary conflicts facing the world. Peacekeeping missions which required the content of parties in conflict are more effective in the case of interstate conflicts since the blue helmets become vulnerable to attack by non-state actors in intrastate wars. States In case of violation of the ceasefire agreements is easy to pin responsibility on vis-a-vis non-state actors.
- While the developed countries are primarily involved in financing peacekeeping operations. Developing countries like India and Bangladesh are primarily troop-contributing countries. Decisions vis-a-vis PKO including their deployment is undertaken by the P5 and the developed world to the exclusion of the troop-contributing countries. The latter has demanded their adequate involvement in decision making vis-a-vis PKO
- The developed countries have suggested transforming the nature of PKO into "**robust peacekeeping**" whereby the peacekeeping troops or blue helmets will be involved in the offensive if need be. However such suggestions have been rejected by the troop-contributing countries.

**TOPIC FOR THE NEXT CLASS: WILL COMPLETE THE UN** 
 
# International Relations Class 05
 
**The class Started:      (at 01:15 PM)**

- The previous topic was briefly mentioned.
- 4th challenge: Broad-ranging and complex setup of function/task that UN Blue helmets are expected to perform.
- R2P is an international norm that seeks to ensure that the international community never again fails to prevent human rights violations and halt mass atrocity crimes of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.
- This global political commitment was endorsed by all member states of the UN at the 2005  world summit.
- The three pillars of R2P are:
- 1) Responsibility of each state to protect its population.
- 2) Responsibility of the international community to assist states in protecting their population.
- 3) Responsibility of the international community to protect when a state is manifestly failing to protect its population.
- The three pillars are of equal standing.
- Operational during the Libyan crisis but given its grave misuse by the great powers to forward their interest, it could never be used hence.

**REFORM OF UN         (01:39 PM )**

- Reforms: Charter, Institutional and Financial reform.
- **CHARTER REFORM:** 
- _UN_ charter needs to be amended, article 2,clause7 of the UN charter prohibits UN involvement in the intra-state dispute.
- Since the nature of conflicts has changed in the post-cold war era, from inter-state wars, the world today faces intrastate conflict.
- Un charter makes reference to enemy states, with respect to the Axis powers of world war  2. Such language of the charters needs to be corrected.
- **FINANCIAL REFORM** :
- Problems-
- 1)Given the enormous task that the UN is expected to perform, the funds are insufficient. It is solely dependent upon the membership fee of the UN member countries. Also, countries often delay and at times default on their membership fee payment, the USA is a common delinquent.
- 2) Inefficient utilization of the fund and corruption.
- Suggestions: Provide the UN with some independent source of financing to augment its financing example - the Tobin tax may be imposed on international financial transactions.
- **INSTITUTIONAL REFORM:**   (02:01 PM )
- United General Assembly (UNGA)- better coordination with UNSC.
- Trusteeship Council- it is an organ without any mandate. So either abolish it or give it some new mandate i.e governance of global common (ex the Antarctica, space, climate).
- ECOSOC-given the wide scope of its function and multiple funds and programs with overlapping mandates under it has become unwieldy as a body. suggestion -to streamline ECOSOC. 
- UN Secretariate (2:07 PM )- suffers from bureaucratic red-tapism, corruption, and bureaucratic inertia. Overrepresentation of the west in UN staff.
- Suggestions-check this red-tapism, and corruption and ensure adequate representation of the developing countries in Un Secretariate.
- **UNSC-membership reform is long due:**
- 1) Anachronistic in nature - P5 countries represent the power structure of the immediate post-world war 2 eras. It is not representative of the current power distribution among countries of the world.
- 2) In 1945 when the UN was constituted, it comprise 51 member countries, and then UNSC comprised 5 permanent members and 6 non-permanent.In 1965, when UNSC's non-permanent membership was an increased from 6 to 10 countries, the total membership of 117 countries (02:18 PM).
- In 2022, the total membership of the UN has increased nearly four times its founding membership was 193 countries but the UNSC composition is the same as that in 1965, while the permanent membership is at a standstill since 1945.
- Thus UNSC is unrepresentative of the current membership of the UN.
- 3) Inadequate geographical representation:
- Presently, Asia, the largest and most populated continent is underrepresented by a single country CHINA.
- Europe the second smallest continent is overrepresented by three: Russia, the UK, and France.
- Africa and Latin America, where most of the UN missions are based are not represented at all.
- UNSC is the nucleus of the UN, to ensure the legitimacy of the UN, membership reform of UNSC is critical.

**Aspiring Countries and Region  (2:25 pm)** 

- **G4 countries**- India, Japan, Germany, and Brazil.
- Their candidature is opposed by the coffee club.
- **The coffee club** comprises 40 odd countries of which Italy, Pakistan, Argentina, Spain, Australia, and Canada are the leading countries.
- The coffee club claim that G4 countries are not even regional leaders, so recognizing them as global powers will only create problems for the region.
- To assuage the concerns of the coffee club, the G4 countries have proposed that would accept permanent membership of the UN, without VETO for the first 15 years of membership. 
- However, this has failed to assuage the coffee club which in fact passed a resolution called Uniting for consensus, for such a uniform UN charter garnering consensus should be the guiding criteria as against the special majority requirement for any UN charter reform.
- Canada and South Korea are opposed to developing countries, often dependent on their aid, wielding more power than them at the UN. 
- **Africa Union (AU)** -   demands two permanent seats with a veto.
- The countries to occupy these two seats are still not clear and therefore it is suggested that the two seats will be held by AU on a rotational basis.
- The demand of the AU for UNSC reform is led by the C10 ( Committee of 10 countries ), which intern is led by Siera Leon.
- 3) L 69 is a group of developing countries from Africa, Latin America, and carnelian and Asia pacific islands. the group comprises 42 members as its members. It seeks comprehensive and lasting reforms in the UNSC.
- 4) Organization of Islamic Cooperation(OIC) -they demand permanent membership for Islamic countries in UNSC. However, there demand that is unlikely to be realized since there is no provision for representation on religious grounds.
- **VETO POWER REFORMS**   (02:51 PM)
- P-5 countries have one veto each.
- Since individual veto of p5 countries has been the reason for deadlock in UNSC, which has resulted in its paralysis in taking adequate actions to ensure global peace, veto reforms are necessary.
- Suggestion- abolishing veto is not feasible, therefore it is suggested that the scope of its usage should be limited to when the core national interest of the p5 countries is involved.
- UNGA should have the power to override individual members of p5 in case of the deadlock of a case by a special majority. 
- PROCEDURAL REFORMS: better coordination in UNGA, transparency in its functioning, UNSC should consult troop-contributing countries in peacekeeping operations.

**India's Candidature of permanent membership  (03:15 pm )**

- It will be a global acknowledgment of India's great power status.
- permanent members of the UNSC have a say in the internal functioning of the UN.

- However, the political analyst is apprehensive about any UNSC membership reform in the near future. In such a situation, India should rather focus on its internal development in terms of economy, technology, military, rather than spend its diplomatic energy in pursuit of the elusive goal

- It allows the use of money, weapon, technology-driven military operations, and even non-state actors.
- However this Doval doctrine has been a failure, since its adoption of the Pulwama attack in Feb.2019, which has been the largest military attack so far.
- A vehicle-borne suicide bomber attacked a convoy of CRPF vehicles, killing 40 CRPF men.
- This for India, brought India-Pakistan relations to their lowest point.
- India in retaliation launched a Balakot air strike targeting the training facilities of Jaish-e -Mohmad (JEM), in   khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
- August 5th, 2019, India abrogated article 370(suspended special status to J&K) and bifurcated the state of j&k into 2 UT.
- With it India-Pakistan relationship went to its lowest.
- Following Pulwama, India has withdrawn MFN status to Pakistan.
- While abrogation of 370, Pakistan suspended all trade ties.
-   
    
- **Downgraded their diplomatic missions:          (07:26 PM)**
- Recalled their High commissioners and reduced their mission strength to half.
- There are no high level talks between Indian and Pakistan PM.
- Exceptions of faith based travel.
- Consequently the relationship has reached one of the lowest point since independence.
- **However both India and Pakistan are taking steps to change such a status quo :      (07:38 PM )**
- 1. Agreement to ensure ceasefire at Loc: held firm. 
- There is ongoing coordination between military personnel and diplomats involved.
- 2. The importance of cross-border trade is highlighted in speeches of Pakistani Pm and military general Qamar Bajwa.
- 3. Absence of a very adverse statement in Pakistan for India.
- 4. Two years of suspension, is restored.
- 5. Messages on social media and letters were exchanged between PM Modi and the new Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, on the revival of India-Pakistan realtions.
- Pakistan has allowed the export of wheat to Afghanistan through Pakistan via the world food program since Feb 2022.
- **Reasons for such a change:       (07:45 PM)**
- Open hostility has subsided even if it has not vanished completely.
- On the part of India :
- 1. The border crisis on Ladakh raised the probability of a collusive military threat between China and Pakistan.
- Such a challenge cannot be effectively dealt with by the Indian military.
- 2. On part of Pakistan, the severe economic crisis that Pakistan finds itself in has made it rethink its national security paradigm from purely military defence to economic security.
- Military general, Qamar Bazwa said, that it is a rational choice, to see South Asia in terms of geo-economic integration, rather than geo-strategic rivalries.
- Pakistan has been a financial assistance-dependent economy.
- Following the USA withdrawal from Afghanistan, and west Asian economies(Saudi Arabia and UAE), undertaking economic restructuring, financial assistance is not as forthcoming.
- While IMF has extended loans but only with tough conditions, which made Imran khan's government unpopular.
- (tough condition: increase in electricity tariff, withdrawal of income tax exemptions, the free central bank from government control).
- On the other hand, while China is willing but Islamabad is wary of borrowing too much from Beijing for its debt traping policies.
- With the new government of Shebaz Sharif in Pakistan, there are speculations of the revival of bilateral ties.
- However one cannot be sure and it is too early to predict the normalization/revival of the India-Pakistan relationship.

**Topics for the next class:** Does India have a Pakistan policy? What should be the GoI approach? Bilateral issues.
 
# International Relations Class 08
 
**Brief Recap of the previous class discussion                                     (01:11:00 PM)**  
**What helped in the thawing of the relation of India-Pakistan Relations around 2020.       (01:16:00 PM)**

- The immediate step was the back channel diplomacy at the NSA level between India and Pakistan and this was mediated by the UAE.
- The ceasefire agreement was signed.
- It tried to normalize the relationship between the two countries.

**Does India have a policy with respect to Pakistan?**

- Indian elites have been dismissive of Pakistan.
- India’s forefathers failed to understand the true nature and resilience of Pakistan.
- They often predicted that Pakistan as a statehood would eventually rejoin India (Jawaharlal Nehru).
- But the Pakistani State created as a Muslim country in opposition to so-called Hindu India despite its own partition and economic precariousness has survived.
- In absence of the belief in the survival of Pakistan, the Indian elite failed to formulate a coherent, and cogent foreign policy with respect to it.
- It is an irony that though almost every Prime Minister of India has dealt with the issue of Pakistan personally, India has been unable to manage its relations with it.
- India’s relationship with Pakistan follows the vicious cycle of dialogue-disruption-dialogue.
- Every new government in India early on its enthusiastic about improving India-Pakistan relations to having such steps disrupted by an attack on India.
- It is followed by a freeze in the relationship, that by the time they realised that hostility is futile that it is time for the next general election and a change in the government or party in the power. 
**Evaluating the option of animosity with Pakistan                                   (01:54:00 PM)**

- Stopping the flow of Indus water to Pakistan is neither feasible nor advisable.
- Withdrawal of MFN status did not create the necessary impact since the bilateral nature of trade remains quite low.
- Internationally isolating Pakistan is easier said than done.
- Given the strategic location of Pakistan, near Iran, Central Asia, Afghanistan, and the Indian Ocean it is considered as the pivot state in international politics.
- Thus it can never be successfully isolated in international politics.
- Russian Scholars call Pakistan a zipper state which connects Europe and Asia.
- China is closer to Pakistan than ever before. Russia is warming up to it and for the US despite its withdrawal from Afghanistan Pakistan is important to access Afghanistan.
- Such close relations of Pakistan with global powers make it difficult to internationally isolate Pakistan.

**Evaluating option of Peace with Pakistan                            (2:18:00 PM)**

- Peace with Pakistan is not a choice but a compulsion as rightly commented by our former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee “Friends can be changed but not the neighbours who have to live together.
- However, the moment India engaged in peace with Pakistan it become vulnerable to terror attacks.
- Also, CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) will alter “the logic of geography”.
- It will reduce Pakistan’s economic dependence on India and it would have less motivation to normalize its relations with India.

**Therefore following could be the possibility**

- India should pursue the back channel diplomacy.
- India should improve its relations with countries that have leverage with Pakistan like UAE, Saudi Arabia, USA.
- India should develop international communities' stake in the Indian economy.
- It will be the biggest hedge in terror attacks.
- India should try to get the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) passed at the UN earlier.
- Most Importantly at the domestic level, India should maintain the spirit of India.
- Pakistan can wind against India only if it is able to destroy the secular composite nature of India.
- Thus India needs to prevent the radicalization of its youth and a politically imaginative solution to J&K vis-à-vis Kashmir.

**Bilateral Issues between India and Pakistan                 (02:52:00 PM)**  
**Reason for the persistence of the Kashmiri Issue**

- Kashmir became a matter of identity issue for both India and Pakistan.
- Kashmir as the Muslim majority region, and continued its integration with India will strengthen India’s credential as a secular country.
- On the other hand, its integration with Pakistan will reinforce the idea of Pakistan's statehood, i.e. religion as the basis of the nation.
- Kashmir’s Strategic location is in the vicinity of Central Asia, Pakistan, and China.
- Rich in water resources Himalayas is regarded as water towers of South Asia.

**The solution to the Kashmir Issue**

- **Conducting Plebiscite in Kashmir:** Pakistan insists on it, though originally suggested by UN as the part of the 1949 ceasefire agreement, it could not be conducted since Pakistan did not withdraw its forces from the ceasefire line.
- Presently India rejects it (plebiscite) as the demography of the region has changed with PoK under Pakistan for more than 70 years.
- **Third-Party Mediation:** India rejects it since it is a violation of the Shimla Agreement, 1972.
- The long-term solution to the Kashmir dispute can be found only in politically imaginative suggestions.
- Former PM Atal Bihar Vajpayee had suggested that any solution to the Kashmir dispute has to be found under the paradigm of Insaniyat (Humanity), Jamhuriyat (Democracy), and Kashmiriyat (Kashmiri Identity).
- Former PM Manmohan Singh along with his Pakistani counterpart Pavez Musharraf had reportedly developed an understanding to convert LoC into a soft border which would include joint patrolling of the border, demilitarisation of the region, and free movement of people goods, and services across the LoC.
- However, before such a solution could be implemented the process of dialogue was disrupted by Mumbai Terror Attack 2008 in India and consequently, Mussaraf was removed from his political office.
- Presently Government of India has abrogated Article 370 and bifurcated the State into two Union territories bringing Kashmir under the direct control of the Union government.
- Though it is a step to ensure peace in the valley, violence has reasons in the country.
- It is a step to control cross-border sponsored Kashmir militancy following the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.

**Pakistan insists on**

- Grant of statehood and No change in the demography of the valley are essential pre-condition for the resumption of India-Pakistan relations.
- The long-term solution to peace in the valley will be borne in out of box solutions or creative solutions to the Kashmir dispute.

**Gilgit Baltistan Issue                    (03:32:00 PM)**

- For this sub-topic notes handout will be uploaded.

**Sia Chen Glacier                   (03:41:00PM)**

- For this sub-topic notes handout will be uploaded.
- Ambiguous text of the Karachi Agreement.
- The fixation of the NJ9842. Beyond that, the ceasefire line moved northwards.
- For Indian northward movement means along the Saltoro ridge.
- For Pakistan, the points move northeast and meet the Karakoram pass.
- Indian Government alleged that Pakistan is adopting Oro politics and Cartographic aggression.
- Shimla Agreement reiterated the Karachi agreement.
- Siachen is known as the third pole of the world. It is the largest non-polar glacier.
- It is the source of the Nubra and Shyok rivers.
- Siachen glacier is located in the eastern Karakoram range. It is the world’s highest battlefield.
- Through Operation Meghdoot India captured Siachen.
- With Siachen under its control, India can prevent pincer attacks.
- However, the military utility of the Sia-Chen is still debated.
- Former PM Manmohan Singh suggested converting the Sia-Chen into a mountain of Peace. It should be used as a scientific experiment by both countries.

**Sir Creek Issue                          (03:56:00 PM)**

- For this sub-topic notes handout will be uploaded.
- It is considered as the low-hanging fruit to resolve.
- It is the disputes that pre-date the partition of India.
- Para 09 and Para 10 as per 1914 agreement.
- For India red line should be the border. However, Pakistan objects to it as a water body.

**Indus Water Treaty               (04:05:00 PM)**   

- It is considered as the most successful treaty of the world.
- It divided the Indus river into the two-part.
- Western Rivers were given to Pakistan and three Eastern rivers were given to India.
- However, the other part can use the water in a restrictive manner such as the non-consumptive purposes.
- **As per the Brahma Chellany, IWT** is the very unique treaty that any upper riparian country will agree with it.
- India agreed as per the historical context that India was weak.
- If India plan for any non-consumptive use in the Western river allotted to Pakistan, Pakistan has veto power.
- As per the Indian PM Modi “Water and blood cannot flow together”.

**The topic for the next class discussion:** India-Afghanistan Relations
 
# International Relations Class 09
 
**India- Afghanistan relations: (1:10 PM):**  
**Some expected questions:**

- Discuss the redefining of India’s role in Afghanistan.
- Despite all that India has done in Afghanistan over the past twenty years since the Taliban were ousted from Kabul in 2001, India finds itself on the margins of international diplomacy in Afghanistan.

Afghanistan represents a treacherous terrain where even angels fear to tread. एक पंख से चिड़िया उड़ती है दूसरे से अपनी इज़्ज़त बचाती है।

- History bears testimony to the fact that whenever an empire tried to conquer Afghanistan, it marked the beginning of its decline, be it the Soviet Union, Colonial British empire, or the current global hegemon USA.

**Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan 1979:**

- Soviet had propped up a puppet communist government in Afghanistan.
- India had close relations with that communist government.
- This created a **security dilemma** for Pakistan which had by then lost two conventional wars with India.
- As the USA grew apprehensive of increasing Soviet footprint, it started training religious fighters called **Mujahideens** along with Pakistan, to topple the communist government.

|   |
|---|
|**Pakistan’s Afghanistan policy(1:30 PM):**  <br>To seek strategic depth in Afghanistan or in other words, Pakistan wants to have a puppet government in Afghanistan because:<br><br>- Pakistan suffers from a **security dilemma**( the source of threat is another country) and it is fearful that in case of a war with India if India has good relations with Afghanistan, it may open a second front against Pakistan.<br>- Pakistan also faces an **insecurity dilemma**( the source of threat is within the country, as the separatist demands of Pashtuns.<br>- The Durand Line is an imperial border drawn by the Britishers that had artificially divided the Pashtuns on either side of the Afghanistan - Pakistan border.<br>- These Pashtuns want to unify and create a Greater Pashtunistan. <br>![Wakhan Corridor Durand line UZBEK TAJIKISTAN TURKM...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061557-0.gif)|

- By 1989, the Mujahideens were able to drive USSR out of Afghanistan.
- The primary reason was believed to be played by the **Stringer missiles**(shoulder-mounted rockets).
- However, the communist **Najibullah** government continued in Afghanistan.
- A civil war had started in Afghanistan which lasted till 1992 when the Mujahideens came to power.
- India despite its apprehensions, recognized the Mujahideen government and established diplomatic relations with it.
- The government was very highly influenced by the Pakistani establishment.
- Mujahideens soon started asserting their independence from Pakistan and started seeking good relations with India.
- Islamabad’s security dilemma vis-a-vis India continued.
- Therefore they chose to train another group of religious fighters in the radical  **Wahhabi** ideology against the Mujahideens, which later grew into the Taliban.
- A civil war broke out again in Afghanistan and in 1996, the Taliban ousted the Mujahideen.
- The Taliban government was recognized by only three countries in the world- Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and UAE.
- All three countries' elites have maintained kinship ties for a long time.
- Taliban controlled more than two-thirds of the Afghan territory.
- **Northern Alliance(NA)** was formed in late 1996 by the key leaders of Afghan society to resist the Taliban.
- The president of the Northern Alliance was **Burhanuddin Rabbani**.
- It fought a defensive war against the Taliban and received support from key regional players including Iran, Russia, India, etc.
- India recognized the Northern Alliance as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.
- They operated from the Panjshir valley, northern Afghanistan.
- Ahmed Shah Masood was a charismatic leader of the alliance hailing from the Panjshir valley

**9/11 Attack on the twin towers in the USA (1:57 PM):**

- Despite being a  prominent participant in both the world wars, USA mainland territory had never been attacked.
- Even **Pearl Harbor** lay in Hawaii, and not on the mainland.
- More than the unprecedented human tragedy, it was a severe blow to the image of the USA as the USA by then had firmly cemented its position as the global hegemon.
- The global war on terror was launched by **George** **Bush** with the message that" You are either with us or against us".
- The USA chose Pakistan over India as a partner in the mission due to the inevitable role Pakistan can play regarding supplies due to being coterminous with Afghanistan.
- Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda was given a safe haven by the Taliban, and hence the Taliban regime was attacked.
- By 2001, the Taliban was ousted from Kabul, and **Hamid Karzai** was instilled as the interim President of Afghanistan.
- He was later elected as the president.
- **Ashraf Ghani** came to power in 2014 and stayed till 2019.
- The global war on terror was fought by the NATO-led **International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF).**
- Taliban had offered to surrender to the USA back in 2001, which the USA had refused.
- The USA had then overestimated the Taliban retreat from Kabul and was under impression that it can fully exterminate the Taliban.
- On 15th August 2021, the Taliban again occupied Kabul.

**Taliban withstood the assaults all the years because :**

- Unlike any state, it is difficult to defeat a non-state actor, engaged in the insurgency.
- Such actors can get dismantled and regrouped any number of times at different places with maybe different leaders and participants.
- Pakistan, a major Non-Nato Ally continued to provide safe havens and leak intelligence.

**USA's approach to the Afghan mission later:**

- President Barrack Obama had distinguished Iraq war as an evil war, while the war in Afghanistan was a necessary war.
- December 2014- NATO’s **Operation Combat** ( Direct conflict between ISAF and Taliban) ends
- January 2015- Nato then started the **Operation Resolute Support** started to provide training and support to the Afghan forces.
- Similar to Obama’s strategy, in  2017, President Donald Trump launched a new Af-Pak policy aimed at breaking the military stalemate by sanctioning an additional  5000 soldiers.
- The USA forces were given a free hand to go after the Taliban, and Pakistan was identified as a key reason behind the prolonging of the war.
- Pakistan was told to mend its ways or lose financial assistance.
- Pakistan which was vital for supplies continued to share intelligence.
- However in July 2018, in view of the impending USA presidential elections, as well as the failure of strategy reversed his position. 

|   |
|---|
|Taliban joke- You have the watches, we have time|

- Insurgencies and non-state actors that enjoy safe havens are impossible to defeat.
- Thus in 2019, he appointed **Zalmay Khalilzad** as the special representative to Afghanistan with the mandate to end the ongoing war and withdraw USA forces.

Consequently, **three-way negotiations** were started:

- The **Doha Track** between **USA and Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan( Taliban),**even when the USA had not recognized the Taliban.
- The **Kabul Track** between the **USA and the Afghan government** to ensure that Afghanistan would accept the outcome.
- The **Rawalpindi track** between the **USA** and **Pakistan** for smooth and timely withdrawal.

**The original four objectives were:**

- Total ceasefire from Taliban till the USA withdrawal was complete.
- The Taliban must cut all ties with terrorism.
- The Taliban must be engaged in an Intra-Afghan dialogue for peaceful withdrawal and governance of Afghan later on.
- Complete withdrawal of USA troops withdrawal.

Since Pakistan and the Taliban negotiated as a team, consequently the objectives were wilted down to just USA troops withdrawal, and some reference to the Taliban cutting ties with the terrorist groups.

- Taliban was adamant that it would participate in any Intra-Afghan dialogue only after the USA withdrawal.
- Finally, in **February 2020**, the **Doha deal** was finalized, and in **September 2021**, an Intra Afghan dialogue process commenced.
- With Joseph Biden’s election as the president, he finalized September 2021 as the final date for USA’s complete withdrawal.
- However the process was completed earlier, and on 15th August 2021, the Taliban once again took over.
- The USA in the Doha talks committed to releasing 5000 Taliban fighters fatally undermined the process.The 
- The USA was perceived to be desperate for a quick withdrawal and seemed to accept any situation.
- Even while the talks were going on, the Taliban was not only regrouping militarily, but it also continued to attack USA establishments and forces.

**Analysis of the events (2:31 PM):**

- As the USA was withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan, the Taliban continued with its military advances; the intra-Afghan dialogue remained at an impasse.
- Ashraf Ghani’s flight from Kabul while the USA was undertaking its evacuation process only ensured the peaceful fall of Kabul.
- It ended USA’s longest war, but for the Afghans, a new chapter of uncertainty has opened up.
- With a severe deficit in finances, material, and trained human resources, governance of the country seemed very difficult, and till now, Afghanistan remains dependent on external aid.
- Two days after the Taliban occupied Kabul, the Indian government closed its embassy and evacuated its personnel from the country.

**Taliban in Afghanistan, again:**

- Though it promised to be a moderate variant and its transformation into a moderate political entity, its initial decisions such as changing the name of the country to the **Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan**, bringing back the old flag, stopping girls' education, asking female newsreaders to wear Naqabs,  ministerial posts being assigned to the old hardline clerics, it seems that not much has changed within Taliban.
- However, the Taliban has in fact promised Pakistan, China, and Russia that it will prevent the use of Afghan soil for any attacks, but groups such as the Islamic State (Khorasan) –IS-K, Al Qaeda, Lashkar-E –Taiba, Jaish E Mohammad, East Turkestan Islamic Movement, etc continue to be present in the Afghan soil, and all these groups share Salafi Jihadi ideology.
- Thus, it would be difficult to keep up with the commitments.
- Taliban’s ideology does not seem to have changed much.

**The reaction of the World to the USA’s exit(2:52 PM):**

-  India has been cautious about USA’s exit fearing violence and insecurity in the region.
- For the last five years, Russia, China, Iran, and Pakistan had been vocal in calling for the USA to leave.
- They describe USA’s continued presence as the cause of violent instability.
- Pakistan’s triumphalism was evident as the ISI chief’s visit to Kabul to resolve the differences over power-sharing among different factions enabled the announcement of the first cabinet list by the Taliban.
- With the world reacting to the Taliban takeover in varied ways, Afghanistan is fast moving towards being a failed state.

**India’s role in Afghanistan (3:20 PM):**

- India and Afghanistan have shared close cultural, civilizational, and political ties.
- Following the ouster of the Taliban regime in 2001, India reopened its embassy.
- It found a welcoming environment with the Northern Alliance leaders holding key ministerial posts.

**Nature of India’s engagement:**  
India’s engagement with Afghanistan since 2001 has been limited to state-building efforts and its engagement in the security sector was minimal.  
**The reasons behind this:**

- This was primarily due to USA’s sensitivities as it was dependent upon Pakistan for communications and supply lines.
- It was on the insistence of the USA catering to Pakistan’s security dilemma vis- a- vis India that India’s military role in Afghanistan was limited.
- Indian state & its foreign policy; which is uncomfortable with military footprints in a foreign country.

**Pieces of evidence of India’s engagement:**

- India became Afghanistan's biggest regional development partner.
- During the last two decades, it has committed **$ 3.1 billion** in economic assistance., and around a million tonnes of wheat.
- Establishing Children’s Hospital.
- Building Afghan Parliament.
- Building Salma Dam, which is also known as India- Afghanistan Friendship dam.
- Habiba girls high school.
- Running half a dozen medical camps.
- Providing prosthetics, etc. India built power transmission lines enabling electricity import from Uzbekistan.
- Cold Storage units for local agricultural produce.
- Over a thousand Afghan students receive scholarships every year for college education, and an equal number entered into short-term courses in Information Technology, management, accounting, and basic skilling courses like refrigeration, plumbing, carpentry, etc.
- The UNDP partnered with India to train Afghan civil servants.
- To strengthen local governance, India funded over four hundred small developmental projects implemented by NGOs at the district level.
- As a landlocked country, Afghanistan was dependent on the **Karachi port** for sea access.
- To break such dependence on a single country, India undertook the development of Chabahar port in Iran and also built 200 kilometres **Zaranj- Delaram** highway in Afghanistan to connect it to the Iranian border town of **Zahedan**.
- This would revive Afghanistan’s traditional role as the cross-road connecting South Asia, Central Asia, and West Asia.
- India spearheaded Afghanistan’s membership in **SAARC**.
- In 2011, India became the first country with which Afghanistan signed Strategic Partnership Agreement.
- India has become the largest destination of high-value Afghan imports since the launch of the bilateral air freight corridor.
- India is the **fifth-largest** donor to Afghanistan in the world.
- The nature of Indian assistance has been acknowledged as better value for money than the traditional aid.
- Thus, India’s efforts have earned widespread goodwill among the Afghan population.
- But despite this goodwill, India finds itself at the margins of international diplomacy.

**Evidence of India being ignored for the post-USA scenario (3:50 PM):**

- UN Secretariat organized a meeting on Afghanistan of what it calls the **6+2+1** group.
- It comprises 6 physical neighbours of Afghanistan –Iran, Pakistan, China, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
- 2 global players: USA and Russia.
- And Afghanistan itself
- India was conspicuous by its absence.
- Other regional dialogue processes in Afghanistan such as the first **Moscow Dialogue,** etc also have no Indian participation.
- The third regional security dialogue at the NSA level was held in New Delhi in September 2021.
- It was an Iranian initiative that saw the participation of NSAs- Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan.
- There were two significant absentees- Pakistani and Chinese NSAs did not participate.
- Though the Russian NSA participated, he commented that “multiple dialogue mechanisms would complicate the unfolding situation in Taliban controlled Afghanistan”.

**Reasons:**

- Though the public reason for the non-inclusion of India in the 6+2+1 meeting was that India does not share physical borders with Afghanistan, however, India’s reluctance to engage with the Taliban has resulted in its non-inclusion in such initiatives.
- India has vital strategic stakes in the evolving political scenario in Afghanistan.
- But for the longest time, India has insisted on **Afghan-led- Afghan Owned and Afghan Controlled** dialogue process and continues to not recognize or engage in direct dialogue with the Taliban.

**The topics for the next class:** What should be India’s strategy going forward, Heart of Asia conference, India-Nepal, India- Bangladesh relations.
 
# International Relations Class 10
 
**Revision of the last class (1:05 PM):**  
Pakistan’s overt Afghanistan strategy is to gain strategic depth in Afghanistan, but its overt aim is to instil a puppet/stooge government in Kabul.  
**India has been on the margins during the Afghan deliberations**.

- The official reason given is that India does not share borders with Afghanistan.
- But experts believe that this is because of India’s reluctance/inability to open dialogue channels with the Taliban.

**Options before India (1:15 PM):**

- India must look for engaging with the Taliban.
- Having a communication channel is necessary to avoid another IC-814 type incident.
- Also unlike the Taliban takeover of 1996, this time all the major powers have well-defined channels of communication with the Taliban, all in public information.

**Present status:**

- We have not recognised the Taliban government, and our embassy remains closed.
- India insists that the Afghan soil must not be used for any terrorist activities against any country.
- India’s approach towards Afghanistan continues to be guided by the key elements of **UNSC Resolution 2593** that was adopted during India’s presidency of the Global body.

|   |
|---|
|**Key elements of UNSC 2593 Resolution:**<br><br>- Need for upholding human rights in Afghanistan.<br>- Afghan territory should not be used for terrorism.<br>- A negotiated political settlement should be found to the political crisis.|

**India must be clear on its role in the Taliban-led Afghanistan, and it must consider:** 

- Global, as well as regional powers, have recognised, unlike during the first tenure of the Taliban.
- Be it the USA, Russia, China, Iran, and Central Asian Republics all have opened communication channels as well as their embassies in Talibanized Afghanistan.
- Afghanistan is a key country in India’s neighbourhood, as well as a key determinant of the security of India.
- India cannot prolong the dialogue or recognise the Taliban.
- Learning from its past mistakes of how the Talibanized Afghanistan was used by the Indian Airline's hijackers to strand the highjacked plane at Kandahar and bargain with the Government of India, India cannot afford closed channels of communication with those in power in Afghanistan.
- If it were to do so, it would be at the cost of Its own security.
- Also, it would give Pakistan a free run with the Taliban.

**India has already shown some inclinations toward reaching out to the Taliban:**

-  In September 2020, the Indian Minister for External Affairs addressed the inaugural session of the **Intra-Afghan dialogue.** 
- This was for the first time that an Indian official addressed a gathering that includes the Taliban.
- Also, the joint statement of the **Third Regional Security Dialogue** at the NSA level was well received by the Taliban despite it not being invited to the dialogue.
- Also, the Taliban has also insisted on continued humanitarian assistance from India.
- The Taliban have repeatedly suggested that they would welcome the reopening of the embassy by India.
- Given the influence of the **Haqqani Network** and by extension, the **ISI**, the Indian government is unwilling to take any chances with the Taliban

|   |
|---|
|The **Haqqani Network** is an important armed component of the Taliban. It had earlier targeted the Indian embassy and personnel.|

- However, unlike west India is part of the region and cannot disengage.
- It has responded to the humanitarian calls by offering 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat, and urgent medical supplies.
- Pakistan has also allowed its land for transit.

**Conclusion (1:44 PM):**

- Given the Indian apprehension of Taliban, but being part of the region, it cannot disengage with Talian at all.
- Thus, the likely middle path to be adopted by the government of India would be to ensure diplomatic engagement with Afghanistan through **Doha( Political Office of Taliban)** and through forums where Pakistan cannot veto India's presence.
- Also, given India’s regional leadership goals, it can not be excluded from the evolving political situation in Afghanistan.
- Through engagement with the Taliban, India can secure what the **Minister of External Affairs** referred to as **“Double Peace”**, which encompasses peace within Afghanistan and peace around Afghanistan.

**Notes:**

- India’s development partnership with Afghanistan has included more than 500 projects spread across each of the 34 provinces of the country in critical areas such as – power, water supply, road connectivity, healthcare, education, agriculture and capacity building.
- All the India projects have been based on demands raised by Afghanistan and have been implemented at the district level making a real impact on the lives of the people.
- It has earned a lot of goodwill for India.
- Except for Pakistan, all other players in Afghanistan including the Taliban recognised the impact of India’s developmental cooperation.
- Pakistan and Afghanistan are assumed to be conjoined twins, in the sense that any development in either nation is reflected in the another in one way or another.
- When all the major powers were vying for a strategic partnership with Afghanistan, **Hamid Karzai** chose India.
- The strategy was changed by **Ashraf Ghani**.
- Ashraf Ghani chose **Rawalpindi( Headquarters of the Pakistani Army and ISI)**over Islamabad, possibly due to the influence of the Haqqani Network.

**Heart of Asia Summit (2:05 PM):**

- It was jointly launched by Afghanistan and Turkey in 2011 to encourage Afghanistan neighbouring countries to play a constructive role in establishing peace and stability in Afghanistan and consequently achieve regional stability.
- It recognises that a stable and secure Afghanistan is vital for the region.
- It allows Afghanistan to set its own agenda from a regional perspective.
- The first conference was held in 2011 in Istanbul, and the second one was held in Kabul in 2012.
- The sixth conference was held in Amritsar in 2016 and the most recent one was held in Dushanbe (Tajikistan) in 2021.
- It has 15 member countries and supporting organisations.

For example- India –Japan vis-a-vis the navigational  freedom of the Indo-Pacific)|
 
**India Nepal (2:30 PM):**

- Bhutan and Maldives (Excluding a brief period under Abdulla Yameen) are the two South Asian countries with whom India had maintained consistent good relations.
- Except for them, we don’t have consistent good relations with the rest of South Asia, including Nepal.
- In Nepal, anti-Indian sentiment and their expressions have been a barometer of their patriotism.
- KP Oli used and professed Anti-India sentiments throughout his prime ministerial campaign and won. 

**The unpreceded closeness between the two countries can be seen through :**

- As close neighbours, India and Nepal share a unique relationship characterised by open borders and deep-rooted people-people contact.
- A long tradition of free movement of people across the borders, sharing family ties and cultural relations.
- India-Nepal denotes “Roti-Beti ka Rishta” which is indicative of the tradition of interdining, similarity of cuisine as well as cross-border marriages.
- **Madhesis** of the Terai- Indian origin people who married and settled there.
- The cultural connection between the two countries runs from **Lumbini** to **Bodh Gaya** and **Pashupatinath** to **Kashi Vishwanath**.
- Nepal was a Hindu state between **1962-2015**.
- The **Shah dynasty** has been ruling Nepal from 1769 until 2008.
- They were originally Sisodia Rajputs of Rajasthan.
- The prominent languages of Nepal include Nepali, Maithili and Bhojpuri, and all are rooted in Indian languages-Sanskrit, Pali and Hindi.
- Even geographically, the **Terai** region of Nepal runs into the Northern plains of India, forming a contiguous geographic region.
- Nepal has a total population of 29 million of which 7 million live and work in India.
- The unprecedented closeness is also evident in the Indian Army having a **Gorkha regiment** that recruits Nepali Gorkhas.
- Such an unprecedented closeness has led foreign policy expert **S. D Muni** to comment that the two countries are **"lodged in each other’s intestines”.**

The irony is that despite such closeness, the relations remain fraught with **challenges.**  
**Why?:**

- As India has grave security issues with respect to China, India does not have an independent Nepal policy.
- Our Nepal policy is in fact a subset of India’s China policy.
- India seeks to micromanage affairs in Nepal and hence our policy is comparable to that of Pakistan in Afghanistan.
- Such is our insecurity that the First Prime Minister of India **Mr Nehru** had no hesitation in declaring in the Indian parliament on **6****th** **December 1950**  that- “India’s security will enjoy primacy over Nepal’s sovereignty.”
- He added that India cannot accept Nepal’s policy of equidistance with respect to India and China, and Nepal must prioritise its relations with India.
- Following the Chinese annexation of Tibet, both India and Nepal wanted to preserve the special relations that Nepal had with British India, that is India sought to make Nepal a buffer state to prevent China’s direct access to the Indian Gangetic plains.
- However Nepal is too big a country( 45th largest country in the world, twice the size of Sri Lanka) It is too proud of its non-colonial history, to be a vassal state.

**Political instability in Nepal (3:15 PM):**

- Nepal’s polity has been pillared- Nepal has seen different powers centres- Royalty, Rana(Prime Ministers to the Royalty), Maoists and the Parliament.
- In its short modern history, it has seen five formal constitutions and two interim constitutions.
- India followed a multi-pillared strategy and thus could not win the trust of any section(pillar) in Nepal.
- Political instability prevented India from developing a coherent foreign policy vis-a-vis Nepal.￼￼**Lack of professionalism in India’s approach:**
- Most of the Indian ambassadors have been from the state of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, who more often than not have kinship relations across the border.
- Thus, they failed to present a neutral perspective of the ground realities in Nepal.
- Rather than building domestic democratic institutions in Nepal, India has supported individuals who could serve as Indian stooges/puppets.
- Delay, and at times failure in the implementation of the promised projects hampered many economic and strategic interests of India.
- This has opened the space for instance China in the hydropower sector in Nepal.
- India has often overlooked diplomatic protocols while engaging with Nepal.
- The **Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950** was signed by **Nepali Prime Minister** on one hand and the **Indian Ambassador** on the other.
- This has hurt Nepal’s ego.
- Nepal’s founder **Prithvinarayan Shah** described Nepal as a “Yam between two boulders”, given Nepal’s geostrategic position of being landlocked between the two Asian giants India and China.
- Thus Nepal has always insisted on pursuing a diversified foreign policy while India insists that it should prioritise its relations with India.

**Bilateral issues between India and Nepal :**  
**1950 Peace and Friendship Treaty:**  
**Context:**

- Since mid 19th century, Tibet has served as a buffer to China. 
- This role of the buffer passed over to Nepal after the Chinese annexation of Tibet.
- It became empirical for Delhi to deny China access to Nepal because of the vulnerability of India’s northern plains.
- Also, Nepal wanted to revive the special relations it had with British India following its own insecurity vis–a–vis expansionist China.

**Provisions of the treaty:**

- India recognises Nepal as a sovereign state.
- National treatment of each other’s citizens in terms of employment including public employment.
- However, India has relinquished its right to public sector employment in Nepal.
- Nepal will give primacy to India in infrastructure development including hydropower projects as well as vis-à-vis other business opportunities.

**Problems with the treaty:**

- There exists no dispute with respect to the provisions of the treaty.
- The problem lies in the secret letters that were exchanged along with the treaty.

**The problematic provisions include:**

- Both countries shall not tolerate any act of aggression against one another.
- Nepal shall not import arms from any other country, except India, without Indian permission and provided that India is unable to fulfil Nepalese requirements.

**Nepalese criticism of the treaty:**

- It violates Nepalese sovereignty since India interferes in its internal matters, especially in its foreign and defence policy.
- Since the treaty was signed with the Ranas of Nepal who did not enjoy Nepalese public goodwill, the treaty lacks legitimacy.
- Nepal claims that India gets disproportionate benefits from the treaty.

**Way forward:**

- Given the fact that the treaty has been used to incite anti-India sentiments in Nepal by the Nepali politicians, India should, like its treaty with Bhutan, revise this treaty as well (revised in 2007).
- In fact, Nepal draws substantive benefits under the treaty since it allows for open borders between the two countries and Nepali citizens to seek work in India without any work permit, to apply for government jobs, and civil services( except**IAS, IPS, IFS**) and purchase property.
- The provisions of the secret letter which require Nepal to consult India on its defence requirements have been violated a number of times.
- In fact, the open borders are used by Pakistan to infiltrate terrorists and pump in a significant amount of fake currencies into India.
- Thus, every time in the past when India agreed to review the treaty, Nepali politicians side-stepped.
- In fact revision of the treaty is more of a political issue, rather than representing a genuine grievance of Nepal.
- However, in 2018 the Eight-Person **Eminent Persons Group** was officially mandated to look into the issue.
- It finalised its report in 2018 with its recommendations vis-à-vis the revision of the treaty, but it has not been officially adopted as yet.

**The topics for the next class:** River disputes- Susta, Kalapani, Demonetisation, China in Nepal, India- Bangladesh relations.
 
# International Relations Class 11
 
**Revision: (13:12)**

- India and Nepal relationships.
- Provisions of treaties in past between India and Nepal.
- Nepalese working in India.

**Hydro-electric Power projects: (13:15)**

- Nepal has a hydroelectric power potential of 83,000 Megawatts of electricity, of which feasible at the current level of technology is 40,000 Megawatts of power.
- Nepal manages to produce around 1,000 Megawatts of electricity.
- It results in a severe power shortage in Nepal with power cuts in the capital city Kathmandu as well.
- In fact every year, Nepal imports 600 Megawatts of electricity from India.
- Such is their reluctance to cooperate with India on hydroelectric power projects that their potential remains grossly underutilized.
- The optimal harnessing of their hydropower potential could not only meet the domestic demand for power but would also aid Nepal to export the surplus bringing in the necessary forex.

**Nepal’s concerns vis a vis Indian investments in the hydropower sector (13:22)**

- Slow progress and at times and failure to deliver on the promised projects.
- Nepal alleges that India plans large-scale dam-based power projects which are ecologically devastating and geologically unsustainable.
- India insists that Nepal should give primacy to India over the development of such projects on the basis of the peace and friendship treaty. 
- Anti-India attitude is evident in the lack of progress on the game-changing 5000 MW Pancheshwar Hydroelectric Power Project.
- Unlike Nepal, hydroelectric power development cooperation between India and Bhutan is an example of win-win economic diplomacy. 
- Such that HEP is the primary item in the export basket of Bhutan.
- Under this cooperation, India provides finance in the form of grants and loans to establish HEP power projects and then purchases the excess electricity at a low price from India.
- Against India’s insistence on primacy, Nepal wants to issue open tenders to other countries to bid on the projects which would aid in better price discovery.

**Solution/Way forward: (13:41)**

- Under the NDA government led by BJP, India and Nepal have entered into a power trading agreement (2014), which includes joint investments in setting up infrastructure, marketing, and establishment of joint transmission lines.
- They have agreed upon the development of the Arun-III 900 MW Hydroelectric Power Project.
- The Mahakali Treaty signed in 1997 during Deubas’s first visit as prime minister, covers Sarda and Tanakpur barrages as well as the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project. 
- But presently both sides have agreed to push for early finalization of the Detailed Project Report (DPR)
- The ambitious 7 Billion USD project requires political will to move forward. 
- Also, Mr. Deuba has pushed through the ratification of the agreement with the USA’s Millenium Corporation Challenge (MCC) despite the reservation of its coalition partners.
- The Agreement provides for a grant of 500 million USD to support the construction of a high voltage electric power line and upgraded roads. 
- Earlier the opposition to the MCC grant was born out of the fear that the power line project will be linked to India’s electric power grid. 
- Which will increase Kathmandu’s dependence on New Delhi and harm its burgeoning trade partnership with Beijing. 
- The Joint vision statement on power sector cooperation recognizes the opportunities for joint development of power generation projects along with cross-border transmission linkages and coordination between the national grids.

**Territorial Dispute (14:04)**

- India and Nepal share 1850 km long open borders. 
- With 5 Indian states: UP, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Sikkim, and West Bengal.
- 98% of the border is well settled/demarcated. 
- Kalapani and Susta regions remain contested between the two countries.

**Kalapani issue:** 

- This dispute is over a triangular piece of land of 35 Km2.
- This disputed land is located on the India-Nepal-China trijunction.
- This region is enroute to Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.
- India claims this region to be part of the Pitthodgarh district of Uttarakhand, while Nepal claims it to be part of the Dharchula district.
- Source of this dispute: Over the origin of river Kali.
- In 1816 there was Sugauli Treaty, signed between Nepal and the British.
- India claims the origin to lie at Lipu lake.
- Nepal claims it to be in Limpiyadhura.
- The Treaty of Sugauli 1816, mentioned the river Kali to serve as Nepal’s western borders with India.
- However, the origin of the river remains disputed between the two countries.
- According to India, the river Kali originates from a spring in Lipu Lake while Nepal claims the river to originate from Limpiyadhura, north-west of Lipu Lake.
- Thus Nepal makes claim to the entire region.
- Recently in news, facing opposition within his party former prime minister Oli whipped up the nationalist sentiments over the Kalapani area dispute following India releasing a new political map following the bifurcation of the state of J and K into two union territories.
- Former PM Oli got a new political map of Nepal endorsed by the legislature through a constitutional amendment that shows the Kalapani region as a fingerlike projection into India.
- It did not alter the ground situation “only soured the bilateral relations”.

**The importance of Kalapani: (14:23)**

- It is strategically vital since located at a height of 20,000 feet, it serves as a military observation post for India.
- Since the 1962 War.
- It provides a vantage point for the Indian military to observe the activities of Chinese forces along the LAC.
- It is presently manned by ITBP. 
- It is because of such importance of Kalapani, more so, given the recent border conflict between India and China, that resolving the dispute has been difficult.

**Way forward: (14:27).**

- In the spirit of the Gujral Doctrine, India should recognize Kalapani to be Nepali territory but on the condition that Nepal permanently leases it out to India.
- This would, while satisfying the nationalist sentiments in Nepal, would not compromise India’s strategic interest. 

**Susta Territorial Dispute: (14:32)**

- The dispute over Susta is because of changing course of River Gandak.
- When the Treaty of Sugauli was signed Susta was located on the right bank of the river which falls in Nepal.
- But presently, it is located on the left bank, which is part of India.

**Suggested solutions (14:35)**

- The existing bilateral treaties have not taken the shifting courses of Himalayan rivers into consideration.
- India and Nepal should try to resolve it by taking into consideration all the shared environmental characteristics.

**China and Nepal: (14:51)**

- Why does China want its presence in Nepal?
- Why does Nepal want China in Nepal? 
- China’s increasing presence in Nepal.
- What are the hurdles in the China-Nepal relationship?
- Conclusion, way forward.

**Why does China want its presence in Nepal? (14:54)**

- To check India’s influence.
- To check Tibetian activism. 

**Why does Nepal want China?**

- To check the big-brother attitude of India.
- To bolster communist ideology. 
- For economic investments.
- For example, World Bank estimates that 18 billion USD is needed in Nepal for economic growth.
- Chinese influence in Nepal started to grow in 2016 when Trade and Transit Agreement was finalized between China and Nepal.

**Solutions to the issue: (15:18)**

- Distinct foreign policy development between India and Nepal.
- Recent Janakpuri visit by PM of India, promoting religious ties.
- Also a mixture of both soft power and hard powers. 
- India has increased grants to 1 billion USD.
- India can try and balance China’s hard power using soft power.
- Also development and connectivity, e.g. Motihari in Bihar to Kamlekhaganj in Nepal.
- **What is unique about the India-Nepal relationship?**
- People to people ties.
- Good cultural, religious, etc. relations but not at the state level.
- The close people-to-people ties between India and Nepal do not extend at the state-to-state level.
- The reason is that Nepali nationalism is a mask for anti-India sentiments and is the key systemic reason for India and Nepal state to state ties not truly progressing. 
-   
    

**India-Bangladesh Relations: (15:39)**

- Importance of Bangladesh: 
- Longest borders between India and Bangladesh.
- Porous borders are more than 4000 km long.
- Connecting North East India.
- Bangladesh’s location is a strategic wedge between the rest of India and the North-Eastern states. 
- The North-Eastern states are land locked and have a shorter route to the sea through Bangladesh.
- A permanent transit agreement through Bangladesh will overcome India’s Chicken’s Neck Dilemma as well as spur socio-economic development of North East India.
- Bangladesh is the bridge to South-East Asia.
- It is a natural pillar of India’s Act East Policy.
- Dhaka’s support for BIMSTEC and BBIN initiatives complements India’s South-East Asia outreach. 
- For security ‘to contain insurgency in North-East’ as well as securing important sea lines (sea lanes) of communications in the South-Eastern Indian Ocean.

**Phases of India-Bangladesh Relations (15:52)**

- Emphasis will be on the recent phase, or the Golden Phase (Shonali Addhyaya)

**First Phase: (1971-75)**

- Bangladesh was created in 1971, and the role of India was vital in its creation. 
- This is a good phase of bilateral relations. 
- Majibur Rehman, the founding father of Bangladesh was the leader. 
- He led the Mukti Bahini supported by India.
- He founded Awami League.
- Peace, friendship, and cooperation with Bangladesh.
- It is a phase of military rule in Bangladesh, except for a brief phase of democracy under Zia-ur-Rehman. Founder of BNP (Bangladeshi Nationalist Party). 

**Topic of the next class: India-Bangladesh Second Phase (1975-1990) till present.**
 
# International Relations Class 12
 
**Phases of India- Bangladesh (1:16 PM):**

- Unlike Bangladesh’s relations with China which enjoy bipartisan consensus, it is an irony that despite India’s key role in the independence of Bangladesh, India’s relations with it flourish when the **Awami League** is in power, and suffer otherwise.

|   |
|---|
|**Examine whether India-Bangladesh relations are in their golden phase. (250 words/15marks)**  <br>**Introduction:** We can start by briefly mentioning the background(phases of India-Bangladesh relations). We can also bring out the difference with the  China-Bangladesh relations.  <br>**Main body-** We need to discuss two things-<br><br>- Why are the relations now in a golden phase?<br>- Substantiate it with examples.<br><br>**Conclusion**- Yes, the relations are in a golden phase, but some bilateral issues continue to linger. However, we must continue the efforts for cordiality and implement the Gujaral Doctrine in letter and spirit.|

- Indian relations with Bangladesh remained cordial until the 1975 assassination of Bangladesh’s founding president **Sheikh Mujibur Rehman.**
- During the military rule, the relations suffered since the foreign policy of the then military government was primarily based on the strategy of distancing itself from India.
- Since Bangladesh’s return to parliamentary democracy in 1991, the relations have gone through highs and lows depending upon the ruling party.
- It was only after Awami League came to power in 1996 that bilateral relations improved after the long hiatus.
- There was another pause in relations when **Begum Khaleda Zia-**led BNP was in power from 2001-2006. 
- Once Awami League came into power in 2009 under Sheikh Hasina, we find today that the relations have entered a golden phase.
- The relations because of three consecutive terms of the favourable Sheikh Hasina Government have entered into” **Shonali Adhyay”**- the golden chapter of bilateral ties.
- Sheikh Hasina during one of her India visits has described India –Bangladesh relations as “Model good Neighbourliness” as we see now multifaced coop- Health, Environment, People-to-people relations and in non-conventional sectors like peaceful use of civil nuclear energy and maritime cooperation.
- The present External Affairs Minister has commented – India- Bangladesh relations stand out as a model in the region for good neighbourly relations, and very few countries share such close fraternal ties.

**Pieces of evidence of the Golden Phase: (1:45 PM):**  
**Land Border Agreement 2015:**

- India- Bangladesh had entered into a **Land Boundary Pact in 1974** to settle the borders, however, it is only in 2015, that the pact to operationalize it was signed.
- It comprised demarcating 6.5 kilometres of contested borders, settling the issue of **adverse possessions** and the **land enclaves** were swapped allowing the inhabitants to choose their country of residence and become citizens of either India or Bangladesh.
-   
    

|   |
|---|
|**Adverse Possessions:**<br><br>- Indian “adverse possession” refers to territory within Indian control, which is legally part of Bangladesh.<br>- Residents of these adverse possessions are Indian citizens.<br>- The same applies to Bangladeshi adverse possessions.<br>- Though the area is already in Bangladeshi possession, its handing over is merely a procedural acceptance of the de facto situation on the ground.|
|**Land Enclave:**<br><br>- It is a term used for the territory of one state that is completely surrounded by the territory of another state.<br>- It can be understood as a land island of a country, surrounded on all sides by the land ocean of another country.<br>- There were also some Second-degree or Third-degree enclaves which meant a portion of India surrounded by a portion of Bangladesh which was itself surrounded by another portion of India, etc.|

- Though we need no constitutional amendment for settling boundary disputes with other nations, the **100****th** **Constitutional Amendment** was needed due to the issue of Land Enclaves.
- The origin of such a situation is believed to be due to the fact that the  **Maharaja of Cooch Behar** (presently in West Bengal) and **Faujdar of Rangpur** (presently in Bangladesh) wagered on these territories in their chess games and each lost many villages to the other. 
- Earlier in 2014, the **maritime borders** between the two countries were settled.
- India had earlier willingly accepted and did not contest an international tribunal judgement that favoured Bangladesh in a maritime territorial dispute.
- It built bilateral confidence s well as ensured security cooperation and economic development of the Bay of Bengal.
- Once Sheikh Hasina’s government came into power in 2014, it acted against the insurgent groups of North East India who had established camps along the border.
- The arrests of the top insurgent leaders have uprooted insurgency in the Northeast, making the India-Bangladesh border one of the region’s most peaceful.
- It also allows India to make massive redeployment of resources to its more contentious borders with China and Pakistan.
- Bangladesh is our biggest trading partner trade in South Asia with a bilateral trade of **$10 billion,** similar to India-Russia.
- India's second largest trade partner in South Asia is **Sri Lanka** at around $ 3.6 Billion while India- **Pakistan** bilateral trade stands at  $ 2 billion.
- On the development front, cooperation has deepened with India extending three lines of credit to Bangladesh, amounting to $ 8 billion for the construction of roads, railways, bridges and ports. 

**Special emphasis is on connectivity:**

- Direct Bus service between Kolkata and Agartala has been launched that has reduced the distance of travel to 500 KM against 1650 kilometres if it were to run through the C**hicken's Neck (Siliguri Corridor)** of India.
![BAHCLAOESH](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061559-1.png)- Passenger and freight railway services have been bolstered.
- Recently the **Maitree Setu**- a 1.9 km long bridge that connects Sabroon in India with Bangladesh was inaugurated.
- Bangladesh has allowed the use of its Chittogram/Chittagong port and Mongla port to and from India.
- This has allowed the landlocked North East to access the sea.
- Defence cooperation between India and Bangladesh has seen significant progress in the last few years.
- In 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for extending the Line of Credit of $ 500 million for the purchase of defence equipment from India.
- An agreement is more specific and explicit that an MOU.
- Both the nations are making efforts towards institutionalisation of their defence cooperation.  
- The cooperation in the power sector is very significant, as Bangladesh imports 1160 MW of power from India.
- Bangladesh allows withdrawal of 1.8 cusecs of drinking water by **Feni River by Tripura.** 
- **India, Bangladesh and Russia** have entered into a tripartite agreement on the development of the Rooppur nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.
- Bangladesh has sought to join the **India- Myanmar-Thailand** trilateral highway to improve its connectivity with SouthEast Asia and has pushed for the materialisation of the BBIM(Bangladesh- Bhutan-India- Myanmar)  Motor Vehicle Agreement.
- Sheikh Hasina forming the government for the third time provided the two countries with an opportunity to cement the bilateral relations further.
- In this context, both have chalked out a forward-looking road map with the aim to achieve the progress achieved in the bilateral relations irreversible

**Bilateral issues between the two countries (2:33 PM):**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Concerns of Bangladesh**|**Concerns of India**|
|- Adverse balance of trade.<br>- River Water Sharing Agreement.<br>- Rohingya Issue.<br>- Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA).<br>-  National Register of Citizens (NRC).<br>- BSF violence along the border.|- Illegal immigration.<br>- There is growing radicalisation of Bangladeshi Society,<br>- China in Bangladesh|

**Adverse balance of trade:**

-  The annual bilateral trade is more than $ 10 Billion, of which the exports to Bangladesh stood at $ 9 billion, while the imports from Bangladesh are at $1 billion only.
- Hence the trade relations are extraordinarily tilted in favour of India.
- The main reasons for this:
- 1. A limited number of items are in the Bangladeshi export basket.
- 2. Non-tariff barriers by India.

**Steps that were taken by India to address this:** 

- India has offered duty-free access to multiple Bangladeshi products under the**South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA).** 
- An SEZ will be notified in Bangladesh for Indian manufacturers, which when operationalized will encourage Indian manufacturers to manufacture in Bangladesh and export to India.
- India has provided a Line of Credit along with Grant- In Aid as a part of its developmental cooperation.
- However, in 8 years until 2019, only 51% of the first $800 million line of credit has been utilised.
- Barely any amount from the next two lines has been utilised.
- This has been mainly due to Red Tapism in Indian and slow program implementation in Bangladesh.

**River Water Sharing (3:08 PM):**

- Both the countries share 54 rivers, and only the Ganga water sharing agreement has been finalised in 1996 for 30 years.
- West Bengal opposes the central agreements on **Teesta.**
- Sheikh Hasina set up the **International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh****) (ICT of Bangladesh) in 2009,** which was a domestic war crimes tribunal in Bangladesh set up 2009 to investigate and prosecute suspects for the genocide committed in 1971 by the Pakistan Army and their local collaborators.
- Sheikh Hasina later won uncontested elections as BNP boycotted.
- Later for the 2014 elections, fearing anti-incumbency, she was eager to sign an agreement on Teesta to project it as an achievement in Bangladesh.
- The agreement could not be finalised, but she won comfortably.

**Ganga water Sharing Agreement 1996:**

- This was to be valid for thirty years and is applicable for the lean period of the river between 1st January till 31st May.

**Provisions of the treaty:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Availability of water**|**India's share**|**Bangladeshi share**|
|Flow exceeds 75000 cusecs|40,000 cusecs|The remaining flow|
|Flow is between 75000 and 70,000 cusecs|The remaining flow|30,000 cusecs|
|Flow is below 70,000 cusecs|50% of the flow|50% of the flow|

**Such an agreement was necessitated because:**

- To prevent a hydrological logjam between the two countries.
- It was necessitated by the commissioning of the **Farakka barrage** in 1975 to divert water from Ganga to its distributary **Hooghly**, to ensure navigability of the **Calcutta port**.
- However, Bangladesh s not happy with the treaty.
- Bangladesh claimed that its section of Ganga was drying up during the lean season due to excess withdrawal by India through the Farakka Barrage.

**Reasons for the Bangladeshi grievances:**

- Bangladesh believes that the treaty is based on outdated hydrological data and the river flow rarely crosses 75,000 cusecs.
- Studies have also shown that post this treaty, Bangladesh did not receive its guaranteed share during the critical dry periods about 65% of the time.
- In any case, the distribution of water based on volumetric allocation is a reductionist approach and it misses the **multidimensionality** of the flow **(WEBS**: Water, Ecosystem Services, Biodiversity, Sediments,).
- Such an approach jeopardizes the ecosystem services offered by the river.
- Since the political leadership in both countries is well entrenched, the treaty’s imminent expiry presents an opportunity to explore appropriate mechanisms as an improvement over the current river water sharing agreement between the two countries.

**Teesta River (3:30 PM):**

- It originates in Sikkim and flows through West Bengal before entering Bangladesh.
- Earlier it also flew through Assam, but its course got changed. It is a tributary of Brahmaputra.
![Bhutan 1ndia](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061601-2.png)

**Importance of Teesta river for Bangladesh:**

- Its flood plains cover 14% of the net sown area of Bangladesh and provide direct livelihood opportunities to about 73% of the Bangladeshi population.
- Bangladesh takes three crops per year, hence a larger gross area over the net sown area, and more water requirements.

**Importance of Teesta river for India:**

- Teesta is the lifeline of North Bengal and almost half a dozen districts depend on Teesta water.

**Previous attempts at sharing Teesta River waters :**

- **In 1983, there was an Ad-hoc agreement** finalised under the aegis of the **Joint River Commission** between India and Bangladesh under the **1972 Agreement of Peace Friendship and Cooperation**.
- Under it, India was awarded 39% of the river water flow, while Bangladesh was awarded 36%, and the remaining 25% of water was unallocated.
- This agreement was valid only for two years.

In **2011, an interim agreement** to be valid for 15 years was put forth.

- According to it, India’s share would be 42.5 %, Bangladesh’s share would be 37.5 % and 20 % of the water would flow freely into the Bay of Bengal.
- This agreement could not be finalised because of opposition by the State of West Bengal.

**The demand of Bangladesh:**

- It demands equitable sharing of Teesta’s river water.

**Stand of India:**

- Since 71% of the watershed, and 86 % of the floodplains of Teesta lie in India, Bangladesh cannot demand its equitable sharing.
- The flow of the river has decreased because of global warming as many of the glaciers on the Teesta River have retreated.
- The Chief Minister Of West Bengal succinctly commented that while she would want to share with Bangladesh the waters of Teesta, its water flow has fallen.

**Chinese angle (3:49 PM):**

- There have been reports of China and Bangladesh discussing a $1 billion loan for the complete restoration of the Teesta basin.
- The project is aimed at efficient management of the Teesta river basin, tackling water crisis, and managing droughts and floods.

**Solution:**

- In the spirit of the **Gujaral Doctrine** if feasible, India must meet the demands of Bangladesh, as it will help in addressing the “**Small Power- Big Power “syndrome,** or as **Robert Keohane** puts it- the **Lilliputian's Dilemma.** Box.
- It will also give a push to Sheikh Hasina and will help Indian soft power.
- West Bengal has proposed sharing water from other transboundary rivers like Torsa, Santosh, Manshai, Dhansai, etc.

**Rohingya issue:**

- They are believed to be of Bangladeshi origin and settled in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.
- They had been severely persecuted by the Junta regimes of Myanmar.
- They are also referred to as "Boat people", as they mainly use boats to flee to Bangladesh and Thailand.
- Around a million refugees have found shelters in Bangladesh which has created economic and security pressures for it.
- Thus, Bangladesh has insisted that India presses the issue with Myanmar to take back its citizens.
- However, India fearing that any such pressure would only push Myanmar more towards China has not undertaken such diplomatic endeavour.
- Instead, it provided food tranches as humanitarian assistance to lessen the pressure on the state of Bangladesh.

**CAA, NRC:**

- The recent policies like amending the Citizenship Act and plans to implement the NRC have stoked fears over an impending exodus of people from Assam to Bangladesh.
- Also, the religious persecution of minorities in Bangladesh implied under the act harms Bangladesh’s image internationally.

**Killings along the border:**

- In 2020, there was the highest number of border shootings by the BSF.
- They shot at civilians usually the cattle traders who are usually unarmed, trying to illegally cross the border.
- Bangladesh is concerned about the absence of due legal proceedings, and the direct resort to shooting at civilians.
- India has failed to take necessary actions in this regard.

**The topics for the next class**: **Continuation of India- Bangladesh, India- Sri Lanka, India -Bhutan**
 
# International Relations Class 13
 
**Revision of the last class (1:15 PM):**  
**Major issues with Bangladesh:**   
Illegal migration, China is Bangladesh, the growing radicalisation of the Bangladeshi society.  
**India’s Mexico problem:**

- Illegal migration into India is not unique to Bangladesh and it takes place in other South Asian neighbouring countries as well.
- However, what makes it an issue of concern for the bilateral ties is the scale at which such migration takes place.
- Mexico problem is a term used to denote the consequences of the large-scale migration from Mexico into the USA.
- According to rough estimates, some40 million Bangladeshis illegally live in India.
- Also, the fact that Bangladesh had never even acknowledged the existence of such a problem further complicates the issue.

**Causes for the migration:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Push factors**|**Pull factors**|
|- Agrarian distress<br>- Population density<br>- Poor standard of living|- Better livelihood opportunities<br>- Porous borders.<br>- Linguistic and cultural affinity to India.|

**Some other causes:**

- Corruption in border management.
- Vote bank Politics has prevented an effective deterrence.
- There have been some recent causes like the **Citizenshipship Amendment Act (CAA)(2019)** and the **National Register of Citizens (NRC),** there have been some ramifications like:
- Cancellations of some high-level visits from Bangladesh.
- Expression of discontent through the highest diplomatic channels.
- It is believed that it was good that it happened during Awami League's Sheikh Hasina's rule.
- Had it been under the reign of the BNP which has stoked anti -India sentiments in Bangladesh earlier also, things might have spilt out of proportion.

|   |
|---|
|**Bangladesh's tryst with secularism:**<br><br>- The original Bangladeshi constitution declared Bangladesh as a secular state without any state religion.<br>- In 1977, secularism was removed from the constitution by a Martial Law directive during the military dictatorship of **Ziaur Rahman.**<br>- Also, **Islam** was declared the state religion. <br>- In 1988, the Parliament of Bangladesh declared Islam as the state religion during the presidency of Hussain Muhammad Ershad.<br>-  **Sheikh Hasina** later though changed back to secular, but the clause denoting Islam as the state religion continued.|

**Consequences of such a large-scale migration:**

- Fear of **demographic inversion;** For instance, Tripura was once a tribal majority state, today it comprises around 70 % Bengali population.
- Pressure on the already limited resources.
- Despite the migrants taking the lowest level jobs, it still contributes to increasing in unemployment in India.
- Also with due time, they might rise. In the socioeconomic ladder and take up higher jobs as well.
- Most of the illegal migrants get themselves listed on the voter’s list and affect democratic functioning.
- Deterioration in law and order is seen through an increase in crime in society.
- For example, illegal migrants are prone to trafficking, since they are not protected under Indian laws.
- **Xenophobia:** It is an extreme, intense fear and dislike of customs, cultures, and people considered strange, unusual, or unknown.
- Even Indian Muslim Bengalis are sometimes targeted while being labelled as probable illegal immigrants.

**Some steps that have been taken by the Indian Government( 1:45 PM)**  
**Illegal Migration (Determination by the Tribunals )Act(IMDT) 1983:**

- It prescribed the procedures to detect and expel illegal migrants and expel them from India.
- However, the absence of any provision related to the **Burden of Proof** put a heavy burden upon the authorities to determine whether the person is an illegal migrant.
- The act was eventually struck down by the Supreme Court of India in 2005 after a case filed by **Sarbananda Sonowal.**

**Foreigners Act (1946):**

- The burden of proof lay with the person and not with the authorities.
- It was amended in 2019 which empowered even district magistrates to set up tribunals to decide whether a person is an illegal immigrant.

**Infrastructural steps:**

- The Indian government had resorted to electric wiring of the India- Bangladesh border.
- According to international conventions, such borders should have no man’s land.
- However, since the India- Bangladesh border is densely populated, people live close by such electric fences, resulting in a humanitarian crisis with often women, children and even cattle succumbing to the electric shocks.
- They are also violative of international norms.
- It is an Israeli solution to illegal immigration.

**National Register of Citizens( NRC) :**

- Recently, the Indian Government undertook the exercise of registering Indian citizens under NRC to help identify illegal immigrants.
- But it has resulted in the targeting of Indian Bengali Muslims in the state.
- Also, when the issue of whether the Indian government plans to transfer the illegal migrants to Bangladesh was raised by the Sheikh Hasina government, PM Modi assuaged her concerns that the NRC is an internal matter, and would be tackled within India and Bangladesh should not fear any impending exodus from India.
- However domestically it raises questions about the utility of such an exercise.

**Possible solutions to the issue:**

- Checking corruption in the Border management agencies.
- Proper manning of the porous borders through intensive patrolling and technological aids like drones, etc.
- Issue work permits to the migrants so that we can regulate and track such migrants.
- Given that the push ad the pull factors on either side are quite strong, illegal immigration cannot be stopped.
- Thus, the government should regulate the number and quality of Bangladeshi immigrants.
- It will not only curb th associated problems of illegal immigration but will substantially augment the soft power of the country.
- India by providing necessary development assistance such as infrastructure development, aiding economic diversification and resilience of Bangladesh, India can reduce the intensity of the push factors, consequently, checking the number of illegal immigrants entering India. 
**China in Bangladesh(2:20 PM):**  
**Reasons for Chinese interest in Bangladesh:**

- China wants to project itself as a global power and interference in India's backyard would project China much stronger.
- It is a part of the **String of Pearls,** policy through which it seeks to establish infrastructural projects in different nations so as to encircle India.
- Access to the Bay of Bengal would increase the optional routes for sea trade and most importantly will assuage China's **Malacca dilemma.**

**Why does China enjoy bipartisan consensus that  in Bangladesh?:**

- China is a very important factor in Bangladesh's **Look East Policy**.
- Bangladesh seeks diversification of its trade and other opportunities which till now see a prominent role for India.
- Recently, China has further made inroads due to the bitterness in India-Bangladesh bilateral relations caused by CAA NRC.

**Pieces of Evidence of increasing Chinese footprint in Bangladesh:**

- Bangladesh joined the **Belt & Road Initiative (BRI).** 
- 97% of Bangladeshi goods get duty-free access.
- China has extended multiple Lines of Credit and has entered into many agreements with Bangladesh related to infrastructure and sister cities.
- China provided Covid aid to Bangladesh and promised assistance after china develops its own vaccine.
- China is the largest weapons exporter to Bangladesh and also supplies critical defence pieces of equipment like submarines.
- China is the only country with which Bangladesh has a Defence Cooperation Agreement.

**Options before India:**

- India must work for the timely completion of infrastructure projects.
- Ways must be devised to pacify the acrimony after CAA, and NRC.
- It is said that for good bilateral relations, "India must forget history and Bangladesh must forget Geography".￼Sheikh Hasina said that "despite the economic partnership with China, the relationship with India will remain special".

**Growing radicalisation in the Bangladeshi society:**

- There has been growing radicalisation in the Bangladeshi society and India is concerned that the communal propaganda of the radical groups like Jamaat-E-Islami, Huji, Huji B, etc could spill across the border and result in the radicalisation of the Indian youth.

**Drivers of India-Bangladesh relations:**

- **Long porous borders-** India shares the largest land boundary with Bangladesh which is **4,096 kilometres** long, which is the fifth-longest land border in the world.
- India and Bangladesh share history and culture running back centuries.
- Incidences in one country have ramifications across the borders.￼Therefore the way ahead in India- Bangladesh relations lie in cooperation and not in conflict.

**New areas of Cooperation:**  
**Cyberspace**:

- Bangladesh has provided cyber connectivity between the international gateway at Cox’s Bazaar to Agartala.
- It would lead to faster internet connectivity in the North Eastern states.
- However, the project cost will be borne by India.

**Regional organisations in South Asia (2:45 PM):**  
**Practice questions:**  
Q 1. SAARC is in dead-end waters and the rest of the regions have moved on to other avenues for cooperation. Give reasons for its failures and give suggestions for the way forward.  
Q 2 Has the Government of India moved away from BIMSTEC? Also, examine whether SAARC has lost relevance to BIMSTEC in the recent years  
**SAARC :**

- It stands for South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
- It was formed in 1985.
- Zia UR Rahman had conceptualised the idea of SAARC to give bargaining power to South Asian countries against India.
- India had joined later; Pakistan earlier believed that the group would be bogged down by Indian hegemony but later believed that it can better hamper Indian regional initiatives by being a member.
- It had7 founding members countries-India, Bangladesh, Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.
- Afghanistan joined in 2008
- **Observers of SAARC are** Australia, China, the European Union, Iran, Japan, Mauritius, Myanmar, South Korea, and the United States.
- SAARC is based on the principles of **Panchsheel**

|   |
|---|
|**Panchsheel:**  <br>They are the five principles of peaceful coexistence to govern relations between states. They include:<br><br>- Mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.<br>- Mutual non-aggression.<br>- Non-interference in each other's internal affairs,<br>- Equality and mutual benefit.<br>- Peaceful co-existence.|

|   |
|---|
|**Post-Colonialism:**<br><br>- Postcolonialism is the critical academic study of the cultural, political and economic legacy of colonialism and imperialism, focusing on the impact of human control and exploitation of colonized people and their lands.<br>- Post-colonial societies are believed to be those societies when even after gaining independence, the feeling of subservience to earlier colonial states.<br>- The subservience can be seen in different ways- cultural tastes, professional and lifestyle preferences, etc.<br>- The social status given to the English language in India is believed as an example of Post -Colonialism.<br>- Nations like Australia, Canada, etc are not considered post-colonial states despite having colonial history because of their outlook towards their colonial past, current preferences and the future.|

**Achievements of SAARC(3:30 PM):**  
Some notable achievements have been the :

- South Asian University New Delhi.
- SAARC covid emergency funds.
- SAARC Disaater Management Centre Gandhinagar.
- SAARC satellite.
- SAARC Milk Grid.
- SAARC Food Van.
- SAARC Free Trade Agreement.

But such achievements have been too far and too few.  
**Failures of SAARC:**

- SAARC has held irregular summits- the 2016 summit in Pakistan was cancelled after India announced to boycott it after the terrorist attacks at Uri and many other nations like Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka followed in boycotting the summit
- The internal trade of SAARC is only around 5 % of their total external trade. In comparison, the internal trade, as a percentage of their total trade is 65 % for the EU and  25% for ASEAN.
- The intra-regional investment treaty for SAARC is in abeyance for a long time.

**Reasons for failure of SAARC:**  
**Insecurity:**

- There exists a large size asymmetry between India and all the other member nations.
- India has a hard time convincing the other members that any step that it takes in the neighbourhood does not have any ulterior motive.
- It is remarked that "India is the 298-pound gorilla and its any move is looked at suspicion by other 98-pound gorillas.
- Regardless of the motive and practicalities involved, steps like the 1971 partition of Pakistan, the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka, and the Sikkim Annexation have been portrayed as actions driven by imperialist motives.

**India-Pakistan rivalry:**

- The rivalry and distrust between the two largest members of SAARC is been regarded as the biggest obstacle before SAARC.
- For example, the **Motor Vehicle Agreement (MVA)** was envisaged at the SAARC level, later due to Pakistan, it had to be deliberated at the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal **(BBIN)** level.
- **C Rajamohan** believes that "The Caravan of South Asia is being slowed down by Pakistan".

**Role of external powers:**

- USA wanted the EU and ASEAN to succeed against communism spread.
- Pakistan had joined CENTO and SEATO, and India tilted towards USSR despite being Non- Aligned.
- Hence, USA‘s role in SAARC and the region was overall divisive

South Asia faces **reverse regionalism/reductive regionalism :**

- They are interested in asserting their distinctness from India.
- South Asian countries like India, Nepal, Bangladesh, etc have very high levels of cultural similarities and commonalities, yet the sense of patriotism in these nations is understood in the sense of their expression of anti-India sentiments.
- There exist supplementary industries in the countries, and hence the industries compete with each other, rather than complementing each other through manufacturing goods and services at different levels of the supply-manufacturing chain.
- For example- both India and Bangladesh are major producers of Jute products.

**Resource crunch:**

- South Asian countries are not very resources rich.
- South Asia has very high levels of poverty and malnutrition as compared to regions such as Europe or North America.

**Sub-regionalism:**

- Many members have already started chalking out intra-SAARC agreements to continue functions despite the SAARC logjam. For example BBIN, South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), etc.

**Steps that can be taken for the rejuvenation of SAARC:**

- Any agreement with SAARC- after excluding Pakistan won't be feasible.
- SAARC minus Pakistan arrangement would also see connectivity issues for Afghanistan.
- India and Pakistan must keep their differences and insecurities aside to at least achieve cooperation in certain low-lying sectors like Medical Tourism, Sports development, etc.
- The demand for Chinese membership in SAARC has been raised many times by both Pakistan and Nepal. India can look for a suitable arrangement with China through cooperation and compromise in other sectors. 
**BIMSTEC (3:55 PM):**

- It was formed as **BIST-EC** in 1997: Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka Thailand Economic Cooperation.
- Its Secretariat is in **Dhaka**.
- It became BIMSTEC when Myanmar joined later in 1997.
- The aim was to avoid disturbance by Pak and include the growing economy of Thailand.
- In 2004, Nepal and Bhutan joined and the organisation was named as Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation.

**Importance of BIMSTEC:**

- It represents 21% of the world’s population and nearly $3 trillion in GDP.
- It is very vital for the development of North Eastern states and connectivity to South East Asia and it can act as a bridge between South Asia and South East Asia.
- It can help in countering the Chinese presence in South East Asia.
- BIMSTEC comprises emerging economies which despite the global slowdown of 2008-12, continued to grow with an average GDP growth rate of 6.5 %.The 
- The Bay of Bengal is rich in untapped economic resources such as reserves of gas, seabed minerals, oil, fishing stock, etc.

**Challenges faced by BIMSTEC:**

- BIMSTEC has two types of summits – ministerial and head of the state level.
- The Head of State summits have been very irregular- only 5 meetings have been held in 25 years; the last was in 2022 in Lanka.
- It has seen a lack of leadership in both India and Thailand. 
- The Secretariat faces a lack of finances and manpower.
- India in the latest summit announced that it will provide $1 million to the BIMSTEC secretariat to increase its operational budget.
- BIMSTEC FTA is in negotiation since 2004.
- Domestic issues of members- political instability in Thailand, Military Coup in Myanmar, etc affect the necessary political will of the member countries towards BIMSTEC

**Recent Steps to expand the scope of BIMSTEC:**

- A joint military exercise was planned but  Nepal and Thailand refused.

**Achievement:**

- They had adopted the BIMSTEC charter during the fifth BIMSTEC summit.

**The topics for the next class:** Mekong Ganga, Indian Ocean Regional Association, Indian Ocean Naval Symposium, etc.
 
# International Relations Class 14
 
**Revision of the previous class (1:15 PM):**

- Background of BIMSTEC, a brief coverage of the last virtual BIMSTEC summit held in Sri Lanka.

**Question:** Can BIMSTEC be a replacement for SAARC?  
The answer can be on the given lines:

- We can start with a brief description of both the bodies.

**Main body:**

- Evidence of the shift of prominence from SAARC to BIMSTEC
- Shortcomings/Effects of the Shift

**Scope:** Has SAARC lost its relevance/ Do they have overlapping mandates?

|   |
|---|
|**Scope v/s Potential:**<br><br>- **Scope** talks about the mandate. For ex- 5thBIMSTEC meet gave 7 pillars of cooperation.<br>- **Potential**- The inherent opportunities that are yet to be realized.|

**Pieces of evidence of the shift:**

- The indefinite postponement of the summit.
- During the first term swearing-in ceremony of the present government in 2014, SAARC leaders were invited and for the second swearing-in ceremony in 2019, BIMSTEC leaders were invited.
- As a part of the BRICS Outreach Summit in Goa in 2016, BIMSTEC leaders were invited.

**Reasons for the shift:**

- Failures of SAARC-Irregular summits, no concrete achievements, intra-SAARC trade still very low.

**Is SAARC irrelevant?**

- Important global powers are present as observer members- Australia, China, the European Union, Iran,  Japan, South Korea, United States of America, etc

**Even BIMSTEC is not free from challenges as:**

- Even BIMSTEC sees irregular summits and has not finalized an FTA.
- BIMSTEC founding principles include **Panchsheel ideals** and the declaration that the cooperation within it will act as an addition to, but not as a substitution to the existing bilateral and multilateral agreements.
-   
    

|   |
|---|
|- The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, known in India as the **Panchsheel Treaty** are a set of principles to govern relations between states.<br>- Mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.<br>- Mutual non-aggression.<br>- Mutual non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.<br>- Equality and cooperation for mutual benefit.<br>- Peaceful co-existence.|

**Mekong- Ganga Cooperation(MGC) (1:45 PM):**

- It was founded in 2000 in **Vientiane, Laos** through the **Vientiane declaration.**
- India and Thailand were the main proponents.
- The original aim was the development of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the region- CLMV ( Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam).
- Ganga and Mekong are considered civilizational rivers- great rivers whose banks major civilizations flourished. 
- The aim of MGC is to facilitate closer contact among the people inhabiting these two civilizational rivers.
- 11  ministerial meetings have taken place with the last one being in 2021 in Cambodia.
- The MGC meetings are co-chaired alternatively every year between India, and the other five Mekong countries.

**Areas of cooperation (Scope):**

- Tourism.
- Culture.
- Education.
- Transport & Communication

During the 10th MGC held in 2019 in Bangkok Thailand, three new areas of cooperation were added-

- Science & Technology.
- Water Resources Management.
- Skill Development and Capacity Building. 
**Indian Ocean Region (2:05 PM):**  
**Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA):**

- It was established in 1997 and is a regional forum that seeks to build and expand understanding and mutually beneficial cooperation through a consensus-based, evolutionary and non-intrusive approach.
- Its Secretariat is based in Ebène, Mauritius.
- Two littoral states are not members- Pakistan and Myanmar.

**Importance of the Indian Ocean region:**  
**Geo-Economic:**

- It is home to 40% of the world’s offshore hydrocarbon.
- The region has very significant fisheries stock.
- The beach sand comprises heavy minerals and placer deposits.
- Indian ocean littoral countries are expected to emerge as the leading source of growth in the coming twenty years.
- It comprises important Sea-Lines of Communications (SLOCs) through which two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments and more than 50% of the world trade take place.
- Presence of international choke-points- Hormuz Strait, Suez canal, Bab el Mandeb, Malacca strait.

**The growing importance of the Indian Ocean region for India:**

- The geopolitical importance of the ocean was always recognized by India.
- Even British India emphasized India’s dominance over the Indian Ocean region since it believed “Those who control the Indian Ocean, will control/lead Asia”.
- Post-independence, because of export pessimism(not going for export-led GDP growth ) and pre-dominance of land-based threats from Pakistan and China, India retracted from its earlier active role in the Indian Ocean.
- However, even during the time, India was the tacit security provider to the island states such as Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar, etc

|   |
|---|
|**Operation Cactus:**<br><br>- It saw the Indian Armed Forces thwart a coup in the islands of the Maldives against the elected government headed by the then President **Maumoon Abdul Gayoom**.<br>- In 1988 Abdullah Luthufi assisted by a Tamil separatist organization from Sri Lanka, the People’s Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam**(PLOTE)** had orchestrated a coup to overthrow the elected government of Maldives.|

- With the opening of the Indian economy(more than 50% contribution of international trade to Indian GDP), China’s rising economic and military engagement with the Indian ocean states, and the general shift of the theatre of international politics from the Atlantic to Indo-Pacific, once again Indian Ocean region has come to dominate Indian foreign policy.

**India’s foreign policy goals vis-à-vis Indian oceans (2:30 PM):**

- Strengthening and deepening India’s relation with Indian Ocean littoral countries.
- Establishment of India’s potential and role as the net security provider of the region.
- Establishment of rule-based stable maritime order.
- New Delhi has underlined its vision for the Indian Ocean region as **SAGAR ( Security and Growth for All in the Region).**

**Challenges for IORA:**

- The presence of China in the Indian Ocean region- China has much deeper pockets.
- Countries are at very different stages of development-Somalia, Laos, and Malaysia.
- The region is prone to non-conventional security threats like piracy.

|   |
|---|
|**Conventional** security threats- Whenever the source of the problem is a sovereign country.|

- No country is present in the region with deep pockets like USA or China is present.

|   |
|---|
|**Rise of China:**<br><br>- China is present in one-tenths of European ports.<br>- According to estimates by World Bank, China's GDP was approx 11% of the US in 1960, but in 2019 it is 67%.<br>- In the terms of Purchasing Power Parity, Chinese GDP has exceeded that of the USA.<br>- But the Chinese have an extreme lack of soft power|

|   |
|---|
|**Socialism & Communism:**<br><br>- Communism is a utopia, except for a brief experiment of the **Paris Commune** (18thMarch- 28th May 1871).<br>- **Communism** believes that everyone would be given according to their need.<br>- **Socialism** believes that everyone would be given according to their contribution.<br>- **Capitalism** is accused to create a system that sees capitalists getting more and laborers getting less.<br>- Public ownership could not encourage competitiveness and hence innovation is everyone’s responsibility is no one’s responsibility.|

   
**India- Central Asia relations (3:10 PM):**  
**Importance of Central Asia:**

- Its location is such that **Great Games** between great powers have been fought on its soil.
- Presently it is an arena of “great game” played out between Russia, China, the USA, Turkey, Iran, Europe, Pakistan, and India.
- They act as a gateway to Europe, East Asia, and West Asia.

**Economic importance:**

- **Kazakhstan** is the predominant power in the region and holds the world’s second largest natural reserves of Uranium.
- **Uzbekistan**- Reserves of Uranium and Natural Gas.
- **Turkmenistan**- It has the fourth largest natural gas reserves.
- **Tajikistan-** Huge hydropower potential.
- **Kyrgystan-** Gold and hydropower potential

**Security:**

- The region potentially acts as a buffer to contain the fallout of fundamentalism. 
- To insulate India from **narco-terrorism** and to forestall India’s encirclement by any regional or outside power.
- Narco-Terrorism simply means the arrangement where the proceeds from the illegal narcotics trade are used to fuel terrorism.
- The region’s importance has been accentuated after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, and the threat of the spread of narco-terrorism.
- The three central Asian republics sharing borders with Afghanistan- Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, agree with India on the need to have an inclusive government, unhindered humanitarian trade, and preservation of rights of women, children, and minorities in Afghanistan.
- In a veiled reference to Pakistan, **T****hird India- Central Asia Dialogue Mechanism**references “No-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and respect for its sovereignty as mentioned in UNSC resolution 2593 in  2021. 
-   
    

|   |
|---|
|**United Nations Security Council Resolution 2593:**<br><br>- It was adopted on August 30, 2021, following the fall of Kabul and the subsequent Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.<br>- According to the resolution, the Security Council demands that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any other country or to shelter and train terrorists.|

- They also emphasized the early adoption of the **UN-Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT)**.
- Significantly, the foreign ministers of the five republics skipped the **Organisation of Islamic Cooperation** meeting in Islamabad to attend the dialogue in India.
- Also, all the five countries attended the NSA-level meeting on Afghanistan that India hosted in November 2021.
- The strategic importance remains to balance China in the region.

**Why is India important to Central Asia ?:**

- To seek cooperation vis–a–vis Afghanistan, since we intend similar outcomes and share a common vision with respect to peace and security in Afghanistan.
- Inda is seen as a non-threatening power.
- To gain greater strategic maneuverability vis-a-vis traditional powers in the region- Russia and now China.
- They seek to learn from India how to insulate their youth from radicalism; Considering the population and the fact that radicalized lone-wolf attacks have reached the USA, Europe, and even Scandinavian countries, India has been remarkable in curbing radical Islam. 

**Evolution of Indian relationship with Central Asia (3:45 PM):**  
**Historical relations:**

- India and Central Asia share significant cultural civilizational and historical linkages.
- Central Asia was located on the Silk Route.
- The Silk route in addition to goods served as an effective channel for thoughts, religion, and philosophy.
- Buddhism spread through this route from India to Central Asia, while Sufism spread from the region to India. Babur came from the **Ferghana valley** in Central Asia.

**Soviet period:**

- India shared close ties through music, movies, dance, and literature.

**Following their independence in 1991**, India was expected to have close relations with the republics, but India at that time was faced with twin challenges of adjusting to the emerging Post-Cold war order and domestic security& economic reforms.

- However, to strengthen our relations with the region, India launched the “ **Look North Policy**” in 1995, but it was a non-starter.
- Central Asian republics also faced political volatility in the early years such as the civil war in Tajikistan.
- It is only two decades later that India once again launched the “Connect Central Asia” policy in 2012 which emphasized building political, economic, security, and cultural connections.
- However, a major push to the bilateral relations came with PM Modi’s visit to all five Central Asian republics in 2015.
- Since then, our relations have come a long way.
- In 2019, the India- Central Asia Dialogue mechanism was established under which three dialogues have taken place.
- The third dialogue emphasized the **four C’s- Commerce, Capacity Development, Connectivity, and Contacts.**
- Recently in **January 2022,** the first India-Central Asia summit was hosted by India in a virtual format.
- It has led to the institutionalization of the relations.
- In a historic decision, they decided to hold the summit every two years, along with regular meetings of foreign ministers, and trade and culture ministers to prepare for the summit meetings.
- India-Central Asia secretariat would be set up in New Delhi.

**The topics for the next class:** Scope of India- Central Asia relations, Challenges in India- Central Asia relations, India- Sri Lanka relations.
 
# International Relations Class 15
 
**Issues in India- Central Asia relations (1:20 PM):**  
**Bilateral trade:**

- The bilateral trade between India and the Central Asian Republics (CARs) has stood at around **$ 2 billion** annually; it was around $1.4 billion last year. 
- The main reason is the lack of land connectivity.
- The shortest route to Central Asia passes through hostile Pakistan and unstable Afghanistan.
- Therefore at present, India’s trade with the region is conducted through China.
- India’s failure to develop infrastructure projects abroad to foster regional connectivity.
- Connectivity projects such as the INSTC corridor, TAPI pipeline, and Central Asia- South Asia Electricity project are yet not completed.

**Central Asia Republics and China:** 

![KAZAKHSTAN llZBEKlSTAN TllRKMENlSTAN KYRGYZSTAN TA...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061603-3.png)- China is one of the leading trade partners of the region with annual trade with the region standing at around $ 40 billion.
- With the launch of the BRI initiative, China has emerged as the biggest investor in the region surpassing Russia.
- Presently 20% of china's energy is sourced from CAR.
- Three of the five CARs share their border with China- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.
- The pursuit of close relations by India with China’s immediate neighborhood prompted China to host a virtual meeting with the leaders of the five CARs.
- In 2020, **C+ C 5** foreign ministers meeting mechanism was established.
- In the recent summit, they announced the building of **China- Central Asia community with a shared future.** 
- Chinese foreign minister commented that China and Central Asia are closely interdependent like **“Lips and Teeth”** (China uses the same euphemism for China- Nepal relations)  and share "weal and woe".
- They set $70 billion as the target for bilateral trade by 2030.

|**China-Russia relations:**<br><br>- China and Russia had believed to have structural issues bound to create differences between them.<br>- Apart from border disputes which got culminated in armed conflict in 1969, they had also seen competition for leadership of the communist world.<br>- But the Western sanctions are believed to have pushed them closer.<br>- This can be problematic for India as India has had good and multidimensional relations with Russia.|

- China’s close trade and political ties with CARs sit uncomfortably with Indian policymakers.
- China’s presence in the Indian Ocean and South Asia when combined with its growing presence in Central Asia compounds India’s concerns of potential Chinese encirclement.

**However, the Chinese relationship with CARs is not free of trouble:**

-  The region is concerned with an inverse balance of trade as China- CAR trade in tilted in the favour of China, just like with most trade partners of China..
- China is believed to practice a modern version of **Mercantilism.**
-   
    

|   |
|---|
|**Mercantilism:**<br><br>- Mercantilism is an economic practice by which governments used their economies to augment state power at the expense of other countries.<br>- Under this, the governments sought to ensure that exports exceeded imports and to accumulate wealth in the form of bullion (mostly gold and silver).<br>- **Chinese mercantilist policies** include currency manipulation, enforcing domestic technology standards, complicated regulatory certification requirements, and discriminatory government procurement activities.|

- The growing Chinese presence has raised concerns over the possible land takeover.
- The ecological degradation by the Chinese firms and the persecution of ethnic Kyrgyz in China’s  Xinjiang province are some other irritants.

|Prior to World War 2, the **Capitalist** nations like the USA, United Kingdom, France, etc felt alarmed by the increasing sphere of influence of **Communism**. They originally sought to utilize **Fascism** and **Nazism** against Communism. Eventually, the capitalist camp and the communist camp had to combine efforts|

**Steps that were taken by the Government of India to increase engagement in CARs (2:06 PM):**

- First India- Central Asia Summit was organized in January 2022 and through it, India had sought to institutionalize its relations with the region.
- India became a full member of the **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)**in 2017.
- They have identified key areas of strategic engagement towards enhancing defense and security ties, economic and connectivity initiatives, and energy cooperation, particularly in the context of issues related to India’s $ 1 billion Line of Credit for projects in Central Asia.
- India has supported multiple options of connectivity in the region including the **Ashgabat Agreement** on international transport and transit corridor.

**Ashgabat Agreement:**

- In April 2011, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Turkmenistan (Capital Ashgabat), the Sultanate of Oman, and the Republic of Uzbekistan signed the Ashgabat Agreement to create a joint transportation and transit corridor.
- The agreement created a network of transport routes across Central Asia to connect this region to the Persian Gulf. 
![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061605-4.jpeg)- Qatar withdrew in 2013.
- It entered into force in 2016.
- Kazakhstan and Pakistan joined in 2016 and in  2018 India joined.

**Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

- It has a permanent headquarter in Beijing.
- It was started in 1996 as **Shanghai Five** at Shanghai, due to its membership of five countries- China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan( the three CARs that share a border with China).
- The main aim was to establish peace at Chinese eastern borders, and the Ughyr insurgency.
- After Uzbekistan joined in 2001, it was called SCO.
- In 2017, both India and Pakistan joined as full-time members.
- Turkmenistan follows a neutral foreign policy and hence is not a member of SCO.
- Iran is the latest member to join as a full member in 2021.
- Observer states of SCO- Afghanistan, Belarus, Mongolia.
- It comprises two permanent bodies: The **Permanent Secretariat** at Beijing and the **Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS).**
- RATS is headquartered in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and is believed as the major reason behind India being interested in SCO.
- The aim of the organization is to tackle the triple evils- Extremism, Terrorism, and Separatism.
- The working of SCO is underpinned by the **Shanghai Spirit** which is about mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, respect for cultural diversity, the pursuit of common development, and non-alignment.
- SCO is looked upon by the west as a counter to **NATO** in the region.
- It is seen as an anti-West organization like **BRICS.** 
- In fact, India’s membership in SCO was criticized by the west as India joining an anti-west organization.
- However, India justified its membership citing the component of Non-Alignment in the Shanghai spirit.
- Russian and Mandarin are used as the official working languages in the SCO.

**Working Structure of SCO (2:37 PM):**

- Heads of States Council is the highest decision-making body in SCO.
- Heads of Government council is the second highest body.

**The global influence of SCO:**

- SCO represents around 42% of the world’s population and 20% of the global GDP.
- Four of its member countries are nuclear powers( Russia, China, India, and Pakistan).
- Two countries are permanent members of the UNSC (Russia and China).

**Importance of SCO for India:**

- India believes it can better secure itself against cross-border terrorism by leveraging SCO institutions.
- SCO can provide India a very good channel to effectively utilize its potential in CAR in Security, Trade, Energy, etc.

**Challenges for India in SCO:**

- SCO is dominated by China; closely followed by Russia.
- India will have to accept the role of second fiddle in the organization, with which India is generally uncomfortable.
- **Russia- China-Pakistan axis**- The growing closeness between Russia and China further aggravates India's concerns with the already existing China-Pakistan axis.
- Cooperation vis–a–vis terrorism could be ineffective.SCO defines terrorism as **“homegrown groups targeting political regimes** in the country, while India defines it as” **cross-border sponsored”.**
- Also, India’s terrorist organizations of concern are Lashkar E Taiba, Jaish E Mohammad, Haqqani network, etc while RATS does not gather information vis-s –vis them and targets terrorist organizations such as **East Turkestan Islamic Movement( ETIM),** etc operating in Central Asia.
- Except for India, all other SCO countries have endorsed BRI, which may create pressure on India to follow.
- **Lack of connectivity** – Pakistan’s strategic denial of overland connectivity to Afghanistan and beyond is a major impediment to the relations

**Challenges for SCO:**

- **India- Pakistan rivalry** may impact the smooth functioning of SCO since the decisions in SCO are taken by consensus.
- Leadership issues between Russia and China; even Russia is wary of increased Chinese presence in CARs which Russia considers its backyard.￼Other organizations in the region such as **Eurasian Economic Union ( EAEU)** (Founding members- Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan had formed a customs union, and the **Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) (**Founding members- Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan).

|**Stages of Economic Integration:**<br><br>![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061609-5.png)- A **Preferential Trade Agreement** is formed on the basis of a **positive list-** Member countries specify the sectors for which liberalization is implemented.<br>- A **Free Trade Agreement** is formed on the basis of a **negative list-** Member countries specify the sectors which are exempted from the obligation of liberalization.<br>- **Customs Union-** It will see zero tariff rates among members and a common tariff with the rest of the world. It was earlier thought for SAFTA too.<br>- **Monetary/ Fiscal/ Economic Union-** It will see the members following the same fiscal/monetary policy as specified.<br>- **Political Union-** The members will merge into one single unit.|

**Options before India (3:09 PM):**

- Boost connectivity with the region.
- Constructively engage with Pakistan.
- India should mobilize opinion in SCO to constructively pressurize Pakistan to allow over-land connectivity to Afghanistan and Central Asia.
- India should leverage its soft power to enhance its spheres of engagement in areas such as culture, cuisine, education, etc.
- India could aid in the de-radicalization of youths in Central Asia

![SURINAME ECUADOR VENEZUELA by Getty 11 COLOMBIA EC...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061621-11.jpeg)

**Importance of Latin America & Caribbean(LAC) for India:**  
**Trade and investment:**

- India has a Preferential Trade Agreement with Chile and Mercursor.
- An FTA is being negotiated with Peru.
- Indian companies have invested in greenfield and brownfield projects in LAC.

**Energy security:** 

- Latin America accounts for 15% of India’s crude oil imports mainly from Mexico and Venezuela. Such imports are important because:
- It allows India to lessen its dependence on oil from politically unstable West Asia and the OPEC countries which operate as a cartel and charge **Asian Premium.****￼****Climate change:**
- Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina hold most of the lithium reserves in the world and are referred to as **Lithium Triangle.**
- With India’s plans to roll out electric vehicles, it would require lithium supplies that are used in the batteries of such vehicles, and India does not have substantial lithium reserves.
- Several LAC countries are members of the India-led **International Solar Alliance.**

**Food security:**

- Latin America is five times the size of India with only half as much population.
- It has large tracts of fertile lands which can be cultivated for India’s food security.
- Indian private entities are leasing land there and cultivating it.

**Geo-Political importance:**

- It comprises more than 33 countries, and hence their support is essential to help India achieve its global ambitions such as permanent membership in UNSC.
- Also, LAC and India share common goals vis-à-vis climate change, global trade, as well as terrorism.
- Thus, they can aid each other in global negotiations at global platforms like WTO, UNFCC, etc

**The topic for the next class:** Continuation of India- Latin America relations.
 
# International Relations Class 16
 
**Evolution of India's relations with Latin America (5:10:04 PM)**

- Until recently LAC was considered a 'forgotten continent' in India's foreign policy.
- This region has remained in the backwaters of Indian diplomacy
- It suffers from 'out of sight, out of mind syndrome

**Evolution of Relations (5:30:07 PM)**

- **During the cold war ear**-
- Indian and LAC share a colonial past 
- Adopted socialist policies after their independence 
- Have faced similar economic issues forcing them to open their economies to the outside world
- Post their economic liberalization both are seen as potential economic powerhouses with immense potential for investment signaling their simultaneous economic rise
- Despite such similarities, during the cold war era as well as post-India and LAC have failed to undertake significant political and development cooperation
- During the cold war era, despite their similarity in being newly independent countries facing underdevelopment, they were not each other's foreign policy priorities
- India was the inward-looking economy
- India's energy demands were met in west Asia
- The Latin American countries were suffering from political instability and the economy was not attractive
- Though India and LAC were engaged in NAM, G17, and UN General Assembly under the aegis of south-south cooperation, this could not create conditions for deeper economic engagement between the two
- During this time there were only two high-level visits from India to the region- Nehru’s visit to Mexico in 1961 and Indira Gandhi’s visit to 8 countries of the region in 1968 which she referred to as “The Voyage of Discovery”
- **Post-cold war-**
- India’s foreign policy was transfixed in its neighborhood – immediate and extended, LAC was not a foreign policy focus area for India, Unlike China which started registering a strong footprint in the region
- It is to be noted that the credit for drawing the Indian government's focus toward LAC goes to India’s private sector
- Thus, unlike the usual phenomenon of trade following a flag, the Indian LAC case Flag has followed the trade
- However, in recent years, there is increasing salience given to India in Latin America-
- a)In 2011, the Inter-American development bank published a report titled - "India: Latin America's Next Big Thing"
- CEALAC-The first pan America Latin organization held its first outreach summit in New Delhi in 2012
- b)In 2016 a report by UN Economic Commission for LAC suggested that LAC countries could enhance their trade and economic relations with India by undertaking structural adjustments in their economies
- c)It identifies India, Latin America, and China as the world's new growth poles
- d)Apart from economic potential India's strong presence in the region would provide it an opportunity to diversify from its traditional hegemon USA and gain maneuverability with China which many views as pushing LAC into the corner of the raw material apart from turning it into a dumping ground of chief consumer goods
- Despite the realization of potential in relations, bilateral engagement is a laggard

**Growing Chinese presence in the region (6:00:01 PM)**

- It has risen exponentially in the region given the past few years
- China has become South America
- China’s annual trade with the region is $ 250-300 bn and for India, it is $30-50 bn (a huge gap)
- It is Latin America’s most important lender –more than WB, Inter America development bank combined
- It is among the chief foreign investors in LAC
- China has a target of 500 bn US dollars in trade and 250 bn dollars in investment in the region by 2025 which would establish it as the dominant economic power in the region
- Massive infrastructure projects such as a bi-oceanic railway connecting the ports- of Santos in Brazil and Callao, Peru
- Has planned to construct Canal in Nicaragua
- In the political and diplomatic arena-
- In the last 15 years, Beijing has managed to get 5 Latin American countries-Costa-Rica, El-Salvador, Nicaragua, and Panama to  switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China
- 3 Latin American countries that currently face US Sanctions-Cuban, Venezuela, and Nicaragua- have been supported by China with loans, military support, and investment
- China has for the last two decades through policy papers and appointment for the invoice, identified key areas of cooperation, and have had a congruent LAC policy

**China and India: Comparison in LAC(6:18:40 PM)**

- Though china’s presence in LAC is far ahead than India, India remains an important partner for the region-
- Though China receives far more political and diplomatic attention in the region India's benevolent presence has garnered much goodwill in Latin America
- Its IT sector, pharmaceutical, and automobile maintain an edge over China in the regions
- Unlike China, India is a democracy and it faces similar challenges compared to Latin America as well such as coalition governments, a rigid bureaucracy, Political corruption, and a frequent protest
- India’s economic growth has caught the attention of Latin American countries who have recalibrated India into their foreign policy priority as a key player in Asia

**Why LAC is important to China (6:28:47 PM)**

- To challenge USA's heegemny
- energy security
- food security
- mineral reserve
- trade and investment

**India v/s China's Approach (6:30:15 PM)**

- Unlike China, Indian companies have provided employment and training, and skill development to the locals
- like in the case of Africa there is general resentment in public against China in LAC
- **Challenges that India faces in LAC-**
- Distance and logistic impediments
- Lack of high-level political engagement-PM Modi visited Brazil for the BRICS summit in 2014; Argentina for the G20 summit in 2018
- Only 1 standalone visit has been taken by PM that is Mexico in 2016
- In fact, he became the first Indian PM to miss a NAM Summit-
- Two consecutive summits have been missed 
- Weak diplomatic presence - in the region comprising 33 countries India has only 15 embassies unlike China which is diplomatically present in all these countries 
- India 2010 had proposed to open 3 new embassies in LAC but nothing has happened on the ground
- India LAC relations do not garner sufficient media attention
- The high-level visits from LAC to India are largely ignored by the media

**What should India do (6:48:01PM)**

- Check impediments to logistics-GOI needs to give certain incentives to  the shipping companies to reduce the cost of transportation of goods
- Even at present, there exists no direct flight from Indian cities to that Latin America
- Increase political engagement with regions
- Engagee diplomatic presence in India
- At present, there are 8 centers of Latin American studies in India compared to  65 in China
- More such centers should be set up to promote the Latin American language and culture
- Need to come out with a white paper on Latin America indicating a clear foreign policy to priorities in the region
- Need to institutionalize the relations at pan LAC level as done in the case of African and Central Asia
- Use culture as a tool to strengthen India’s soft power and relations with the regions

Break (7:04:34 PM-7:11:17 PM)  
**Conclusion of India-LAC relations (7:12:03 PM)**

- India's rising eminence on the global stage has not yet found an expression in Latin America
- It is in India's interest to engage its profile in the region which while geographically remote offers a range of possibilities 
- India needs to break away from its psychological barrier which prevents effective engagement with the region 
- The present uncertain times for LAC as capital flows decline as pandemic stimulus tapers off and decrease growth in China affected by energy crunch and supply chain crises following covid 19pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine-specially for Latin America it is important to diversify its interaction exposure  
- Thus, present times represent an opportune moment to deepen its engagement with the region s

- China supports Africa’s military by providing artificial intelligence

**India’s comparative advantages in Africa:**

- India enjoys substantive **soft power** in Africa and it is traced to:
- A shared colonial past.
- Indian unwavering support for the national liberation of African countries.
- No other country has a larger diaspora than India in the diaspora.
- Indian diaspora in Africa predates the British era in India, while Chinese migration has been a more recent phenomenon.
- Indian peacekeepers as well as the diaspora community respecting African traditions have integrated well into the African society.
- India is involved in various developmental projects such as the pan-Africa e network.
- The **Indian Technical and Economica Cooperation(ITEC)** program.
- **Team 9**- India and 8 West African countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Cote D’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Mali, and Senegal),  have all augmented Indian soft power.

- Indian ocean binds, rather than divides India and Africa.
- East African countries seek an Indian role in ensuring their coastal security.

**Other reasons:**

- India's expertise in IT, telecommunications, and Pharma industry is sought by Africa.
- Convergence of goals vis-a-vis global trade.
- Common goals- radicalization, climate change, skill training, etc.
- The ability of India to work with like-minded countries like Japan.

|**USA's role in the inception of ISIS:**<br><br>- The US’s key role in oustering Saddam Hussein was instrumental in creating a power vacuum within the Middle Eastern region, thus setting the stage for the rise of ISIS amidst the devastation and chaos of Iraq post-war.<br>- This, further complicated in the Arab Spring in 2011 with several autocratic regimes in the Middle East toppled, enabled ISIS to find crucial support among young disillusioned youth who were out of work and disdainful of the West.<br>- After the fall of the Gaddafi regime in Libya, the region was left without a strong leader, hence many insurgent groups emerged in the region that also had members of disbanded militias.|

**The way forward (2:40 PM):**

- The spirit of developing together as equals defines their bilateral partnership.
- India has an intrinsic interest in helping Africa achieve progress.
- Rising Africa and India can give a strong impetus to South-South Cooperation in addressing challenges in areas like clean technology, climate resilient agriculture, maritime security, and developing blue economy.
- India and Africa do not have mere transactional relations.
- They are bound close by cultural interactions and have a stake in each other’s development.

**India- South East Asia (3:08 PM):**

- Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, and Brunei.

**Historical and Civilizational ties:**

- Southern Indian Kingdoms had vibrant trade relations with South East Asia consequently along with trade, there was an exchange of culture, religion(Hinduism & Buddhism), language (Sanskrit), social customs( reverence for Brahmins and epic narratives such as **Kakavani Ramayana in Indonesia,**architecture, dance forms, music, etc.
- **Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru** referred to the region as “**Greater India”** in his book “The Discovery of India”.

**During the cold war:**

- The relations remained sparse during this phase as India remained Non-aligned with a tilt towards USSR while the South East Asian Countries were predominantly in the USA camp.
- SE Asian countries were as backward, diseased, and conflict-ridden as the Indian region itself.
- Also Indian economy was inward-looking.
- Indian outreach to the region was blocked by **post-colonial politics:**
- Hostile East Pakistan.
- Military Rule in Myanmar
- In 1991, the government of India launched the **Look East Policy** with respect to the SE Asian countries.

**Determinants of India’s Look East Policy (3:28 PM):**

- **The disintegration of the USSR-** forced India to look for new allies.
- The adoption of the **New Economic Policy** saw India look for trade partners in the vibrant economies of **South East Asia.** 
- **Look East to Look West-** With the rise in economic power, India sought to enhance strategic cooperation with the USA indirectly by enhancing cooperation with the South East Asian countries.
- **Failures of SAARC**- SAARC could not serve India’s agenda of economic growth through regional integration with its immediate neighborhood.
- This forced India to seek economic partners in its extended neighborhood of Southeast Asia.

**Indian perception in the region:**

- Indian interest in engaging more deeply in the region offered the countries of South East Asia the prospect of a democratic and non-threatening counterbalance to China.
- The USA was varied of China’s growing economic and military might spread in the region.
- Thus the USA also supported Indian outreach to the region India on the other hand which was often dismissed as a sub-continental power by engaging with South East Asia could establish itself as a regional power.
- The shared colonial experience shared cultural antiquity and despite the estrangement of the Cold War years, a striking lack of historical resentments between the two.

**Act East Policy, and its components:**

- It remains ASEAN-centric and extends to East Asia and Indo-Pacific.
- It includes wider economic and security issues.
- Presently, **ASEAN-India Free Trade Area** has been established with FTA in goods, services, and investments.
- Assertive Maritime Policy has been one of the key determinants.
- Culture and connectivity are also emphasized.
- Domestic component- **Look East through North East:**
- To effectively engage with South East Asia, the economic development of North East India would have to be ensured.
- The focus is on developing connectivity of the North Eastern region with the South East Asian region.

**India-ASEAN relations (3:52 PM):**

- India’s relationship with ASEAN is a key pillar in India’s foreign policy.

**Key Achievements:**

- In **1992,** India was admitted as a **sectoral dialogue partner** of ASEAN.
- In **1995**, India became a **full dialogue partner.** 
- In **2002,** India became a **summit-level partner.** 
- In **2012** India became a **strategic partner.**

**Economic Integration:**

- In **2009,** India **ASEAN FTA** in goods was signed.
- By **2015,** India-Asean Fre Trade Area was completed which entered into force as the **ASEAN-India Trade in Services Agreement.**

**India in ASEAN-led multilateral forums:**

- In 1996, India joined the **ASEAN Regional Forum**
- **East Asia Forum 2006:**
- India despite not being a member of SE Asia was made a founding member while the USA despite being an important power became a member only in 2008.
- This bears testimony to how very important India is considered in the Asian Balance of Powers by ASEAN.

**The topics for the next class:** Evaluation of the India- ASEAN elations, India, Myanmar relations, RCEP.
 
# International Relations Class 18
 
**The class started at 1.22 PM**  
**A brief overview of the previous class:**

- India-ASEAN relation
- Act East Policy, etc.

**Evaluation of India's relation with S-E Asia (or ASEAN): (at 1.27 PM)**

- Presently, there is a **sense** of **disillusionment** about the **present state** of the**relationship:**
- **a.** Though the Modi government's **Act East Policy** is aimed at enhancing India's strategic profile in the east and S-E Asia, New Delhi's main focus remains on South Asia and the Indian Ocean region. **India** is no match for China's regional profile in S-E Asia which is its natural zone of influence.
- **b.** India's economic focus is **not** in tune with that of other regional powers which view ASEAN as an important market for their exports and investments.
- **c.** India's interests in ASEAN as a multi-lateral forum are lacklustre.
- It continues to privilege bilateral relations. For **instance,** relations with Thailand, Indonesia and Myanmar stand out over India's relations with the entire grouping.
- India seeks membership in regional organizations because of its global power credentials even though its substantive engagement with reign remains limited.
- **d.** India's Act East Policy comprises a strong economic and strategic dimension with the expansion in scope to cover the Indo-Pacific region. But several ASEAN countries are uncomfortable with the idea of Indo-Pacific worried that it would push them to take sides between China on one hand and the USA & India on the other.
- Smaller countries are worried given their economic dependence on China of an open embrace of the Indo-Pacific concept.

**Steps were taken to bolster India-ASEAN relations: (at 1.44 PM)**  

-  India along with Japan & the USA is stepping up efforts at one of the primary sources of ASEAN's dependence on China- Infrastructure, and rail.- through initiatives like the **Indo-Pacific forum.**
- Such initiative will provide choice to **ASEAN countries** to resist the temptation of **China's Check Book Diplomacy**.

**Way Forward: (at 1.47 PM)**

- **a.** India enhanced trade and diplomacy and focus on delivering digital technology.
- **b**. Focus on early completion of connectivity projects- **India-Myanmar-Thailand**(IMT) **Trilateral Highway** (It starts from **Moreh village** in Manipur and connects to **Maesot** in Thailand), **Kaladan Multi-Model Cargo Transport project** (It aims to connect **Kolkata port** in India to Sittwe port in Myanmar and through the **Kaladan river** in Myanmar it will connect India's N-E region).
- **Transportation route**: Kolkata port to Sittwe port; Sittwe to Paletwa via Kaladan river and Paletwa to the border of India & Myanmar to Longlithe in Mizoram by road.
- This **Kaladan** project is expected to be completed by **2023**, while **IMT Trilateral Highway** by **2024.**
- **Reasons for several delays**:
- Initially, the project failed due to **several logistic challenges**.
- The **difficult terrain** and monsoonal vagarities created regular hindrances to the project
- The **law and order challenges** and deterioration of security at the construction site have created challenges.
- In 2017, the Indian army in the company of the Myanmarese army destroyed the camps of an insurgent group that is Arakkan Army which was **threatening** the**Kaladan Multimodal project**.
- Covid-19 resulted in the suspension of construction activities.
- **Importance of Kaladan project**:
- It provides an alternative route for transportation of goods from and to the North-East by allowing landlocked NER (N-E region), sea access through the Sittwe port.
- It would aid in checking **India's Chicken Neck dilemma**.
- It will reduce the cost & time for transportation of goods and could create an alternative to China in Myanmar through the opening up of such projects.
- **c.** The Bay of Bengal (**BoB**) can be used as an **exploratory ground** for the development of an Indian-ASEAN maritime framework.
- **d**. Strengthen the cultural connection between India and ASEAN; balance India's soft power.

**Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP): (at 2.49 PM)**

- It is an ideal and comprehensive agreement between ASEAN and its FTA partners (Australia, Newzealand, Japan, South Korea, China and India).
- **ASEAN** first proposed such an initiative in **2011.**
- In **2012**, at the **Cambodia summit** of ASEAN, **RCEP** began.
- In November **2019, India** announced that it wants to pull out of negotiations with RCEP.
- In November **2020,** **RCEP** came into existence and the **RCEP deal** was concluded.
- For it to take effect, the deal would have to be ratified by **six** ASEAN countries and other **three** of its FTA partners.
- On **1st** Jan **2022**, **RCEP** came into effect, **60** days after the ratification by the member countries.
- **Reasons for India not joining RCEP**:
- **a. India** has a **trade deficit** with **11** out of 15 member countries of RCEP and India does **not** have FTA with three countries like Australia, New Zealand and China.
- **b. India** advocated for "**Strict rules of Origin**" and the rest countries did not agree with it.
- **c. India** asked/wished for **"Safeguard Automatic Design".**
- **d. With respect to IPR:**
- **India** was against the stance of the rest countries on **two** grounds: **a.** Patent term extension, **b.** On Data Exclusivity.
- Several members have been pushing provisions that go **beyond TRIPS** with serious consequences for generic drug manufacturers in India.
- Agreeing to extended patent terms and data exclusivity will weaken India’s generic medicine sector.     
- **e. China factor:**
- Elimination of most duties across sectors could lead to a surge in the inflow of low-priced goods, mainly from China.
- **India** has a trade deficit in goods with China ballooning from **2003-04.**
- China might RCEP to gain more market access in India.
- NITI Aayog's report on its impact on India's trade (more Imports).
- **Pros/positives of joining RCEP by India**:
- It will further help in economic reform vis-a-vis factors of production.
- It can open up new markets for India where it has a competitive edge like ICT, healthcare, IT-enabled services, education services etc.
- RCEP can help India’s FTA with ASEAN countries.  
- **Negatives of not joining RCEP by India**:
- It will discourage FDI into India.
- It would lead to more advantages for other countries like Vietnam in certain sectors such as the textile sectors and India could lag in this to a certain extent.
- **NOTE: Kindly refer to the relevant handout given by Ayushi ma'am.**

- These groups agreed in principle to the formation of the **Union of Burma,** which became the first post-colonial government.
- However, **other** ethnic groups, most prominently the **Karen** and **Rohingya**, did**not** participate in this conference.
- The **Karen** began their **civil war** against the central government in 1949, the year after **Burma** attained independence.

- **a**. They would have agreed that the final border will be fair and just and mutually acceptable.
- **b**. The prominent geographical features would be the basis for determining the border.
- **c.** The Acknowledgment that the interests of the settled population must be taken into account.
- **How does India deal with China?**:
- Engage with China wherever possible.
- Contain (for internal capacity building, external balancing, etc) China wherever necessary. 
- Pragmatic Foreign policy.
- **Bilateral issues in India-China relations**:
- **Dams on river Brahmaputra**:
- The **Brahmaputra** is one of the longest rivers in the world and it is known as **Yarlung Zangbo** in China & Tibet region.
- a. In **2015, China** operationalized its **first hydropower project** at **Zangmu** in Tibet while other **three** dams- Dagu, Jiaxu and Jiachu- are also being developed.
- All of these dams are in the upper and middle reaches of the river.
- Also, run-of-the-river dams do not store water but rather generate electric power through the flow of the river.
- The **14th** Five Year Plan (2021-2025) has announced plans on building dams on the lower reaches of the river.
- Previously such plans did not pass the technical feasibility test because of concerns over their environmental and seismological effects.
- The dam is likely to be built on the river in Medong county where it drops by 2000 meters.    
- The new dam could help generate up to 60 GW of power, 3-times that of central China, three gorges dam which has the highest hydropower capacity in the world now.
- It will aid China to achieve carbon emission neutrality by 2060 and pay the way for the development of Tibet's autonomous region.
- **Concerns of India**: 
- Impact the quantity of river water flowing into India.
- India had initially expressed this concern over the four dams on the upper & middle reaches of Bramhaputra.
- However, these dams are not likely to greatly impact the quantity of flow of the river Brahmaputra in India because:
- **a.** They are run-of-the-river dams and do not store water
- **b.** The Brahmaputra is not entirely dependent on the upstream flow. Since an estimated 35% of its basins are in India.
- But dams on the lower reaches and at the "Great Bend"- raised fresh concerns because:
- **a.** Of their locations across their border from Arunachal Pradesh.
- **b.** Potential impact downstream. Though run-of-the-river hydropower projects, they could still renew water flows downstream, especially during the dry period.
- **c.** If China releases water from the dam, it could be disastrous for the already inundated Assam.
- **d.** As an instrument of war: China could alter river flow rate during times of stand-off between the two countries.
- **Steps/responses** were taken by the **Indian Government** on the **Brahmaputra river issue**: 
- India has urged China to be mindful of not hurting the interests of downstream states.
- GoI is also considering building a 10-GW hydropower project in Debang valley in Arunachal Pradesh to mitigate the adverse impact of the Chinese dam.
- **The existing level of water cooperation**:
- Under the existing bilateral MoU, China provides hydrological information on the river Brahmaputra and river Sutlej during the flood season.
- But during the **Doklam crisis**, China stopped the sharing of data.
- **Way forward:**
- Experts argue India should push for a comprehensive river water treaty for the Brahmaputra.
- However, given the unwillingness of China for such a comprehensive treaty India must use available technological resources, and satellite imagery to monitor the river flow.
- In this context, India may consider involving Bangladesh which is a co-riparian country to strengthen its position.
- **Trade Deficit**:
- India suffers from a persistent trade deficit of around \>$50 billion with respect to China.     
- It in fact accounts for more than 50% of India's total trade deficit.
- **Reasons**:
- a. Indian manufacturing sector is non-competitive that to China.
- b.. India is a service giant with its excellence in Pharmaceuticals and IT. But China has not liberalised the trade-in service sector.
- c. Substantive non-tariff barriers: For instance, Indian agricultural exports face barriers in form of sanitary & Phyto-sanitary measures.
- d. Bureaucratic corruption, red-tapism, etc also discourage Chinese investments in India.
- **Solutions**:
- Reforms in the manufacturing sector (Second generation economic reforms).
- Liberalization/removal of non-tariff barriers. 
- India suffers from an infrastructure deficit while China has surplus capital to invest.
- Thus by attracting Chinese investments in India, India would be able to augment its forex reserves while addressing logistics hurdles for the Indian manufacturing sector.

- **Reasons** for **issues** in this region:
- Hydropower potential.
- Tawang valley is only the fertile part of the entire region of Arunachal Pradesh.
- Identity issue in Tawang.
- The **border line** is known as the **McMohan line** along the Arunachal border. 
- **BRI and India's concerns**:
- **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)** or **One Belt One Road (OBOR) Initiative**:
- It is a **flagship** program of **Xi Jinping.**
- **One Belt initiative** was announced by Xi Jinping (in Astana, Kazakhstan) in **2013** to revive the ancient "**silk route**".
- **One Road initiative** was announced by Xi Jinping in **2014** from Indonesia for creating the **21st**-century **Maritime Silk Route.**  
- Under this **BRI initiative, China** announced **China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),** a **$46 billion** project connecting **Gwadar port** on the Arabian Sea in**Pakistan** to **China's western Xinjiang region.**
- As **CPEC** was **violating** India's territorial integrity & sovereignty (also, to the **non-transparent nature** of the BRI project), India did not join the BRI initiative of China.
- Thus **CPEC** became the **bone of contention** between India and China for further development.
- Currently, more than 100 countries have been included under the BRI of China.

- The idea of Asian solidarity.  
- **Phase-02** **(**1974-1985):
- Operation "**Smiling Buddha**", was the first Nuclear weapon test in **1974.**

- He said India-Japan relations are bilateral ties are **not** limited to trade and investment rather both countries need to rediscover each other in their hearts.  
- However, there was **no change** on the ground visibly the bilateral ties.
- In fact, in **1998, India** conducted its **second** nuclear test (**Operation Shakti**) and became a **de-facto nuclear power.**

- **Strategic coherence:**
- **a.** Both sides call for respect for international law and immediate cessation of violence in Ukraine.

- **c.** Areas of convergence: Reform of the UNSC's permanent membership.
- **AAGC** (Asia-Africa Growth Corridor), a joint Indo-Japanese initiative in Africa has**run aground.**

# International Relations Class 23
 
**BRIEF DISCUSSION ON PREVIOUS CLASS (01:09 PM)**  
**INDIA-EU RELATION (01:17 PM)**

- **Why India-EU referred to as Natural Partners** 
- We are Natural Partners Because India and the EU both believe in democracy, Human rights, and the Rule of Law. They are firm believers in Multilateralism. Thus there exist an overlap vis-a-vis their world view and consequently, they are referred to as Natural Partners. However, despite the general expectation, their strategic ties have not flourished, though they have vibrant, economic relations. 

**Economic Relations (1:29 PM)**

- EU as a block is one of the largest trading partners of India. It accounts for about 11% of India's total trade and goods. The Trade volume between the two is comparable to that between India and USA and more than India's trade with China. 
- EU is the biggest foreign investor in India.
- However, the trade relations between the two remain asymmetric. 
- India accounts for less than 2% of the EU's total trade and India was the 9th largest trading partner of the EU in 2019. 
- EU, considered China to be the most important Economic Partner in Asia at times neglecting India.
- **Why Despite being a Natural partner India-EU has had weak strategic relations:** 
- EU being a novel experiment it has created a structure and processes with which World and India are not familiar.
- The beaurocratic maze of Brussels has discouraged the pursuit of strategic relations.
- The High moral ground taken by the EU on issues of Human Rights, Democracy, Environmental laws, Labour laws, etc. discouraged strategic partnership.
- India rather prefers to engage with individual countries that understand India's concerns and engage accordingly.
- However, **Recently the need to build strategic relations has become important.** 
- **Reasons:** 
- **Rise of China:** China BRI is an important infrastructure-building initiative in Europe's extended neighbourhood of Eurasia. Also, G7 countries like Italy have joined China's initiative and presently China controls/has a presence in 1/10th of Europe's Port facilities.
- South-Asia and India ocean regions are the focus areas for Chinese BRI. Therefore, it opens opportunities for both India and the EU who are apprehensive of the geopolitical motives of BRI, to engage in a strategic partnership. 
- **Brexit:** While India looks for new partners to engage with the EU as its traditional gateway/Partner has exited the Union, Brexit has exposed weaknesses in the alliance. 
- Thus, they are searching for new partners to engage in strategic partnerships. 
- **The decline of Multilateralism:** 
- The impending fall of conventional, liberal world order, Trade wars, and No progress under WTO since the Doha Agenda has made the EU understand the Economic importance of India. 
- EU in pursuit of a strategic role in international politics: EU is showing, a growing willingness to look beyond its periphery while India seeks to engage beyond South Asia. 
- Thus, while the EU wants to emerge as a geopolitical actor, India is its natural partner in that respect. 
- Thus, the EU has proposed an **India strategy paper** 
- **Sectors of Cooperation identified in the paper:** 
- Foreign policy cooperation: They have agreed to enter into a dialogue "Bilateral or Trilateral" on Africa/With Africa. 
- Policy Coordination with respect to Afghanistan, Etc.
- Security Cooperation: Counter terrorism, Securing sea lanes of communication, and Fighting piracy off the coast of Somalia
- Maritime Cooperation: Free and Open Indo-Pacific.
- Economic Partnership with India: They seek an Ambitious, fair and mutually beneficial, Trade and investment agreement between the two. 
- **Ongoing Strategic cooperation between India and the EU:** 
-  To ensure a free and fair election in the Maldives
- At India's insistence, the EU threatened sanctions against individual officials in case of disruption or rigging of the election in the Maldives in 2019.
- Jointly Scott Food tranches of FAO to African countries under world food programme, etc. 

**BTIA (2:12 PM)**

- European Central Bank: Located in Frankfurt and established by the Treaty of Amsterdam
- European Court of Justice: Based in Luxemburg 
- EU laws have primacy over national laws. 
- Court of Auditors: It is for better financial management.

**INDIA-RUSSIA RELATIONS (03:15 PM)**

- Indian-Russian relations are time-tested and historically deep and without any hidden agenda. 
- In fact, India and Russia have a genuine interest in each other Rise
- India and Russia were among the first in the world to establish the practice of annual bilateral summits.
- The XXIst Summit was held in December 2021 in New Delhi in-person despite the COVID-19 pandemic. 
- **Timeline:** 
- 1971- India and the Soviet Union entered into a peace and friendship treaty. 
- In the Year 2000, India signed its first strategic partnership agreement With Russia. They start with Annual summits.
- 2010: They established a Special and Privilege Partnership and Presently the relations are referred to as Special Strategic and Privileged relationships.
- In the wake of the Russian Ukrainian crisis, the Indian Government has been soft on Russia. 
- **Evidence:** 
- India has abstained From every UN resolution dealing with the matter and refused to join the international communities in imposing Economic sanctions against Moscow. 
- The reported Mass Killing of Ukrainian Civilians, while India has condemned it but has stopped short of apportioning on any party instead, has called for An Impartial Investigation.
- **Reasons:** 
- Moscow is a strategic partner. India counts on it to Veto any adverse UNSC resolution on the issue of Kashmir.
- They have used their veto power 6 times to protect India. 
- Given the recent tension over Kashmir, India wants Moscow on its side.
- India is hopeful of Russian support or at least its neutrality in its longstanding water dispute with PRC or China
- During the recent skirmishes along the India-China border, India acquired weapons from Russia. 
- In fact, it is the India-Russia strategic partnership that has prevented it formation of the Russia-China Alliance in wake of West sanctions against Russia. 
- Russia has a supplier of Weapons. India is acutely dependent on Russia for a range of weaponry. 60-70% of India's conventional arsenal is of Soviet or Russian Origin. 
- Despite India's attempt at diversification of its weapon acquisition, nearly 60% of such equipment is purchased from Russia. 
- India's Defence relation with Russia that it is non-existent with any other country. Russia is the only country which leases India Nuclear attack submarines.
- No other country has been willing to share India's equivalent weaponry. 
- Not only do we have Buyer-seller relations but they engage in technology transfer, Joint development and Marketing of Weapons. 
- For an instance, the 2 countries have co-produced the versatile BrahMos Missile. 
- Also, Russia provides India with High-technology Weaponry at prices significantly lower than any western Supplier. 
- India Russia cooperation vis-a-vis Civil-Nuclear energy.
- Following the US India civil Nuclear agreement of 2008 Russia int an agreement to build 6 Nuclear reactors in the Country. 
- Unlike the West, which because of India's nuclear liability law (that holds the manufacturer of the plant or its component liable) has not invested in India's civilian nuclear sector, the Russian government by assuming the necessary liability in the event of a nuclear accident has been able to enter Nuclear power sector in India.
- Western governments are unwilling to provide such guarantees to their commercial companies and have been unable to match the Russian presence in India. 
- Energy Security: ONGC has been involved in the extraction of fossil fuels from the Sakhalin Islands of Russia in the Pacific Ocean. 
- Impact of India's Stand: India fears that Western sanctions will drive Russia toward China's Military and Economic Orbit. 

**TOPIC FOR THE NEXT CLASS: WILL CONTINUE WITH THE INDIA-RUSSIA RELATION.**
 
# International Relations Class 24
 
**Recap of the previous class discussion.  (05:10:00 PM)**  
**Positive Impact of India-Russia Relationship with respect to India’s Stand on Ukraine (05:13:00 PM)**  
**Reset ties with China**

- By standing up to the unprecedented pressure from Washington, New Delhi might succeed in dissuading China from perpetrating further aggression on the border.
- Beijing has been over the years wary of India’s rise as an American Allies in the Indo-Pacific.
- It has routinely decried the QUAD as a containment mechanism for China.
- Seen in that context, Beijing’s transgression on the border with India is part strategic attempt to keep India tied up in the Himalayas and less able to play a more proactive regional and global role.
- But, Beijing sees India as an unwilling member of the Western Liberal Order. It may seek to reset ties with New Delhi.
- In fact, when the Chinese foreign minister visited India recently there were indications that Beijing wants India and China to coordinate their role in multilateral affairs.
- For the continental containment of China, Russia is important.
- Since 2014, when Russia internationally isolated. Russia has come closer to China.

**In other Areas**

- With India prioritizing its relations with Russia, India is effectively preventing a Russia-China Alliance from Emerging.
- While India seeks to balance China in the maritime sphere through the Indo-Pacific strategy in which its partnership with the USA is pivotal, to contain China continentally its relations with Russia become critical (through a platform like SCO, and RIC).
- While the USA initially pressurized India to get its foreign policy vis a vis Russia Ukrainian War aligned with the USA, recently it finally recognized the “distinct” nature of India-Russia Relations.
- US Secretary of state recently noted that India’s relationship with Russia has developed over the decades when the US was not able to be a partner with India. He suggested that Washington now was prepared to be that partner.
- In the recent past India had resisted threats of sanctions under the CAATSA by purchasing S400 triumf Missiles from Russia.
- It bolstered India’s image as an important global power able to resist international pressures while upholding its national interest through its pursuit of “Strategic Autonomy”.

**Negative Impact of India’s Stand**

- Moral such as India cannot criticize China when it invades India.
- Besides that, India could not ask for help from the west in such aggression.

**China Factor in India-Russia Relations  (05:42:00 PM)**

- Political disagreement between India-Russia over China.
- For Russia, China has become its all-around strategic partner specially against the backdrop of Moscow’s isolation from the west.
- But for India, China is a primary threat.
- This in fact has necessitated that India develops closer strategic partnership with the US and other like Australia and Japan who shares similar threat perceptions of China.
- While for the Russia-China partnership countering the USA is central to it.

**Growing Military Engagement between Russia and China:** 

- Russia’s selling advanced weaponry and major defense platforms to China such as Kilo-class submarine, and Su-35 fighter jets, which could further aggravate the military imbalance between India and China is source of worry for India.
- These have created wrinkles in India-Russia relations

**Wrinkles in India-Russia Relations  (05:51:00 PM)**

- **Evidence:** Cancelation of their bilateral annual meeting in 2020.
- Though MEA said that the summit was canceled on account of the COVID pandemic, but given that other international summits and meetings were being held virtually, the explanation for the complete cancelation of the summit was not entirely convincing.
- There were indications that the summit was canceled due to severe reservations of Moscow on New Delhi joining the QUAD and the Indo-Pacific initiative.
- Russian foreign minister has criticized these initiatives and said that the west was pushing India to play a big role in its anti-China policies like Indo-Pacific and Quad.
- **Response of Government of India:** Indian MEA has responded by saying that “India has always maintained an independent foreign policy premised on its own national interest’. India’s Indo-Pacific was not focused on any particular country.
- India also added that its foreign policy relations with a particular country stand independent of its relations with other countries.

**Conclusion** 

- Despite the recent misgivings between Russia and India over China, Russia's relations with India forms the basis of the limits of its strategic partnership with China. Apart from structural limitations to Russia and China relations.
- The border dispute with respect to Russia’s far-east.
- China challenges Russia's leadership in Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
- Rather than allowing a third country to emerge as a source of the disagreements between the traditional partners India and Russia, the three should work in areas of common interest to them such as insistence on multipolarity, reducing American Hegemony within the global financial system, challenging USA’s unilateralism, and cooperate vis a vis climate change.

**Indo-Pacific Policy and Russia (06:12:00 PM)**

- The declassified Indo-Pacific classification of the USA mentions China and **not**Russia as the security threat in the region. However, Russia has been extremely critical of the initiative and of India’s participation in it.

**India has consistently made effort to draw Russia into its formulation of the Indo-Pacific**

- **Reasons:** Overlapping visions, Under Russia’s Greater Eurasian Partnership concept, it would want to achieve an ideal geo-economic and geopolitical position as the center of Eurasia and it would act as a friendly counter-balance to China so that it does not become too strong and a political hegemon in the region.
- India’s Indo-Pacific vision has a similar aim. India stands for **Open and Inclusive Indo-Pacific** in which Russia’s participation makes it multi-polar.
- They both want to avoid the hegemony of any power in the region be it USA or China in the region.

**Evidence of India attempting to bring Russia into its the formulation of Indo-Pacific:**

- India insists on the active presence and participation of Russia in the Indo-Pacific contrary to the aim of the USA which wants Russia to be a marginal player in the region.
- India launched its Act Far East Policy for increasing cooperation with Russia’s far East. NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Development of Russia's far East and Arctic are working on a plan to develop Russia’s the Far East between 2020 to 2025.
- Under this policy itself, India wants to launch Chennai Vladivostok Maritime Russia’s far east is a relatively underdeveloped region that lacks manpower.
- India with its abundant manpower such as professors, doctors, and engineers can help in the development of the region.
- While helping address the Russian concerns over the Chinese migration into the region.
- These sea routes when open will enable the transfer of Cargo between the two cities in 24 days in comparison to over 40 days currently taken to transport goods from India to Russia via Europe.
- Help India harness fossil fuel reserves as well as mineral resources (gold, platinum, diamond, and natural resources like timber).
- India wants to partner with Russia in the opening of Northern Sea Routes for trade and commerce.
- The existing route connecting East Asia to Western Europe passes through the Malacca strait, Suez Canal, and the Mediterranean Sea.
- It is approximately 21000 Km long and takes about 48 days to traverse.
- The Northern Sea Route will traverse the Arctic Ocean along the Russian Northern Borders and reduces the distance between East Asia and Western Europe to 12800 Km which would take around 35 days.
- But the problem is the presence of Sea Ice, except from May till September, the surface water of the Arctic Ocean remains frozen.
- To make this route feasible it will have to be cleared from the Sea Ice to allow for uninterrupted highways throughout the year.
- **Russia will be the primary actor vis a vis the northern sea route.**
- **Reasons:** Since the Northern Sea route lies well within the Russian Arctic Coast (Russia’s Western borders to Bering Strait), Russia will extend its influence through the route.
- Russia has the world's largest fleet of ice breakers ships to break the Sea Ice.
- It also has nuclear-powered Ice Breakers.
- India is also exploring the possibility of trilateral cooperation with Japan in Russia's far East.

**Conclusion**

- These efforts of India are aligned with **Russia’s Pivot to Asia** which was launched in 2014 after Moscow’s Relations with the US and Europe hit the nadir following the Creamian Crisis.

**Weakness of India-Russia Relations   (06:55:00 PM)**  
**Economic Relations**

- While during the cold war era the Soviet Union was India’s biggest trade partner, post-economic liberalization countries like China, the US, and UAE have emerged as India’s primary trade partners is about a hundred billion dollars annually.
- The bilateral trade between India and Russia has been very low, India’s ‘least with the P5 countries’.
- Both countries are absent in the respective list of top 15 trading partners.
- They account for a meagre 1% with each-others total trade volume.
- Reasons for such weak trade relations: Distance and connectivity is the primary reason.
- While transport of goods between Russia and China or Europe takes a maximum of one to two weeks in comparison it takes 40 to 50 days for the transport of goods between India and Russia.
- Restrictive trade policy in many areas.
- Weak banking links between two countries.
- Bureaucratization and cumbersome regulation on both sides.
- Restrictive Visa regime of Russia.
- **Solution**: Alternative routes connecting India and Russia such as early operationalization of INSTC corridor.
- Opening up a maritime route connecting Chennai to Vladivostok will also give impetus to cooperation between India and Russia far-east.
- Expedite free trade negotiation between India and Russia led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU).
- It comprises founding members Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, and other members are Armenia and Kyrgistan. EEU is a customs union.
- Encourage the role of the private sector and develop the necessary banking links.
- Correct the trade imbalance which is presently tilted in Russia’s favour since areas like defense, energy, and civil nuclear energy, dominate the trade relations.
- The areas of India’s strength like the IT sector, pharmaceuticals, and health, should figure more prominently in India’s basket to make the trade relations balance

**Some other Concerns in India-Russia Relations  (07:31:00 PM)**

- **India’s Defense Diversification:** Unlike the Soviet Era Russia is not the primary/near absolute supplier of defense equipment to India. 
- Despite the unprecedented India-Russia defense relations India actively seeks defense procurement diversification from countries like the US, Israel, France, etc.
- While Russia's share of India’s defense imports fell from about 80% in 2008-12 to 62% between 2013 to 2017, India’s defense imports from the USA increased from almost 0 in the late 1990s to more than 20 billion dollars in 2022.
- **Russia-Pakistan Relations:** driven in part by Moscow’s concern on Afghanistan relations with Pakistan have taken an uptick in the recent past.
- They conducted a military exercise in 2016, signed a military agreement and the long-maintained arms embargo on Pakistan was diluted when Moscow sold attack helicopters to Rawalpindi.
- The embargo has been re-imposed following India’s concerns.
- Russia’s Recognition of Taliban.

**India-US Relations (07:45:00 PM)**  
**(Explanation)**

- India and US are the natural allies.
- Liberal democracy. One oldest and one largest democracy.
- The US is not a believer in multilateralism.
- Democracy is about our choice but we do not believe in imposing democracy on gunpoint (exception in West Asia).
- Both have been estranged democracies from 1950 to 2000.
- We became engaged democracies from 2000. From 2000 there has been no looking back and relation has been deepened continuously.
- **1****st** **Phase: 1947 to 1970**: The phase of cooperation and conflict.
- During this phase the USA and USSR wanted India to be in their own camp.
- The US wanted a huge economy like India to be in their camp. In the 1971 war, the US sent warships to create pressure on India.
- **1970 to 1990s:** Phase of conflict.
- **1991 onwards:** India has no other option but pursues a friendship with the sole superpower USA.
- **2000 Onwards:** After the nuclear test, there was a negotiation between India and USA.
- A comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two started. It was Bill Clinton's Administration that entered such relations.
- With the rise of China, the USA finds India as an important balancing power.
- **Biggest Area of cooperation:** Defense has emerged as the primary pillar between the two.
- Barak Obama mentioned India as the major defense partner. It started with Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation.
- **Indo-Pacific** is another major area of cooperation between India and the US.
- Under Indo-Pacific QUAD has emerged as an important platform
- I2U2: Israel-UAE and India-US.

**QUAD under Indo-Pacific as an Area of Cooperation   (08:03:00 PM)**

- It began as a loose partnership after the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.
- Four countries joined together to provide humanitarian and disaster assistance to the affected region.
- In 2007, the first meeting of QUAD took place and the concept of the QUAD was formulated.
- However, it became dormant for a decade due to Australia’s concern that its participation would irate China.
- India was also reluctant because it worried that rivalry with China will keep India out of NSG.

**The topic for the next class discussion:** Further discussion on India-US relations.
 
# International Relations Class 25
 
**QUAD(continued (1:30 PM):**

- QUAD was revived in 2017 as QUAD 2.0.

**Reasons for the revival of QUAD:**

- **Growing Chinese belligerence**- Between 2013 and  2020, each QUAD member experienced Chinese aggression under the reign of Xi Jinping.
- Japan experienced Chinese coercive behavior near the Senkaku islands in 2012.
- Trade imbalance caused tensions between Washington and Beijing.
- The Doklam Standoff in 2017 and the Galvan incident in 2020 soured Sino-Indian ties.
- China has built artificial islands in the **South China Sea** and militarised them.
![SOUTH CHINA Nuha](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604061631-15.png)- All four members of Quad have vested interests in upholding rules and norms of the current order, augmenting the existing institutions, and ensuring freedom of navigation and trade.

**Quad Summits:**

- All the four countries and the USA under both Trump and the Biden administrations see Quad as a key to their **Asian Pivot**( placing more focus on the Indo-Pacific region), particularly as a counterweight to China’s assertive actions.

|   |
|---|
|**The reasons for the  belligerent Chinese foreign policy:**<br><br>- The birth of the **People’s Republic of China (PRC)** was not only the beginning of a new regime, but it also marked the ending of the **Century of Humiliation (1839-1949),** in which foreign powers subjected, manipulated, colonized, and occupied China.<br>- These experiences have also been a tool in China’s relationships with the wider world as well as a unifying force within China, the legacy of which persists in the light of current tensions.|

**Institutionalisation of Quad:**

- In March 2021, the first Quad Leaders Summit took place.
- In September, the first in-person summit took place.
- In March 2022, another summit in virtual format.
- In May 2022, the summit was held in person.

**Expansion of membership**:

- South Korea has expressed its interest in joining the QUAD, but Quad is not contemplating any adjustments to its membership.
- Quad has held **“Quad-Plus meetings “** with South Korea, New Zealand, and Vietnam.
- These countries could form the future members of the expanded quad.

**Achievements of QUAD:**

- In the past year, QUAD has transformed from a largely strategic, theoretical grouping based on ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific.
- The specific sectors of cooperation such as cooperation vis-à-vis Covid, technology, Climate change, space, and cyber security have been identified.
- An  **Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA**)  will collate satellite imagery to offer near-real-time maritime mapping, track dark shipping, and piracy, and provide disaster relief.
- They agreed vis-a-vis QUAD cyber security partnership and to work closely on space observation programs.
- They will extend more than **$50 million USD** in the Indo-Pacific region over the next five years.
- They have agreed to distribute 1 billion Covid-19 vaccines in Asia as a counter to Chinese vaccine diplomacy.
- They will cooperate vis-à-vis critical technologies such as on 5-G supplier diversification (beyond Huawei), ensure resilient supply chains for semiconductor supplies, and on Open-RAN( Radio Access Network).
- For **People-to-people ties**: QUAD fellowship for 100 students from the member countries to the USA each year to pursue graduate degrees in **STEM** (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).

**Lacunae of Quad (2:00 PM):**

- QUAD still does not put its money where its mouth is- at a time when USA’s funding to Ukraine has crossed $54 billion, the $50 Billion in 5 years for infrastructure development from the four countries cumulatively seems relatively small.
- QUAD fellowships would be primarily privately funded.
- The **IPEF (Indo-pacific Economic Framework),** though not a part of QUAD but part of the Indo-Pacific vision is not a trade deal.
- The strategic depth is quite shallow as there exist no QUAD level military-to-military arrangements for example in **SCO**.
- Without such an arrangement, countering China would be difficult.
- Even over China, QUAD members have differences: for instance- while all quad member countries supported **Taiwan** to be included as an observer at the **World Health Assembly**, except for India.
- Within QUAD, India’s close relationship with **Russia**, and its membership in RIC, BRICS, and SCO stand out.
- Vis-a vis covid vaccines, the vaccines have not been distributed.
- Thus, QUAD is still a work in progress and primarily driven by top-down summits.
- It needs more teeth to achieve its agenda.
- Thus, as PM Modi has mentioned on several occasions, QUAD’s intention is to be a force for good and the areas in which it seeks to cooperate are growing.

**India and Quad:**  
**Advantages for India:**

- To counter-balance China in the Indo-Pacific region.
- Through Quad, India can rise above its middle-power status and project its influence beyond the Indo-Pacific.
- **For example**- it was thought the Japanese technology, Indian vaccine production capacity, Australian supply chains, and American capital to provide the 1 billion covid vaccines.

|   |
|---|
|**Vaccine Nationalism:**<br><br>- When a country manages to secure doses of vaccines for its own citizens or residents and prioritizes its own domestic markets before they are made available in other countries it is known as ‘vaccine nationalism’.<br>- This is done through pre-purchase agreements between a government and a vaccine manufacturer.|

- India’s bilateral relations with these bilateral countries are being strengthened.
- **For example**- with Australia, India has signed an information sharing agreement and a mutual logistics support agreement.
- With **Japan**, India has signed **Acquisition and Cost Servicing Agreement (ACSA).**
- **The General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSMIA)** has been signed with the USA.

**Challenges posed by Quad for India(2:25 PM):**

- Possibility of reactivating tensions with China on different fronts.
- This makes it imperative for new Delhi to ensure that QUAD is not reduced to an **Anti-China** grouping.
- India and China are also members of groupings like BRICS and SCO and containing China through QUAD would undermine India’s involvement in these organizations.
- India’s involvement in QUAD could risk alienating our two important allies- Iran and Myanmar since their growing closeness with China.
- China in 2021 concluded a $ 400 billion deal with Iran while the recent coup in Myanmar has forced the Junta Regime to seek diplomatic and economic refuge in China amidst the western sanctions.
- Among the QUAD members, only India shares its borders with China.
- If India engages militarily with QUAD, there emerges a risk of Chinese aggression at the borders.
- While QUAD is important to contain China in the maritime domain, India seeks partnership with **Russia** through platforms of SCO and RIC to continentally balance China.
- In the present context of the severe deterioration of the West’s relations with Russia, India in QUAD was the only country that abstained from UNSC resolutions on Russia.
- Other QUAD members have also been openly critical of Russia.
- However, in the recent Tokyo summit, the Quad members accommodated India’s **“Distinct relations with Russia”.**

**Concerns vis-a vis AUKUS (Australia, UK, and USA )undermining QUAD:**

- The United States announced on 15 September 2021 that the US and the UK will help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines.
- It is a security grouping to contain China.
- Under it, the USA has agreed to share sensitive nuclear submarine technology with Australia.

**What does it mean for India and QUAD:**

- QUAD can maintain its broad agenda and it does not have to commit to an explicit Anti-China security framework.
- Thus, QUAD will continue as a plurilateral grouping with a vision for a free, open, transparent, and inclusive Indo-Pacific.
- This augurs well for India since India was reluctant to militarily balance China under Quad.
- India insists on QUAD having a” positive and constructive agenda”, i.e. not “**against someone, but for something”.**
- Under AUKUS, the USA is sharing coveted technology(Nuclear Submarine) with one QUAD partner (Australia) and not with others.
- India wishes to balance China without being the one to balance China.
- AUKUS also undercuts USA’s NATO ally, **France** in the process as France earlier had the Scorpene Submarine deal with Australia, and has a considerable presence in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans.
- If AUKUS leads to the weakening of the French and the broader European Commitment to the Indo-Pacific, then it would only diminish the efficacy of the nascent security architecture and deterrence framework in the region.
- Thus France and India reached out to each other after the AUKUS commitment to France.
- France assured India to strengthen India’s strategic autonomy including its Industrial and technological base as a part of their close relations.

**Indian challenges for QUAD (2:55 PM):**

- The problem of the Indian “**delivery deficit**” coupled with the increase of BRI projects in the area could create severe issues for the QUAD initiatives, especially with respect to those projects in which India would be playing a leading role.

Despite the reservations, **Quad is very important to India as :**

- It can provide a long-term strategy to deter China in the region.
- Especially given that the Chinese strategy till now has been less about economic investment.
- At the same time, QUAD keeps the door open for India for close defense cooperation without resorting to joining a military alliance.
- A QUAD without India would immediately lose “Indo” in the “Indo-Pacific”.
- It is a partnership of mutual gain and to strengthen QUAD, the USA should make it clear to India and Japan that they are as valued as members as Australia.
- Including establishing a secretariat, formalizing the structure would facilitate multilateral cooperation.

**Chinese criticisms of QUAD:**

- It terms QUAD as **“Asian NATO”.**

**It is not so because:**

- There is no mutual defense pact.
- USA has clarified that QUAD is a “Non-Defense, Non-Military arrangement”.
- The military cooperation that takes place between the member countries is at a bilateral level.
- Though all the QUAD countries participate in the Malabar exercise, it is not held under the QUAD framework.

**Chinese criticisms (continued):**

- Since the QUAD countries are collectively trying to challenge China’s growing influence, for instance by pledging to distribute 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines against Chinese vaccine diplomacy, or Quad’s focus on technology such as 5-G whereby Australia, Japan, and the USA have already banned Chinese communication provider Huawei.
- China has accused the QUAD to form enclosed small cliques as the sure way to destroy the existing international order.
- Some time back, the Chinese foreign minister had dismissed QUAD as a “**Seafoam**” that will eventually dissipate.
- Contrary to Chinese belief, the QUAD has been referred to as the primarily plurilateral platform for the member countries.

**The differences between India’s and USA’s Indo-Pacific Policy (3:33 PM):**

- Despite the closeness, the Indo-Pacific policies of both of them are not in complete sync which can be seen as:

**Geographical expanse:**

- For the USA, the Indo-Pacific region terminates at the western coast of India, while for India it extends from the East African Coast to the Pacific Coast of the USA i.e, West Asia and Eastern Africa are part of the Indo- Pacific region.

**Dimensions:**

- India gives substantial importance to the continental dimension of the Indo-Pacific since it is both a land and maritime power.
- However, the USA privileges the balancing of China in the maritime domain.
- American sanctions on Iran and the subsequent pressure on Idia to limit its ties with Tehran are evidence of the same.

**Priority:**

- The USA gives more priority to the Pacific ocean, while the Indian immediate priority is the Indian ocean.

Thus, the USA has sought to pursue the military balancing of China through AUKUS by sharing nuclear submarine technology with Australia.

- It seeks to reduce strategic pressure on itself.

**I2U2:**

- It is a grouping of India, Israel, UAE, and the USA.
- It is also known as the “**West Asian Quad”** and recently it has been given the name-**International Forum for Economic Cooperation.**

**Background for I2U2:**  
**Abraham Accords:**

- The Abraham Accord was signed between the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Bahrain in August 2020.
- It was mediated by the United States.
- The Abraham accord countries went into a joint agreement that formalized their relationships.
- According to the agreement, the UAE and Bahrain will establish a ministry and agent to support Israel in tourism, trade, medical, security, etc.

**Indo Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF):**

- **Member countries**- Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, USA, India, ASEAN economies( Thailand, Philippines Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Indonesia).
- They represent 40% of the global GDP.
- It is not a traditional trade deal and therefore the associated skepticism as to what it wil deliver.
- It represents the idea of “Alternative Trade Arrangement” led by the USA.

**The four pillars under IPEF:**

- **Connected Economy-** Setting standards o digital trade, Cross Border data flow, and data localization.
- **Resilient Economy-** Supply chain commitments and guarding against sudden price spikes.
- **Clean Economy-** Commitments to the clean economy, decarbonization, and infrastructure to cut emissions.
- **Fair Economy**- In terms of enforcing regimes that cut down on money laundering and corruption, and ensure fair taxation.
- Thus IPEF is about standard setting and facilitating trade.
- It will not negotiate and lower tariffs or greater market access for its members.
- As negotiations proceed, more areas of cooperation may be incorporated.
- There is an option of members adopting a **Pick and Choose attitude- countries** can join only those pillars that interest them.
- This concept has been developed to attract more members, but it raises questions about the effectiveness of the framework.

**Why USA has gone for IPEF (4:06 PM):**

- It is a part of the USA’s pivot to Asia program.
- It is a way for the USA to keep its foot in the door on trade in Asia after it withdrew itself from the **Comprehensive & Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)** in 2017, and since the USA is not a part of **RCEP.**

**The course has been completed**, and some rest portions would be given in notes
