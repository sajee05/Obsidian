 - The hierarchy in the Mughal Court:
![fihk7gh Ad9aru n](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604060100-1.png)- The power flowed in the following sequence:
- Mughal Emperor -\> Wazir (Prime Minister): The most important minister.
- Nobility : After the wazir. They were generally jaghirdars, etc.
- Nobility consisted of ==Turkish (Turrani), Persian (Irani), Afghans (Durrani) and Hindustani nobles.== 
### **Mansabdari System:**

- It is a Persian word, meaning ‘official position’.
- It was the system of ranking the officials in the Mughal Kingdom, which was initiated by Emperor Akbar.
- It had two components, i.e. ‘Zat’ and ‘Sawar’. _Zat:_- ==Zat== is indicative of the ==personal rank of a Mansabdar== in the official hierarchy.
- The ranking system started from 100 till 5000, but Mughal princes and the closest allies or kings of exceptional capabilities were given the 7000 rank.
- The highest rank is 7000, Lowest was 100.
- For the general public, the ranks of 100 to 5000 were given, 7000 was reserved for the Mughal sons.
- Many times the 7000 rank was given to many important allies, kings of exceptional capabilities.
- Methods of salary payment was Cash (or Nakadi) and Land payment (Jagirdari) to Mansabdars
- Whenever the payment was in the cash, the officer was known as the ‘Nakadi’ Mansabdar. (Nakadi= Persian for cash)
- And those who got land grants were known as Jagirdars (jagir = land grant in form of a piece of land). 
1. **Tankhwah Jagir** (given for a temporary period, not hereditary and non-transferable).
2. **Watan Jagir** (Given permanently, was hereditary and transferable).

- Near about 80% of the land was granted as jagir, and 20% was Khalisa land, i.e. Royal land (directly under the Emperor). _Sawar:_- It reflected up to the responsibilities of the Mansabdars, towards the Mughal Empire.
- It is indicative of th==e number of horses== to be maintained by the Mansabdar in the Army for the service of Mughal Emperor. 
**Jagirdars:**

- They were Mughal Nobles who were granted _Jagir_ in lieu of their service.
- They needed to collect revenue and maintain an army for the service of the Mughal Empire.
- Land grants were ==temporary in nature.== 
**Zamindars:**

- They were hereditary landlords, local powerful rajas, local chieftains, and they also were part of Mughal Nobility.
- They needed to collect revenue, from their respective areas.
- They also had judicial powers and they needed to maintain law and order in their area.
- Land grants were ==permanent in nature.== 
The decline of Mughals began with the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, though the factors of decline were already present from the 17th century itself. The causes can be enumerated as follows:
 
**Political causes:**

- Aurangzeb’s expansionist campaigns in Bijapur, Golconda, and Maratha area are believed to have sapped the vitality of the Mughal Empire.
- After the death of Aurangzeb, there was ==no clear line of succession==, in between 1707 to 1720, near about 7 rulers were appointed to the throne.
- ==Bitter factionalism in Mughal Court== was precipitated, whereby the Irani, Turrani, Durrani, and Hindustani nobles started to increase their influence and later on they carved out autonomous states from themselves. 
**Economic Causes:**

- The Mughal state has been described as a ==‘war state’ i==n its core.
- It sought to develop a centralized administrative system (Mansabdari), whose vitality depended on the military might of the Mughals.
- The Jagirdari Crisis also involved the emergence of too many Jagirdars chasing for very few Jagirs.
- These Jagirs were highly unequal in size which triggered intense competition with the nobility.
- Aurangzeb converted a large part of the Deccan region into Khalisa land (i.e. royal land).
- And thus even expansion into Deccan did not significantly increase the number of available jagirs.
- Attempts to increase revenue by increasing tax rates often resulted i==n peasant revolt== against the rulers. 
**Socio-Religious Causes:**

- The religious divisive policy of Aurangzeb was one of the most important factors of decline.
- For example; re-imposition of ==Jizya tax== and destruction of Hindu temples.
- Because of which people developed a grudge against the Mughals. 
**Military related Causes:**

- There was no fresh ==technological== ==input== in the Mughal army during the 18th century.
- And thus, when faced with a superior opponent, i.e. British, the Mughal army proved to be inferior. 
# Emergence of Regional Powers in 18th Century:

1. Successor states (Bengal, Awadh, Hyderabad)
2. Rebellious states (Punjab, Maratha, Mysore)
 
### Successor states of Mughals:
 - The rulers of these states were the erstwhile nobility of the Mughals or they were Mughal Governors.
- They went on to carve out autonomous states for themselves.
- But they did not cut their links completely with the Mughals.
- They **respected the nominal rule of the Mughals.**
- Coins were minted with the name of the Mughal Emperor.
- Friday prayers were done in the name of Mughal emperors.
- They also paid annual tributes to the Mughal Emperor.
- E.g.: Hyderabad, Bengal, Awadh. 
### Rebellious States:

- Founders of these states were not part of Mughal nobility.
- These were independent kingdoms, but during the regime of Mughals(Aurangzeb), some of their areas came under Mughal control.
- After the death of Aurangzeb, the rulers of these states asserted their independence and autonomy.
- They did not accept the nominal rule of the Mughals.
- E.g.: Punjab, Marathas, Mysore.

- Around the 1740s the political affairs in Carnatic started to deteriorate because of Marathas invasion.
- At this time the French company decided to intervene in Carnatic politics to get political mileage.
- Very soon the English Company also started to intervene in the politics of Carnatic.

- These wars are referred to as **Carnatic Wars**. 
### FIRST CARNATIC WAR (1742-1748):
 - The war of Austrian succession which started on 20th October 1740 after the death of Monarch Charles-IV led to the outbreak of the Carnatic Wars.
- ==Britain== was supporting the claim of ==Maria Theresa & France supported Robert Charles Albert.== #remember-for-later
- This led both the companies to fight with each other, i.e The French & British companies present in the different parts of the world also started to fight with each other.
- French Governor **Joseph Francois Dupleix** decided to attack British possessions in Madras.
- As a result, the English surrendered Madras to the French.
- Meanwhile, the British also appealed to Nawab of Carnatic(Anwaruddin) for help.
- Anwaruddin sent his army to fight the French. But he was defeated.
- However, the end of the Austrian war of succession also led to the end of the 1st Carnatic War with the **Treaty of Aix La Chappelle.**

### SECOND CARNATIC WAR (1749-1754):

![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250604060109-3.png)  
_British Response:-_- In the beginning the attitude of the British was callous.
- But when a new general Saunders came to India, he felt the need for activity.
- At this time a young clerk Robert Clive volunteered to fight and suggested creating a diversion by attacking Arcot, the capital of Carnatic
- **Siege of Arcot** ==- Rob==ert Clive was a young British captain who attempted to seize Arcot with near about 200 British/European soldiers & 300 Indian Soldiers.

- **Treaty of Paris(1763) signed -\>** As per the terms of the treaty Chandranagore & Pondicherry was returned to the French.
- They were also allowed to retain their possessions prior to 1749.

- Prior to Plassey, trade with Bengal was financed from Bullion imported from Europe.
- But after Plassey, it was exported from Bengal to other parts of India and China for trade purposes.
 - **Mir Jafar:**
- Jafar’s growing dependence on the company for military support, was used by the company to demand more finance  by the company At this juncture, nawab decided to enlist the help of the Dutch but British thwarted his attempts by defeating the Dutch in the **Battle of Bidara (1759)** and removed Mir Jafar from power. - **Mir Qasim:**

## Pillars of British administration
 
### **Civil Services**

- The creator of modern civil services in India was Lord Cornwallis.
- Earlier Court of Directors exercised the power of nominating the civil servants resulting in favouritism and corruption.
- Cornwallis tried to address this problem by banning private trade, raising salary, and enforcing promotion based on seniority.
- At this time, EIC civil servants were the highest-paid civil services in the world.
- Cornwallis adopted a short-sighted policy of the Europeanization of services.
- He made sure that no Indian must enter Civil Services.
- It was officially led down that all the higher posts in administration, worth more than 500-pound annual salary could be held only by English.
- In order to provide training to Civil servants, Governor-General Wellesley established Civil servants training college at Fort Williams, Calcutta.
- But later it was disapproved by the court of Directors in Britain.
- They established a separate Civil Servant Training Institute at Haileybury in England in 1806. 
### **Army**

- There were 2 branches of the British army:
    
    1. Queen's army - There were only Britishers in Queen's army, It was the army of occupation and ultimate guarantee of British hold over India.
    2. Troops Army - This army had British Officers and Indian soldiers, It was the army of annexation, fighting wars, and expansion of British territory.
- Native against native approach was used with the concept of martial races.
- The Britishers were quite sure since the beginning that they could not dominate India without creating divisions in Indian Society.
- In the theory of the Martial race, they claimed that Gurkha, Rajput, Sikh, Pathan be the Martial races.
- The bulk of the Company's army was comprised of Indian Soldiers (86%).
- Keeping a British army would have been a very expensive affair.
- All officers were British.
- The highest post that an Indian can reach was Subedar.
- It is surprising that a handful of Britishers could control a predominant Indian Army.
- The control by the British could be attributed to the absence of modern nationalism in India at that time.
- Also, Indians had a strong tradition of loyalty towards the salt, As such Indian soldiers acted as good mercenaries and British as good pay masters. 
### **Police**

- In Pre-colonial India, particularly during the Mughal period, law and order were the responsibility of Amils, Faujdars, and Kotwals.
- In Bihar, Bengal and Orissa Zamindars were also responsible for maintaining law and order.
- Zamindars created their own personal for the duty of law and order in their area i.e. Thanedar.
- Later it was observed that there was often dereliction of duty on the part of Zamindar which necessitated a change in the law and order system.
- Cornwallis relieved all Zamindars from the duty of maintaining law and order.
- Zamindars were replaced by an organized police force under the command of EIC.
- Districts were divided into different circles known as Thana, to manage the affairs of Thana a Daroga was appointed.
- SP was appointed at the district level.
- William Bentick abolished the office of SP and placed law and order under the District Collector.
- In 1860, the Police Commission was appointed which led to the enaction of the Police Act, 1861. 
### **Judiciary**

- The initiative to start the modern judiciary system was taken by Warren Hastings.
- Diwani Adalat was set up based on the Mughal model and it was responsible for trial of civil cases, Sadr Diwani Adalat was the appellate body. ( i.e. appeals from diwani Adalat entertained here)
- Faujadari Adalat was created for criminal cases, from there Appeals went to Sadr Nizamat Adalat.
- These courts followed both Hindu and Muslim laws.
- Cornwallis in 1793 brought the 'Cornwallis Code' based on the separation of power whereby he divested the collector of all his judicial powers and left him with the duty of revenue administration.
- Lord Cornwallis brought further changes and abolished diwani & faujdari Adalat and in its place he created district Adalat's (Jila Adalat) which entertained both civil and criminal cases.             
- He also created 4 - provincial court of Appeal(civil) and Circuit(criminal) at Dhaka, Murshidabad, Patna and Calcutta which entertain appeals from district court.
- Cornwallis started the appointed of Covenanted civil servants to decide th e cases in 4 - provincial courts of appeal and circuit. These European officers were supported by Hindu and Muslim law Expert like Qazi, Mufti and Pandit.
- He established the hierarchy of courts in India at different levels.
- **Hierarchy**: Munsif Court -\> Registrar Court -\> District Court( Zila Adalat) -\> 4 Courts of Circuit and appeal -\> Sadr Diwani & Sadr Nizamat. Supreme Court at Calcutta -\> King in council.
- Highest court: King in Council - But it entertained only those cases where the disputed amount was more than 5000 Rs.

- 1831: William Bentick abolished Four provincial courts of appeal and circuit and established judicial commissionaires and transferred the functions of abolished court to DM.

- In 1865 hierarchy was Munsif court -\> Registrar court -\> District court -\> Judicial commissionaires -\> 3 High courts: Bombay, Calcutta, Madras.
- The Supreme Court at Calcutta was fused with High Court at Calcutta.
- During the Reign of W. Bentick the law commission was setup under the chairmanship of Macauley. On the basis of Recommendation of this commission IPC 1860, CPC 1861(civil) were Enacted. Further recommendations led to establishment of 3 High courts in 1865 at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. 
### **Land Revenue Settlement under the British**
 _Permanent Settlement System(Zamindari Bandobast):_- In order to generate sufficient revenue for a longer period of time.
- It was introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1793.
- It was introduced in the province of Bihar and Bengal and Orissa.
- Later it was extended to Varanasi and the Northern districts of Madras.
- It covered 19 % of British Indian territory.
- The settlement was between the Zamindar and the British authorities.
- The Zamindars were entitled to land ownership.
- It was permanent, hereditary and transferrable.
- However, Company retained ultimate ownership and if Zamindar defaults on payment, the land could be sold or auctioned.
- The revenue was permanently fixed that 10/11 of the total revenue will be submitted to British authorities and zamindars can keep 1/11 of total revenue for themselves.
- The rate of taxes on peasants was at the discretion of the Zamindar and that were fixed arbitrarily.
- In the law, there was a provision of the agreement between peasants and Zamindars but was never exercised in person.
- Under the settlement there was a Sunset Clause:
    
    - The date of submission of revenue was pre-fixed.
    - Zamindars needed to submit the revenue before the sunset of the pre-fixed date.
    - If Zamindar was not able to submit the revenue on time, then the land ownership right was snatched from him.
- There was no provision for relief for peasants even in times of natural disasters and crop failures. 
**Reasons for implementation:**

- To generate sufficient revenue for longer period of time for bearing the administrative expense and the expansion of Indian territory at the minimum cost incurred in revenue collection.
- To create a new class of Zamindars who is a friendly and firm supporter of British rule. 
**Outcomes:**

- It gave a fixed permanent income for the British.
- But the Britishers were not allowed to increase land revenue before the fixed period.
- Though the majority of Zamindars reaped huge benefits, some of them lost their land ownership rights.
- It led to the rise of a large number of intermediaries, absentee landlords, and money lenders. 
**Effect on peasants:**

- Peasants are reduced to the status of hand-to-mouth existence.
- Moreover, they were also caught in a vicious cycle of debt.
- This happened because they had to take money from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates.
- There was widespread discontent among peasants which later fuelled many peasant revolts.
- It increased a large number of landless laborers.
- It led to the deterioration of the fertility of agricultural land as there was no investment from the side of the British and Zamindars on agricultural land.
- Peasants were not having the capacity to invest in the land. _RYOTWARI AND MAHALWARI SYSTEM_  

**RYOTWARI SYSTEM**

- Introduced in 1792 by Captain Reed with help of Thomas Munro in the Bara mahal region in Karnataka.
- In 1820, Munro introduced it in Madras Presidency and Elphinstone introduced it in the Bombay Presidency.
- It covered about 50% of the British Indian Territory.
- It was direct settlement between British authorities and Peasants. 
**Provisions**

- Land ownership rights were given to ryots and It was hereditary and transferable.
- Land revenue was directly negotiated with the peasants.
- Contrary to permanent settlement, the revenue rates were to be revised after an interval of 30 years.
- Ryots had to pay the revenue before a pre-fixed date and time - If not so, he was evicted from the land and British authorities can sell the land through the process of auctioning.
- For calculation and imposition of taxes, a comparative scientific method was adopted whereby the land was surveyed and classified. moreover the total expense of growing a crop was deducted before fixing the tax rate. It was also proposed in the law that after deducting the expense, the revenue rate cannot be fixed more than 50%, but in reality, it was not followed.
- There was the provision of relief to ryots in the situation of natural calamities or crop failures, but in reality, not given relief.
- British took the help of Polygars and Mirasidars in South India - to collect the revenue. 
**Reasons for implementation**

- As there is no provision of revision in the permanent settlement.
- As per utilitarian thought, land ownership right was to be retained to be with ryots so that they can spend their efforts and energy in maintaining the fertility of land.
- Due to the industrial revolution, there was a huge demand for raw material supplies from India. 
**Outcome**

- Increase in the British revenue, raw material supply to Britain.
- Led to increased administrative expense.
- Peasants were still exploited and marginalised by greedy officials and British agents etc.
- Moreover they were oppressed by moneylenders who charged high interest rates on loans.
- It did not eliminated village Elites like baramins, Polygars and Mirasidars, gradually positioned themselves comfortably in the subordinate ranks of the revenue establishments.
- Some of them brought lucrative & large tracks of irrigated land after getting their official appointment.
- Enhancement of power of elites resulted in cohesion, bribery and corruption by subordinate officials. it led to establishment of Madras torture commission, 1855, which maintained that there is a dire need of reform in the Ryotwari settlement. 
**Mahal Wari system**

- Mahal word means landed state, but in this settlement, it was recognized as a single economic entity which could be a group of one or more villages or a big landed state of landlords.
- It was implemented in 30% area of British India.
- In 1819, Holt Mackenzie gave the suggestion to implement as such in 1822 it was introduced in western U.P.
- In 1833, Martin Bird extended it to the rest of North India.
- The landownership right was retained with hereditary landowners, be it big landlords or common peasantry.
- It was hereditary and transferrable.
- For revenue collection, the Mahal unit was created and an agreement was signed with the village headman talukdaar, thikadaars and Lambardar.
- Non-payment of the revenue on time led to eviction from the land.
- For the first time, a map was used and a land record was maintained in the register, also there was provisions to conduct field to field surveys for revenue assessments. 
**Outcomes**

- The revenue rates were exorbitant and highly oppressive as such no economic benefit was trickling down to small and middle peasantry.
- The survey which was the core of new arrangement failed because it was too complex to be carried out with the existing Machinery. The obvious Result was over assessment based on idiosyncratic estimates.
- Commercialization of agriculture started to happen at a rapid pace in mahalwari concerned areas.
- Moreover, it was very much observed that land became a commodity that could be sold and mortgaged.
- The Agricultural depression, 1828 worsened the situation, with the Rising debt burden peasants started to sell their land like a commodity. In other words it led to the increased pace of commodification of land.
- The grievances of the rural society at North India war soon to be expressed rather loudly and violently in the revolt of 1857.

# REVOLT OF 1857

**Causes**

- The causes are so inextricably woven together, that it was difficult to determine the sequence in which they arose.
- There was a fateful combination of the circumstances.
- Which didn’t appear in the past and not tended to reoccur. 
### Military reasons

- British authority decided to replace the old Brown Bess musket with the ==new Enfield rifles.==
- The new riffle was chosen for its longer range and greater accuracy.
- In this new riffle sepoys needed to bite off a paper from the ==cartridge== before loading it.
- It was alleged that the paper was smeared with ==cow and pig fat,== which provoked Hindus and Muslim sepoys' religious sentiments.
- They forged a united resistance against the British.
- It made it obligatory that sepoys go on duty wherever ordered then it led to sepoys suspecting that Britishers were trying to ==convert== their religion to Christianity.
- On a professional level, an Indian sepoy was paid ==1/3rd of salary== as compared to a European sepoy.
- Moreover, there was ==racial discrimination== in the matters of promotion, and Indian sepoys were treated roughly abused, and humiliated.
- In ==1854, the post office act== was enacted which withdrew all the postage privileges of the sepoys.
- The majority of the recruits in the British army were from Bengal, Awadh, and northwest frontier province where caste consolidation was deeper.
- The high cast brahmins, Rajput’s and Pathans didn’t like to be treated on par with lower caste recruits and they were disaffected with this.
- Initially, soldiers were paid ==Bhatta==/ allowance when they were posted far from their home by 1850 it was also withdrawn.
- By the 1850s British army faced reverses in Afghanistan and premium;
- which generated a feeling that the British are not invincible. 
### Economic causes

- Various land revenue settlements like permanent, ryotwari, mahalwari by the British meant a loss of land for landholders and heavy taxation to cultivators.
- The tax rates under all the systems were heavy and oppressive.
- Moreover, it was collected even at the time of crop failure.
- In such situations, peasants took loans from the local Mahajan or moneylender who charged exorbitant interest rates, leading to peasants being caught in a vicious cycle of debt and commodification of land.
- The economic decline of the Indian peasantry was further reflected in 12 major and many minor famines between 1770 – 1857.

- The company traders enjoyed various privileges such as duty-free trade which made their products comparatively cheaper
- British policy also did not lead to fall of Indian industry in fact their policy was all about supporting the industrial revolution in Britain.

- 1850, the British government appointed a tribunal to look into titled deeds of states which were given rent-free status.
- The Inam commission pronounced confiscation of 21000 rent-free states.
- In this, the people who suffered the most were maulvis, ulemas, pandits who enjoyed a rent-free state for maintenance of religious service.
- They played a very active role in the revolt. 
### Socio-religious causes

- The British system in India was identified with a certain degree of social reform but it created ambivalence in the Indian society.
- Though some of the people favoured the reform majority was against it.
- They believed that the British had no business to interfere in the social affairs of India.
- Moreover, the bad faith of the British government further alienated the Indians, and always referred to them as bigots, barbaric and animalistic, etc.
- Moreover, they were also highly disaffected with the proselytizing activities of Christian missionaries.
- ==Religious disability act 1850== instilled among Hindu community whereby British were trying to alter many of the Hindu customs. 
### Political Causes

- The company has several annexations under ==Wellesley’s subsidiary alliance== and ==doctrine of lapse of Dalhousie.==
- The annexation of the kingdoms was carried with complete impunity.
- Awadh and Punjab have annexed in defence of treaty rights.
- Berar was snatched from Nizam of Hyderabad.
- Mughal emperor bahadur shah was left in a state of helplessness.
- Complete ill will and popular discontent was the residue of this whole cell swiping away of the native states. 
### The course of the revolt

- 2nd Feb 1857 : - the 19th native infantry of ==Berhampur== refused to use the grease cartridges as such it was disbanded.
- 29th of march 1857 :- in ==Barrackpore== in Calcutta the sepoys of 34th infantry refused to use the new rifle as such it was disbanded.
- Moreover, one young sepoy **mangal Pandey** went a step further and killed one of the European officers.
    
    - As such, he was overpowered and hanged
- Soon the mutiny started to spread to Ambala, Lucknow, and Awadh.
- The real outbreak is believed to be mutiny at Meerut.
- On the 23rd of April 1857, sepoys refused to use the greased cartridges.
    
    - As such, they were tried by a court-martial and sentenced to 10 years of hard labour on 9th May 1857.
    - They were stripped off of their uniform, fettered, and marched to jail.

- On 11th May, reaching Delhi they proclaimed Bahadur shah as emperor of Hindustan and by nightfall, all the European officers at Delhi were massacred. 
### IMPORTANT LEADERS

- Bahadur Shah was trying to restore/revive the old Mughal glory.
- Initially, he was hesitant to join but later he decided in favour of providing symbolic leadership or nominal leadership to the revolt.

- First Indian women congress president - Sarojini Naidu
- The first woman to address the congress session – Kadimbini Ganguly. (1898)**.** _Theory of safety valve_- As per the imperialist view, AO HUME was solely responsible for the creation of the Indian national congress to provide a safe outlet to ventilate the grievances of the rising middle class.
- Also to avert any major uprising or revolt.
- However, this view was not accepted by the nationalists.
- According to them, no single individual was responsible for the formation of INC and it was the result of early political organization and the early nationalist leaders
- All things considered, it can be said that if AO Hume was using INC as a safety valve, then the early nationalists were using them as a lightning conductor, in order to avoid official suspicion regarding their intention. _The first phase of Indian freedom struggle (1885- 1905) – Moderate phase_- In the beginning, the early nationalists demanded to increase the number of Indians in the legislative council and grant them more political rights.
- They also demanded reforms in Indian civil services so as Indians are not in a disadvantageous position as compared to Europeans.
- Creating political awareness among the masses and economic critique of colonialism.
- As far as the methods of early nationalists are concerned, they adopted methods of constitutional agitation, prayers, and petitions within the four walls of law. 
- They preferred peaceful agitation and never had faith in the capacity of the masses. 
- Though they didn't initiate mass struggle but, the political awareness created by them was facilitated by future mass struggle by the people. _The second phase of freedom struggle (1905-1915)_- In 1905, the British authority decided to divide the province of Bengal into two parts i.e., east Bengal with a Muslim majority population including present-day Bangladesh.
- Assam and West Bengal with the Hindu majority population including Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.
- With the announcement of this decision, the Indian national movement entered into the second phase.
- The partition was affected on the 16th of October 1905.
- At this point in time, the extremists' leaders of the congress were of the view that prayers and petitions must be backed with passive resistance.
- The greatest representative of this thought was Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
- Tilak preached his militant ideas through his newspaper - Mahratta in English and Kesari in Marathi.
- He also started to celebrate the Ganpati festival in 1893 and the Shivaji festival in 1895 to increase his popularity.
- He gave provocative speeches against the British.
- He was supported by the nationalist like Lala Lajpat Rai, Bipin Chander pal, and Aurobindo Ghosh.

- VO Chidambaram Pillai founded the steam navigation company of India. 
- It could not garner the support of Muslim masses in Bengal due to two important reasons.
- Divide and rule policy followed by British authorities and reactionary leadership among the Muslim masses.

- In 1906, Agha Khan and nawab Salim Ullah of Dacca founded AIML with the support of then viceroy Minto.
- They made their agenda very clear that this organization will work in favour of Muslims and create a political organization in the interest of the Muslim masses.
