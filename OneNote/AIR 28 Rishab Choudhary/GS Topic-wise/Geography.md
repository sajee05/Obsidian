||- Role of geographical factors in shaping Ancient History<br>    <br>    - Indus and Ganges River Systems : facilitated growth of early civilizations like the Harappan and Vedic societies.<br>        <br>        - IVC cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.<br>    - Fertile Soils : supported extensive agriculture leading to surplus production<br>        <br>        - Example: The Mauryan Empire, with its capital at Pataliputra, flourished.<br>    - The Himalaya : acted as natural barrier protecting from invasions and ensuring political stability<br>    - Deccan Plateau : provided rich mineral resources and arable land for southern kingdoms<br>    - Monsoon winds provided reliable rainfall for agriculture<br>    - Extensive coastlines enabled the development of ports and trade networks<br>        <br>        - Lothal used for trade between IVC with Mesopotamia<br>        - Muziris for trade with Romans<br>    - Mountain passes : facilitated trade and cultural exchanges<br>        <br>        - The Silk Road connected India with world|

||- What make fjords picturesque<br>    <br>    - Dramatic landscape : stark contrast between steep cliffs and fjords create awe and grandeur.<br>    - Crystal clear water<br>    - Waterfalls<br>    - Lush vegetation<br>    - Support diverse ecosystems and abundant wildlife<br>    - Recreational activities like kayaking, hiking and cruising|
