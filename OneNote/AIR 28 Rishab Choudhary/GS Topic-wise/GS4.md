|Essence|- The essence of ethics is about understanding the core principles and qualities that underpins ethical behaviour and decision-making.<br>- It goes beyond simple set of rules or commands and answers fundamental questions like ==why and how of living a good and meaningful life.==<br>  <br>- Key aspects of the essence of ethics<br>    <br>    - Universal ==values== : At its core, ethics revolves around universal values like justice, fairness, honesty, respect, compassion, and responsibility.<br>    - Internal reflection : accessing our core values, learning from mistakes and adopting to broader social changes.<br>    - ==Intention== : having right intentions that aligns ones action and values.<br>    - ==Critical thinking== : questioning dogma and social norms. Challenging status quo and unjust practices.<br>    - Social impact : ethical decisions have ripple effects on individuals, communities and society at large.|

|### Conscience|- Conscience is inner sense of right or wrong<br>- Conscience is inner sense or faculty. It gives us sense of what is right or wrong.<br>    <br>    - ==E.g. Justice HR Khanna's dissenting judgement in ADM Jabalpur==<br>  <br>- Advantages of conscientious decision making<br>    <br>    - Questions unjust laws<br>        <br>        - R==osa Park== defiance against racial segregation in Montgomery<br>    - Impose an obligation to be moral even in absence of laws<br>        <br>        - Ethical ==AI== and Biotechnology<br>        - E.g. Edward Snowden - whistleblowing of espionage on civilians<br>    - Specific to individual<br>        <br>        - Provides moral guidance in ethical dilemmas which occurs in unique situations and circumstances<br>        - E.g. Doctor refusing to perform unnecessary surgery prescribed by hospital<br>    - Conscience can adapt and evolve alongside societal norms and personal growth<br>        <br>        - Laws can be outdated<br>        - E.g. Section 377 IPC<br>    - Not ethically correct to act on doubtful conscience<br>        <br>        - A doubtful law does not binds<br>        - E.g. leaking sensitive information by civil servant for transparency<br>  <br>- Limitations<br>    <br>    - Subjectivity : May be certain, doubtful, probable<br>        <br>        - can lead to inconsistencies and potential harm<br>        - E.g. caste/religion based discrimination<br>    - Prone to manipulation<br>        <br>        - propaganda and social pressure can manipulate individual consciences<br>        - E.g. Hitler's propaganda<br>    - Conscience lacks external enforcement mechanisms<br>        <br>        - No sanctions for unconscientious acts<br>        - E.g. underpaying workers by corporates<br>    - Unequal application : education, reflection, and exposure to diverse perspectives makes person more conscientious<br>        <br>        - E.g. someone in corrupt environment may not see an issue in taking bribes<br>  <br>- ==Crisis of conscience== is a internal conflict which arises when individuals core moral principles clash with their obligation.<br>    <br>    - It's a struggle between what you know is right and what is convenient, tempting, or expected.<br>        <br>        - E.g. IPS officer monitoring peaceful protests, was ordered to take strict action.<br>- Incidence from personal life<br>    <br>    - I was working on developing an application in my company. I discovered that the application has critical security flaws that may threaten the security of lakhs of users. My colleague insisted on finishing the project on the deadline regardless of the risk. This situation presents a crisis of conscience where I have to make a decision on releasing the application with security risk or raising the concern to higher-ups and refusing to release, which may cause a delay or even financial loss.<br>    <br>    - How I resolved this?<br>        <br>        - I raised the concern with my manager. He assured me not to worry of any retaliation and ensure that the security flaws are fixed before releasing.<br>          <br>        <br>- **How does it manifest in public domain?**<br>    <br>    - For public servant<br>        <br>        - Compassion v/s rules<br>            <br>            - Helping citizens in distress bypassing rules<br>            - Crisis situation<br>        - Ethical v/s legal<br>            <br>            - Whistleblowing<br>        - Integrity v/s following orders<br>            <br>            - Verbal orders of senior<br>    - For institutions<br>        <br>        - Environment v/s development<br>        - Substantive equality v/s formal equality<br>            <br>            - Affirmative action?<br>        - National security v/s freedom of speech and privacy<br>        - Development v/s community rights<br>          <br>        <br>- **How to resolve COC**<br>    <br>    - Recognize<br>    - Analyze<br>        <br>        - Self reflection and critical thinking<br>    - Seeking clarity : asking orders in writing<br>    - Consulting trusted people<br>        <br>        - Having diverse perspective helps in decision making<br>    - Prioritize values<br>        <br>        - Reflect to your core values and take decisions accordingly<br>    - Be prepared for consequences<br>        <br>        - Be responsible for decisions and face the consequence with integrity and courage.<br>          <br>        <br>- **What acts as guiding values?**<br>    <br>    - Gandhi's Talisman<br>    - Emotional intelligence<br>    - Critical thinking<br>    - Moral reasoning<br>    - Having strong ethical foundation<br>      <br>    <br>- Neither conscience nor laws and regulations are foolproof guides to ethical decision-making. Ultimately, the most reliable approach likely lies in a balanced combination of both.|
