|# **Dharma Chakra Pravartana**|- The Buddha’s first sermon is called Dharma Chakra Pravartana or the Turning of the Wheel of Law.<br>- In the beginning he spoke of his search for the reasons of human sorrow or ‘dukkha’ as he called it.<br>- Why do we suffer pain and are filled with dissatisfaction?<br>    <br>    - He said the ==cause of our sorrow was our cravings and desires.== He called them ‘tanha’ and explained the Four Noble Truths:<br>        <br>        - “The world is full of misery and suffering. (_dukkha_)<br>        - The cause of this sorrow is desire and attachment.(_taṇhā_)<br>        - This suffering will cease when we extinguish desire.(_nirodha_)<br>        - The path to end sorrow is through following the Noble Eightfold Path.”(_Magga_)<br>- The Noble Eight Fold Path (**अरिय** **अट्ठङ्गिक** **मग्ग**), as the Buddha explained it, was a simple, ethical way of life that we could all follow.<br>- As the Buddha explained it:<br>    <br>    **DS** **VKA** **VSS**<br>    <br>    2. Right view (_samyak-dṛṣṭi_ / _sammā-diṭṭhi_) or "right understanding"<br>    3. Right Resolve (_samyak-saṃkalpa_ / _sammā-saṅkappa_) can also be known as "right thought".<br>    4. Right speech (_samyag-vāc_ / _sammā-vācā_)<br>    5. Right action (_samyak-karmānta_ / _sammā-kammanta_) <br>    6. Right livelihood (_samyag-ājīva_ / _sammā-ājīva_) <br>    7. Right effort (_samyag-vyāyāma_ / _sammā-vāyāma_)<br>    8. Right Mindfulness (_sammā-sati)_<br>    9. Right Concentration (_samyak-samādhi_ / _sammā-samādhi_)<br>      <br>    <br>- At its heart the path is about leading a humane and moral life. The Buddha did not talk of magic or miracles. He did not ask his followers to perform expensive religious rituals or obey the priesthood.<br>  <br>- He did not claim to have any supernatural powers or to have heard the message of a supreme being. He said simply, our salvation is in our own actions and that we will gain peace if we live the right way.<br>  <br>- The Eight Fold Path is easy to understand but not that easy to follow in our daily lives. It is a spiritual challenge that can take a lifetime of meditation and thought. You learn something new every time you think about it.<br><br>“What is the Noble Eight Fold Path which leads to the end of suffering?|
