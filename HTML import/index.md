Art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination  
like painting, sculpture, music, dance, architecture

  

- There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and  
    across cultures. The three classical branches of visual art [are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting) [painting,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture) [sculpture, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture) architecture.
    
- Theatre[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance) dance, and other [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts)[performing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts) arts, a[s well as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature) literature[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music) music[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) film [and other media such as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_media) [interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_media) media[, are  
    included in a broader definition of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts) [the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts) arts.
    
- Until the 17th century, _art_ [referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft) crafts [or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciences) sciences.
    
- In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the  [fine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art) arts are separated and  
    [distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_arts) [decorative or applied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts) arts.
    
- [The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic_interpretation) interpretation[, are explored in a branch of philosophy known  
    as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics) aesthetics[. The resulting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artworks) artworks [are studied in the professional fields of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_criticism) art criticism [and the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_history) history of art.
    
      
    
    Culture is the customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of group  
    of people regarded collectively
    
- **Culture** [is an umbrella term which encompasses the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior) [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior) behaviours[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution) institutions[, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm) norms [found in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society) societies[, as  
    well as the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) knowledge[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief) beliefs[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art) arts[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law) laws[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm) customs[, capabilities, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) habits of the individuals in these groups.
    
- Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location.
    
- [Humans acquire culture through the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning) learning [processes of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enculturation) enculturation [and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization) socialization, which is shown by the diversity of  
    cultures across societies.
    
    [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_norm) cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behaviour, dress, language, and demeanour  
    in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.
    
- [Thus in military culture,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage) valour [is counted a typical behaviour for an individual and duty, honour, and loyalty to the social  
    group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_of_conflict) [continuum of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_of_conflict) conflict.
    
- In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.
    
    [Cultural change, or repositioning, is the reconstruction of a cultural concept of a society. Cultures are internally affected by  
    both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies.  
    Organizations like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) UNESCO attempt to preserve culture and cultural heritage.

    Reasons for the decline of Buddhism
    
    - Once Buddha said to his brother Anand that if women are allowed into sangha Buddhism which going to survive for more  
        than 1000 years will vanish within 100 years, later his words proved to be true.
        
    - The monks became corrupt and they started to lead a luxurious life.
        
    - They abandoned the language of people Pali and started to use a difficult language of elites i.e. Sanskrit.
        
    - The monks started to interfere in the political affairs of the kingdom after which many kings stopped the patronization of  
        Buddhism.
        
    - The sectarian divisions in Buddhism further weakened its propagation and led to its dilution.
        
    - There were further reforms in Hinduism which reattracted many people back into the fold of Hinduism.
        
    - For example, In the Gupta period Bhakti or devotion was highly emphasized and animal sacrifice was discouraged.
        
    - The compilation of Hindu religious literature and the beginning of temple art further consolidated the growth of Hinduism.
        
    - A Large number of Buddhist followers came back into the Hindu fold.
        
    - In Puranas it was propagated that Buddha was the 9th reincarnation of Vishnu which led to the assimilation of Buddhism  
        into Hinduism.
        
    - The high missionary zeal displayed by the Buddhists worked against them and a large number of people in society started  
        to detach from Buddhism.

            individual souls (Jivas). Brahman is the supreme, independent reality, while individual souls are  
            dependent on Brahman and are eternally separate from it.

            devoid of any multiplicity or distinctions. The individual self (Atman) is ultimately identical with  
            Brahman, and the apparent diversity of the world is considered an illusion (Maya). Advaita emphasizes
            
            the path of knowledge (Jnana) and meditation (Dhyana) to realize the non-dual nature of reality and attain  
            liberation
