    ![WESTERt TURKS m GSA s ANZY SLCHONS EMPIRE TOCHARIA...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044429-14.png) - Mauryan empire mainly declined because of internal strife while the Guptas faced external threats which led to their decline.
- External trade and commerce were more during the Mauryan dynasty compared to the Gupta dynasty.
- Mauryas were great builders, for example, architectural structures such as stupas and pillars flourished during Mauryan rule whereas Science, Astronomy, and Literature flourished during the Gupta period.
- Mauryan rulers patronaged many religions whereas ==Guptas followed and promoted Vaishnavism.==
- The taxation system during the Mauryan rule was more stringent. Guptas favoured a liberal tax system.
- Mauryans followed a more centralised administrative structure with the help of a well developed bureaucratic system. In the ==Gupta== empire, ==bureaucracy was not as elaborate== as in Mauryas and many feudatories emerged in the Gupta administration.
- The Mauryan empire was much larger compared to the Gupta empire.

### Mauryas Vs Guptas
 - Guptas showed an overall policy of religious tolerance.
- Idol worship became a common phenomenon in temples.
- History was presented as a cycle of 10 incarnations of Vishnu.
- Vaishnavism believed in Bhakti and non-violence which attracted many foreigners and many tribes.
- Vishnu became the most important God along with Brahma and Shiva.
- Bhagvatism(also called Vaishnavism) emerged as the most important Bhakti traditions. 
**Religion:**
 - ==Niyog== which was allowed earlier in the Vedic period was ==not allowed== in the Gupta period. Under this practice, a younger brother could marry the wife of an older brother in the eventuality of the death of the older brother.
- The ==first example== of the immolation of a widow(sati) is found during the Gupta period. However, some books also talk about widow remarriage.
- The position of women declined while women of lower classes were free to earn their livelihood, the same did not happen to women of upper classes. 
- The number of Chandals increased. **Fa-Hein** writes about their deplorable condition. They lived outside the city and dealt mainly in the trade of meat. Whenever they entered the town, they struck a piece of wood to announce their arrival.
- The position of Shudra improved. They were represented as agriculturalists.
- Warriors of foreigners and tribal chiefs were given the status of Kshatriyas.

- The nature of landholding was also different. For example, one of the important landholdings was **Bhumichchi-Dranyaya**==(भूमिछि द्रणयाए====)==. Here ownership was given to a person who made a ==barren land cultivable==.
- The land was divided into many categories such as Kshetra(cultivable land), Khila(wasteland), Aprahata(अप्राहत)(forest area), Vasti(habitable land) and Gapata Saraha(गपता सराह)(pastoral land)**.**
- Long-distance trade had declined, however, inland trade was prosperous.
- These coins often portrayed kings' love for war and art. Silver coins were also issued, however, few copper coins were issued.
- Guptas issued the largest number of Gold coins called **Dinaras****.**

**Economy:**
 - We find elements of feudalism in the Gupta administration. For example, a major part of the empire was held by feudatory chiefs, higher officials were paid in cash, however, some were also given land grants. Religious functionaries were granted land free of tax. They were also authorised to collect taxes and punish criminals.
- These guilds enjoyed certain immunities, for example, they were governed by their own laws.
- Shrenis were associations of traders, merchants and artisans. This system of Guild began in the Mahajanapada period and continued throughout the Mauryan period. Generally, a separate Shreni existed for a particular group of persons engaged in the same vocation.
