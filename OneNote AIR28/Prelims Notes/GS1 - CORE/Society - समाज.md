**Questions:** **While on one hand urbanization is creating the potential for social integration and economic development, on the other hand, it is leading to socio-economic exclusion. Explain the paradox. (150 words/ 10 marks)**
 - Loss of human capital. 
- Marginal man. 
- Cognitive development of people.
- Lack of trust between migrants and natives.
- The vicious cycle of poverty.
- Social stratification.
- Quality of life.
- The disintegration of joint families: 
    
    - Lack of primary socialization.
    - Lack of social control.
    - Would lead to Increase in juvenile delinquency. 
- The proliferation of slums: 
    
    - Isolated areas.
    - High probability of pathological behaviour. 
    - Lack of resilience wrt financial, natural disasters.
- Degradation of value system: aggravated the abuse against marginalized sections.
- Relative deprivation due to unequal access to resources leads to crime. 
- Residential segregation based on primordial identities ==(caste, class, religion, ethnicity)== leads to a spatial pattern of communal violence.  
**Socio-cultural problems:**
 - Transportation: inadequate road infrastructure and inefficient public transportation systems lead to capacity overloading and problems like road accidents, traffic jams, etc.
- The problems range from poor management of water resources, leaky distribution networks, and the vast volume of untreated wastewater being dumped in Indian rivers.
- According to ==WWF, by 2050, at least 30 Indian cities will fa==ce major water risks.
- According to World Air Quality Report by IQ Air, 10 out of 15 polluted cities are in India. 
- Rapid urbanization has caused environmental degradation as congestion of people in limited space reduces the quality of air and contaminates water.
- The problem of waste generation and waste management.

**Physical infrastructure:**
 - Provide affordable housing.
- Capacity building in urban local bodies.

- It contributes to the labour force as the majority of the informal economy is thriving in slums. 
- Hence constitute a ==major vote bank.==
- They are the most politically active section of society. 

**Slums are persisting due to:** 
 - Although slums were perceived to be a temporary problem, however, it has now become a permanent structural problem. **Why?** - Corruption, laxity on part of the administration, political will, etc.
- It will lead to unaffordable housing.
- The problem of gated communities: 
- Failure to implement the National Urban Housing and Habitat Policy, according to which 15% of the land is to be allocated every year for social housing.
- Lack of integrated planning. The entire focus is on land use, without taking into consideration, environmental aspects, transportation, and socio-economic needs.
- Lack of private developers w.r.t. housing for the poor.
- Improper city planning due to heritage of past constructions. 

**Problems with respect to housing:**
 - However, according to an expert group on urban poverty and slums, it results from th==e failure of housing policies.==
- A general perception was that slums were proliferating due to migration.
- World Bank(In 2018) states that 35.2% of the urban population lives in slums.  #remember-for-later
- Slums were proliferation due to rapid migration. 
- Slums are urban residential dwellings that are unfit for human habitation, as it is dilapidated, poorly ventilated, and unclean. Lack essential resources required for basic living For example WASH (Drinking water, Sanitation,  Hygiene)

**Slums:**
 - Mushrooming farmhouse culture. 
- It is re==ferred to as a social and demographic process w==here the population moves back from urban to rural areas due to inner city deprivation, overcrowding, and pollution.

    - Use of media for spreading awareness.
    - Focus on research in reproductive biology and contraception.
    - Population efforts were criticised by M S Swaminathan who gave the following recommendations: 
- **1978**:
- **1961-71**: - three below approaches
    
    - Extension approach: Generating awareness w.r.to benefits of a small family.
    - Cafeteria approach: Awareness/availability of different methods of family planning but the ultimate choice is with people.
    - Selective approach :- targeted intervention for couples b/w age group 25-35 
- **1952:** National Family Planning Program.
    
    - Clinical approach: Infrastructural supports will be provided to the couples who are positively disposed towards the idea of family planning.
- **1951-61:**
    
    - Period of experimentation
- **1947-51:**
    
    - Period of neutrality.
- **Pre-independence:**
    
    - Period of indifference. _Evolution:_- **Types**:
    
    - Ante-natal
    - Distributional
      
    
- **Concept****:**
    
    - Purposeful measures aim to affect demographic processes such as fertility, mortality, migration, etc. 
### Population policy
 
**Que: To what extent does migration create the opportunity for social mobility. Discuss (10 marks/150 words)**
 - Sensitize and train policymakers, local government officials, employers, and financial institutions regarding the obstacles faced by migrants in accessing public services.
- Establish **migrant labour cells** in each state so as to ensure their rights are secured.
- Inter-state and inter-district coordination committees to trace the movement of migrants.
- Mapping of migrant workers so as to collect credible data for effective policy making.
- The politicization of the issue of migration needs to be checked.
- Developing source regions in order to address the issues of rapid and skewed migration.
- Active participation of NGOs and civil society to drive away the mistrust between natives and migrants.
- Providing skills to the migrant workers to increase their desirability in the labour market.
- Judicial implementation of existing legislative measures.
_Way forward:_  

- Interstate migrants workmen Act.
- Unorganized Sector Worker Act.
- Code of Social Security, 2020. - For **employment**:
    
    - PM Garib Kalyan Yojana.
 
- For **Food safety:**
    
    - ==One Nation one Ration card.==
- For **health**:
    
    - The benefits under ==Ayushman Bharat== are made portable across the country.
 - **Negatives**:
    
    - Lack of job stability.
    - Mostly confined to the informal sector --\> lack of minimum wage, lack of social security benefits, more vulnerable to exploitation, etc.
    - In the absence of documentation, the problem gets aggravated.
    - Mostly **seasonal migrants** (139 million -\> Economic survey-2017).
        
        - Problem of education of child of seasonal migrants (80% of child's of seasonal migrants don't have access to schools)
        - Lack of portability of benefits - (_one nation one ration card policy)_
        - Reduce the ==status to ghost citizens==
    - Victim of identity politics
    - Issue of marginal man.
    - Problem of housing/sanitization and poor health.
    - Intergenerational transmission of poverty.
- **Positives**:
    
    - Access to better infrastructure with respect to health, education, skills, etc.
    - Probability of Human capital formation.
    - Potential for ==women empowerment es==pecially when the destination is urban areas.
    - ==Social capital formation.(==समाज शशक्ति करण, mutual trust, opportunities, PR which are creating economic outcomes)
    - Social innovation. (in centre of urbanism)
    - Ability to escape the trap of social pathologies (E.g.: Caste, patriarchy, racism, etc).
      
    
_Consequences for Migrants:_  

- ==Lack of trust b==etween migrants and locals as migrants are preferred to take away the opportunity meant for locals.
- Probability of identity politics (example of शिव सेना and rise of labour parties) --\> ==Son of the Soil theory.==
- The proliferation of slums (due to over-urbanization).
- Increase incidences of crimes due to feelings of r==elative deprivation==.
- ==Ghettoization== is based on primordial identities due to a lack of cultural migration.
- Skewed sex ratio in case of Male-specific migration.
- Failure of state administration with respect to good governance due to rising in population pressure.
- Creates potential for economic growth(availability of working age population).
- The rise in social tolerance.
- ==Cosmopolitan culture.==
- Unity in Diversity.
 - **Political:**
    
    - The decline in political participation.
    - Even the political leaders also diffuse their responsibility.
    - It does create the potential for efficient delivery of services --\> Good governance.
- **Socio-cultural:**
    
    - Migrants act as an agent of social change.
    - New ideas get diffused.
    - **E.g.**: W.r.to family planning, girl education, etc.
    - Progressive value system.
    - The absence of adult males for a long time might lead to the dislocation/disruption of the family.
    - Increase in the incidences of violence against women and children.
    - Emergence of female headed households.
- **Demographic:**
    
    - Feminization of workforce.
    - Increase in the dependent population.(15\<\>60)
    - Decrease in birth rate (Male-specific distress migration).
    - Increase the probability of child labour.
- **Economic**:
    
    - Loss of human resources.
    - It creates the opportunity for the government in the source areas to invest limited resources to ensure the development of the remaining population.
    - Benefits of remittances.
    - If migration is of surplus population, then it is a win-win situation.

**Source Region:**

_Consequences for region:_  
- **Place of destination:**
    
    - Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, etc.
- **Place of origin**:
    
    - U.P, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, etc.
- **Types of internal migration**:
    
    - Rural to Rural (R to R) = **62%** #remember-for-later
    - Rural to Urban (R-U) = **20%**
    - Urban to Urban (U-U) =**13%**
    - Urban to Rural (U-R) = **5%**
- **Statistics****:**
    
    - **450 million** (internal migrants)
    - Constitutes **37%** of Indian population are migrants.
    - Out of ==this,== **68%** ==of migrants are wo==men which is the feminization of migration.

    - I)Internal
    - ii)international
- Based on duration-
- **Types-** - According to the census, a person residing in a place other than the place of birth or has changed their usual place of residence is referred to as a migrant
- **Statistics****-**
- It refers to geographical mobility from one region to another involving change in residents for a considerable period of time

    - The ==quality== of the workforce
    - Job ==opportunities==
- The bulge in the working age group is only a necessary condition but doesn't guarantee economic growth
- DD is the Economic growth potential created due to the rise in the working-age population 
- Population bulge in working for age group i.e. 15-59 years which is expected to peak in 2036 (65% of the population in 15-59 years)

**Overview:-**
 
# Population and Associated Issues
 
- It was considered an act of ==Judiciopapism==
- Diversity is confused with discrimination that is different religious shrines have different religious customs so what is being observed is restriction and not discrimination
- There existed a historic origin of the restriction 
- In a plural society like India, entertaining PILs challenging various practices can cause a threat to the secular fabric of the country
 - FRs are meant for individuals not for idols
- Prohibition is not an ERP and hence not protected u/a 25
- The constitution is not a static document and the ambit of provisions can be widened as society evolves
- **The** **doctrine of the living tree****-** - _What are the matters that required a reservation of constitutional bench?_
    
    1. ==Restricting== the women based on biological factors amount for discrimination or not?
    2. Restricting such women(in mensural period) comes unde==r essential religious practices== under Article 25 or not?
    
    - banning the entry is derogatory to her dignity
    - ==Patriarchy== in religion can not supersede the freedom to practice religion 
    - Any exclusion on the basis of physiological factors is unconstitutional 
    - The prohibition was a form of practicing untouchability
- Women were allowed entry into the temple by the court
- With respect to this issue, there were two sets of arguments-
_Sabarimala_  
- However few sections in society have questioned the act on the following grounds-
- It serves the purpose of stringent law, aims to bring about ==gender justice,== provides redressal to women act as a source of deterrence, not an essential religious practice hence state can intervene

**Analysis-**
 - The magistrate can grant bail after hearing the wife
- Provision of allowance and custody of the child
- There is a provision of reconciliation without Nikal Halala if both the parties stop legal proceedings
- It is cognizable when women file a complaint or any related by blood
- Talaq-e-biddat is declared null and void it is considered as criminal offence with 3 years of jail and fine
_Triple Talaq_  
- The court should not whether the practice is ERP or not, in case it does it is an act of Judiciopapism
- However, SC put a stay and said HC made an error in interpreting Jain practice and Jain scholars were not consulted by HC
- It was equated with suicide and was considered not to be an essential religious practice
- Court banned Santhara a right to life doesn't include the right to die 
- PIL was filed by Nikhil Soni in Rajasthan HC
- Voluntarily giving up food and water so as to end life
_Santhara_  
- The court said they will determine what constitutes the essential practice
- The term religion covers all rituals, practices even dressing
- This doctrine is to protect those practices which  are essential and integral to the religion
- The ==doctrine of essentiality== evolved in the 1954 Shirur Mutt case 
### Essential religious practices vs Judiciopapism
 
**Que. Discuss the possible factors which are inhibiting the implementation of UCC in India.**  
**Que. UCC is much needed for India to progress in the 21st century. Critically analyse the statement.** 
 - **Way Forward****-**
    
    - Instead of implementing UCC in one single step foot in the door technique should be used
    - Persuading respective religious leaders to create awareness among the people wrt what constitutes UCC 
    - Educating the masses through social media
    - Prepare a draft for UCC while preparing all the stakeholders to need to be involved and once prepared it should be put on the public platforms for deliberations, discussion, and debates
    - Till the time a popular consensus is built state can continue to bring reforms in personal laws of different religions 
    - **For Example****-**
        
        - ==Abolition of triple talaq,== ==adoption== of ==laws== under the ==juvenile justice act==
        - At the same time NGOs, Civil Societies as well as cultural platforms should strive to drive away the mistrust between different religious communities - **Concluding Remark****-**
    
    - Democracies can be established in those countries which are multicultural however efforts should be made to end the cultural exclusion, development of complementary identities, and promotion of unity in diversity
    - National cohesion doesn't require the imposition of common identity but accommodation of diversity
    - Hence, any decision wrt UCC should be on the basis of popular consensus
- **Against-**
    
    - Lack of a blueprint
    - Apprehensions among minorities
    - lack of political will due to the sensitive nature of topics
    - Aggravate the religious conflict which will threaten the social/secular fabric of India.
    - Dilute essence of 'salad bowl theory' of multiculturalism.
    - Tendency of religious chauvinism.
    - Lack of responsible use of social media.
    - Lack of among people wrt UCC.
        
        - For e.g. instead of using it as a tool for empowerment, uniformity, progressive laws, it is seen from the prism of religious differences.
          
        
- **For-**
    
    - Women empowerment
    - uniformity in personal laws
    - Reduce the legal burden
    - End to vote bank politics
    - National cohesion
    - Progressive laws
    - Promote scientific temperament

## Secularism
 ![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044840-31.png)- Diversity in Unity = e.g. Patriarchy, marriage, patriotism, etc.
- **Bonds of Unity in India -** Geographical, regional, socio-cultural, Miscellaneous, 
    
    - **Geographical =** the first bond of unity is found in geopolitical integration, India is known for its geographical unity with the Himalayas in the north and Ocean on the side, amidst this Geographical unity we stand politically united, for e.g. Single constitution, single citizenship, all of us are governed by same political culture.
    - Temple Culture, places of worship and shrines plays a significant part in promoting interaction and cultural affinity among people, living in different parts of India, hence it is a source of unity which is reflected in the network of sacred places and shrines
    - **Regional Bond of Unity =** Horizontal bond of unity based on caste, and vertical unity on the bases of a common language.
    ![upl 24](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044832-29.png)  
    - **Cultural Bond of Unity =** Teaching of the religious scriptures, earning religious merits by visiting religious shrines
    ![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044834-30.png)  
    - **Language =** amidst linguistic diversity Hindi and English (Hinglish) act as a unifying thread, and even Sanskrit also acts as a bridge language.
    - **Miscellaneous Examples** = Festivals, Cuisines, cinema, All India Services, Educational Institutions, workplace, defence forces, tourism, patriotism, parliament, social media, nationalism, art forms, etc.
      
    
- **Meaning of Unity =** a sense of oneness that binds people together on the basis of uniformity and differences.

### Unity in Diversity:
 - **Ethnonationalism** based its legitimacy on language, religion, shared historical experiences, etc. to include or exclude people from the nation. 
**Question - Linguistic regional rather than religious identities have been the basis of ethnonationalism in India. Discuss?**
 - **Sanjib Baruah wrote in 'India against itself'** **Assam and its politics of nationalism**- he discussed the reasons for the emergence of demand for BODOLAND. - The increased presence of Bengali youth in govt jobs, Illegal migration from Bangladesh (displacement of traditional agriculture workers), Outnumbering of  native tribes in the electoral rolls by outsiders.
- **According to** **Ericson** ==Ethnic groups are defined as, those who consider themselves culturally distinct and such groups may exist in hierarchical order in society.== ![VISIONIA ubc q dokd](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044830-28.png)- People of an ethnic group have awareness of their similarities and how they are distinct from others which leads to the development of Ethnic identity, differential access to resources based on ethnic identity which leads to ==ethnic stratification -\> Ethnic antagonism -\> with the subjective realization of objective reality== leads to Ethno-nationalism.
- **Ethnic Group =** is defined as a social group consisting of people united by ties of common history, ancestry, common culture, etc.
_Ethno-Nationalism:_  

**Question - In the backdrop of growing incidences of racial intolerance briefly discuss its implication in the context of Indian society? (10 marks)**
 - **Bezbaruah Committee Recommendations:**
    
    - Stringent laws are the need of the hour.
    - Establishment ==of fast track courts== for speedy disposal of cases.
    - An ==educational== intervention to bring about change in the attitude wrt minorities.
    - Making use of social media to create awareness in the society. 
    - Provide legal awareness to racial minorities wrt a grievance redressal mechanism.
    - Bonding power over sports should be explored.
    - Confidence-building measures should be taken to assure racial minorities about their security and well-being in India.
- **Way Forward =**
    
    - There should be a sensitization program that focuses on India's Obsession with a particular race.(to spread awareness regarding the racial discrimination and it’s ill effect)
    - Charismatic personalities should come forward to voice against the practice of racism,
    - Police seeds to be trained and sensitized wrt racial attacks
    - Educational institutions need to be more accommodative and inclusive, 
    - Holding workshops by the govt or civil society to sensitize locals about the culture of racial minorities
    - Different agencies of socialization should inculcate neutral values, and compassion, towards racial minorities.
      
     - **Implication** - **Causes of Racial Intolerance**
- **The concept of Race =** is defined as a social group consisting of people having distinct physical traits, for e.g. skin colour, facial features, etc. 
### Racial Intolerance:
 
# Society Class 10
 
**Regionalism** is likely to happen in India because it is rooted in India's diversity, per se it is not a threat to India's Unity and integration. It becomes an threat only when it takes form of violence and secessionist tendency.
 
**Conclusion template :::**
 
**Que. Growing feeling of regionalism is a necessary condition for the demand of separate states. Discuss**  
**Que. Do you agree that regionalism in India appears to be a consequence of rising cultural assertiveness? Argue.**
 - Sometimes when it has secessionist tendencies it threatens the territorial integrity
- Unequal distribution of resources due to the presence of strong regional leaders also leads to relative deprivation 
- It may also hinder international diplomacy (Role of India in Sri Lankan civil war)
- It has become a tool in hands of politicians to serve their vested interest(Vote bank politics)
- It acts as a source o==f== internal security challenges 
- It can be seen as a threat to overall development and unity especially when it has violent overtones

**Negative:**
 - It helps in realizing the salad bowl theory of multiculturalism in the true sense
- It helps in keeping ==political extremism== at bay
- not always the regional interest is pitted against national interest, in fact, sometimes it ensures better integration of people in overall governance 
- By accepting the demands it gives the right of ==self-determination== to the people
- It plays an important role in nation-building if it accommodates  national feelings

**Positive:**

- **Impact of Regionalism-**
- **Types of regionalism-**
    
    - Inter state River water disputes
    - Border Issues-Despite between Punjab and Haryana over Chandigarh
    
    - Bodoland
    - Gorkha land
    - Vidharbha
    - Saurashtra
    
    - ==greater nagalim==
    - ==Khalistan==
    
    - North Indian states vs south Indian states on the issue of regionalism 
**Ques. What is the basis of regionalism? Is economic inequality is the most important factor behind regionalism?**

- **Basis of Regionalism-**
    
    - It supported regionalism on the basis of cultural heritage, folklore, myths, etc.
    - for ex: demand for ==Dravidanadu==(Dravidistan) was supported by the theory that Dravidian-speaking areas once had non-Brahminical polity which was destroyed by Aryan conquests and hegemony.
    
    - Presence of natural resources, landforms, international borders, connectivity, climate, rainfall, buffer area, etc.
    - Example - ==Northeast== --\> Presence of Chicken neck, ==99% of its borders are international,== Punjab and Northeast - ==Golden Triangle and Golden crescent==
    
    - ==Language== has been a most important mark of group identification hence giving rise to linguistic regionalism 
    - Example - Bifurcation of greater ==Assam==
    - Although there have been some demands based on caste and religion for example, in the context of Tamilnadu, and Punjab respectively, however, since these demands were considered a threat to the secular fabric of India they were presented in the garb(veil) of linguistic demands
    
    - ==Politics== do not create regionalism, it accentuates(आग में घी डालना) regionalism. It takes advantage of the situation of regional discontent and converts it in their favour so as to strengthen their vote bank
    
    - It is the crux of regional politics. It is based on the fact that resources are limited and demands are disproportionate 
    - The govt. policies since independence have failed to address regional disparities and instead aggravated the regional inequality and economic differences.
    - Due to the unequal distribution of development benefits, there has been a demand for smaller states
    - Example - Despite being rich in natural resources some regions remain underdeveloped like North East.
    - Telangana did accuse Andhra of colonizing their region, by grabbing their jobs, land, and govt not investing n their infrastructure, opportunities, etc.
      
     - **Landmarks that lead to the emergence of Regionalism-**
    
    - The democratic form of govt
    - Linguistic Reorganisation of states
    - Integration of princely states
    - The selfish interest of the politician - Negative-
    
    - Resorting to ==violence==
    - ==Secession==(threat to the territorial integrity of country)
    - **Son of soil** ==-== State constitutes the exclusive homeland of its main language speakers or local residents
        
        - Example - Karnataka, Maharashtra, Haryana, Assam
        - Factors responsible for Son of soil-
- Positive-
    
    - If we intend to concretize our own identity(Linguistic reorganization of states)
    - If for purpose of socio-economic development (Telangana)
    - If for administrative convenience(Uttarakhand)
- **Politics of Regionalism-**
- When all these factors are geographically concentrated along with the ==feeling of relative deprivation== 
- Regionalism is rooted in India's diversity wrt caste, religion, language, ethnicity, etc.

Definition:
 - **Regionalism**

**Ques. In the context of diversity of India, can it be said that region form the cultural units rather then states? Give reasons with examples.**  
 - **Concept of Region-**
    
    - Homogeneous area
    - Physically and culturally distinct from the neighbouring area
    - people living in the region have sufficient awareness that they are similar but distinct from others
    - development of regional identity 
    - People start professing their political loyalties more towards the region rather than the state/country which it is a part of.  
### Regional Diversity
 - Cultural platforms should try to promote peace and harmony between different groups
- ==Active participation of NGOs and civil society t==o drive away the mistrust between different communities
- Setting up of peace communities, responsible and restraint journalism, extremist communal outfits should be immediately targeted and their capacity to disrupt law and order must be crippled
- Establishment of hotlines wrt complains in the context of communal conflicts
- Codified guidelines for administration, a specialized training module for police  to handle communal riots
- Reform in the ==criminal justice system, speedy trials, adequate compensation, increased representatio==n of minorities in law enforcement agencies, training of forces in human rights
- Value of peace, nonviolence, cooperation, and development of scientific temper, needs to be instilled
- ==Value based on education== without any ideological coloration
- Eradicating the problems of ==poverty, unemployment, and illiteracy.==

**Way forward :** **Measures to tackle fundamentalism****-**
 
**Ques. "Modernity is breeding religious fundamentalism". Critically analyse the statement.**
 - In addition to these, there is also a need of(necessary condition but not sufficient) -
    
    - ==Ideological Cohesion== =\> Having a single sacred text which makes it easier to mobilize people
    - Supply of Potential Recruits (Those who are Relatively deprived)
    - ==Charismatic Leadership== =\> Example: Hitler
    - Communication (Technology) =\>There is faster dissemination of ideas

    - ==Strong Civil Society (==Counter Civil Society e.g. ISIS -\> concept given by ==Neera Chandhoke)==
- **Steve Bruce** says - There are two necessary conditions (but not sufficient) for the ==emergence of== fundamentalism==-==
    
    1. Modernisation
        
        - Rational/Progressive transformation
    2. Secularisation
        
        - Differentiation
        - Privatization
        - The decline in the social significance of religion
- **Causes-** - Rationale - Due to globalization, the world has changed so much that it has threatened the possibility of preserving and promoting the beliefs and practices 
- Gabriel Almond - A violent offshoot of communalism, The visible pattern of religious  militancy in which self-styled true believers try to arrest the erosion of religious identity.
- **Concept-**
    
    - Tradition defended in the traditional way
    - Sometimes violent manifestation
    - However, in common sense understanding, it often used in negative connotations
- Fundamentalism refers to the belief in the strict adherence to ideology or principles.
    
    - Religious extremism
    - Rejection of modernity.
_Religious Fundamentalism_  

### Que. Communalism arises either due to power struggle or relative deprivation. Discuss( 10 marks/150 words)
 
# Society Class 09
 - Lack of mutual trust, and understanding between the people of different communities.
- Social media: ==Ho==w in the name of anonymity it has become the medium for the spread of hate, radicalization of youths, in-groups, development of prejudices, etc.
- Role of media: ==In t==he name of sensationalization and criminalization is also been the reason for increasing tensions between different groups.
- Administrative failure with respect to tackling the situation of communal violence.
- ==Politics of appeasement.== For e.g. Act passed by the government to overturn the SC judgment in the Shah Bano judgment.
- ==Divisive politics== is making use of religious and cultural differences so as to serve their vested interest.
- Perceive or real ==deprivation==
- Lack of adequate opportunities for socio-economic development.
- ==Lack== ==of== ==cultural integration== ==--\> stereotype --\> prejudice attitude --\> Violent manifestation --\> Target group resorting to technique of invisibility for survival --\>== Ghettoization --\> Lack of cultural integration.
- Even in the post-independent period, the government failed to come to terms with communalism hence it has persisted for so long. 
- There was an implicit acceptance that they only share economic and political interests, however, they are socially and culturally different.
- The failure of national leadership to unify different sections of society was restricted to the policy of negotiation with leaders of different religious organizations.

**Reasons****:**
 
- To counter the growing national movement, communalism became the main tool of colonialism.
- For example Tolerance towards communal press plus separate electorate, the policy of favouring one community against others in government jobs, political positions, etc.
- The overthrow of the colonial state is the only state that was only a necessary condition to fight communalism but not sufficient.

3. Also the result of elite power struggle.
 ![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044826-26.png)

2. The socio-economy reality of India has been such that class distinction is connected with religious distinction class: Have's and Have's not.
 - Stagnation of agriculture + Lack of modern industries + Limited opportunities for modern education **==\>** Demand and aspirations of the middle class was not getting addressed as a discrepancy between demand and availability of opportunity =\> Groupism, nepotism =\> Sowed the seeds of communalism.
- However, the region while it has persisted for so long, the genesis can be traced to the British period.
- ==E.g.:== ==Destruction of temples, f==orced conversions, ==imposition of taxes on religious practices== of other religions, etc. 
1. The communal bickering did start before the emergence of British rule.
 
**Evolution of communalism**:
 - According to TK Oommen ==f==irst 3 are not a threat to national integration but the last 3 are.
- **Secessionist:**
    
    - The demand for a separate nation based on religion is referred to as secessionist communalism.     
- **Separatist**:
    
    - The demand for autonomy on the basis of religion, however within the ambit of the Indian union.
    -  However, the demand for a separate nation based on religion is referred to a==s secessionist communalism==.
- **Retaliatory:**
    
    - Communities have mutually hostile interests and often it is manifested in the form of communal violence.
- **Retreatism:**
    
    - The members of the ==Bahai community== forbid their members to participate in political matters since it is based on the ideology of unity of God, religion, mankind, etc.
- **Welfarist:**
    
    - Efforts are involved in the social and economic upliftment of their community.
    - For example Employment opportunities, residential accommodation, scholarships, etc.
- **Assimilationist(****आत्मसात्** **करना****)****:**
    
    - When a large religious community assimilates the smaller one within its fold, it is referred to as Assimilationist communalism, it is generally not considered as threat. 

**Types of communalism**:
 - However, this is only a perception as the resources and opportunities can always be increased by promoting inclusive growth and development.
- There exists a perception that the resources in society are limited and if someone's access to resources increases it is at the cost of others.
- **Extreme**:
    
    - Not only different interests but mutually hostile or antagonistic interests (Zero Sum Game Theory of Power).
- **Moderate**:
    
    - People belonging to different religious communities have different interests.
- **Mild**:
    
    - When people belonging to the same religion have the same interests.
- There are **three phases** of communalism:

**Manifestation of communalism**:
 - A man of religion is not communal but the one who practices politics by linking with religion can be termed as "Communal" (Political trade in religion).
- It refers to an ideology according to which the society is divided into different religious communities having different secular interests (socio-economic and political interests).

**Que: Implementation of the language provision proved to be a formidable task in the initial decades after independence. (10 marks/150 words)**  
**Que: Discuss to what extent linguistic reorganization of state has contributed to Indian unity? Discuss. (10 marks/150 words)**  
**Que: Is communalism a threat to national integration? Discuss. (10 marks/150 words)** 
 - However, overall it had removed a major factor affecting the cohesion of the country.
- The basis for the creation of small states was spilled over into other areas such as river water disputes, underdevelopment, administrative convenience, etc.
- It was like opening pandora's box as India is a land of multiple linguistic cultures so even after linguistic reorganization, the demand for the state continues to persist.
    
    - E.g.: Gorkhaland, Mithilanchal, Bhojpur, etc. #remember-for-later
- **Rajani Kothari** said, "linguistic reorganization was functional ==a==s it removed the major source of discord and created homogeneous political units which could be administered through a medium that vast majority understood." _Linguistic organization of states:_  
- **NOTE: Important chapters of Bipin Chandra (India since independence): Chapters: 07, 08, 09, 16, 17 ,18, 22, 24, 29, 30 and 31.** - ==Post-1967,== the problem gradually disappeared from the political scene demonstrating the capacity of the Indian political system to deal with the problem on a demographic basis and in a manner to promote national consolidation.
- ==1967==**:** Official Language Amendment Act was passed which ensured an indefinite policy of bilingualism.
- ==1963== **:** Official language Act was introduced to ensure the use of the English language beyond 1965, however, the text of the act was ambiguous and it generated apprehensions.
- 1956 to 1960: During this time the ==Non-Hindi Speaking people== started protesting and agitated against Hindi as the official language (it is an example of Supra-state regionalism).
- Under ==Article 343, Hindi== ==in== ==Devanagari script== will be the official language and English will be the associate official language till 1965.
- However according to Mahatma Gandhi, "English will never be accepted as the official language due to unequal relations with Britishers".
- English was sought/considered by some as a strong contender : Language of international diplomacy, Trade, and Commerce, Exposure to western thought, and A broad spectrum of academic work was available in the language.
- The adoption of an official language was a debatable issue in the initial decades.
- Often discourse has emerged due to feelings of relative deprivation and fear of domination by the majority of language speakers.
- Language is the most powerful instrument of cultural identity and has always remained a source of both cohesion and conflict.
- India is extremely linguistically diverse and is often known for =="==**Kos Kos par Badle Paani char Kos par Vanni**==".==

# Society Class 08
 - The condition causes some people to take excessive measures to avoid getting pregnant.
- Tokophobia is an ==extreme fear of childbirth.==

**Tokophobia****:**
 - The Minister - in charge of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare will be its chairman.
    
    - It will review and monitor the implementation of the concerned acts.
    - It lays the code of conduct for surrogacy clinics.
    - It sets the minimum standard of physical infrastructure as labs, experts, etc.
    - It will oversee the performance of various related bodies.
    - It will supervise the functioning of the State Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy boards.
- It was set up for the purposes of the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, and the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021.

**National** **Assisted** **Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board:**
 - The surrogate mother can withdraw her consent before implanting the embryo in the womb.
- Penal provisions: Rupees ==10 lakh fine and /or 10 years in prison.==
- It is **permitted** only when it is:
    
    - For the intending ==couple suffering from infertility.==
    - **Altruistic**==.==
    - Only gestational surrogacy is allowed.
    - For any disease as specified through regulation.
    - Not for producing children for sale, prostitution, exploitation, etc.
    - The registration of surrogacy clinics is compulsory.
    - Central/state governments will appoint authorities for calculating and taking action against the breach of provisions.
    - The act also mentions the criteria for surrogate mothers and intending couples.
    - The surrogate child will be the biological child of the intending couple.
    - Abortion would require the written consent of the surrogate mother.
- It ==prohibits commercial surrogacy.==
- It defines surrogacy as a practice where a woman gives birth to a child for intending couple with the intention to hand over the child after birth to the intending couple.￼**Some provisions of the act:**

**Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019:**
   
- It also has provisions against false complaints.
- A memorandum to take action within 60 days of submission of the report.
- The inquiry must be completed in 90 days.
- The Complaint must be filed within 90 days.
- It is applicable to both formal and informal sectors.
- The aggrieved women can be co-workers, clients, customers, or domestic workers of any age and status.
- IT covers both the instances of forced quid pro quo and hostile work environment.
- ==Section 354 (a) of IPC== defines sexual harassment as: “any one or more” of the followin**g “unwelcome acts or behaviour”** committed directly or by implication: physical contact and advances, a demand or request for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography, and any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature.   
- Outlawing extravagant weddings.
- Use of **innovation-diffusion framework,** where key leaders and personalities would be persuaded to spread awareness.
- Efforts to increase Female Labour Force Participation(FLFP). 
- Stigmatization of the practice of dowry through naming and shaming, Mohalla committees, etc.
- Promoting the concept of **Adarsh Marriage****,** where affluent people restrain from lavish weddings.

**The way forward:** 
 - It is associated with the social prestige of the family.
- The practice of ==caste endogamy causes a scarcity of grooms== in certain areas which pushes up the dowry.
- **Sanskritization** with respect to the practice of dowry - lower castes/classes trying to emulate the practices of upper castes/classes after getting financially capable. This is also seen through increased instances of "Pre-Wedding photoshoots".
- It is also identified with the concept of "groom price" which is determined as per the "market value" based on caste, future prospects, education, job, etc.
- It is treated as an investment hoping for a **quid pro quo** in the future (more commonly for government servants).
- Increased **consumerist** culture.
- Acceptance of the dowry culture both by men and women due to the fact that the ==hierarchical relationship== between men and women is accepted by all.

**Reasons for rising  incidences of dowry** (from around ==40% in the 1930s== to around ==90% in the 2000s==):
 - Punishment with imprisonment or fine or both for giving or taking or abetting the giving or taking of dowry, demanding dowry, and even advertisement related to dowry.
- State governments must appoint Dowry Prohibition Officers.
- It makes the agreement for giving or taking dowry void.
- The ==burden== of ==proof is on the accused.==
- Every offense under this act is ==non-bailable and non-compoundable==.
- Dowry is considered a cognizable offense for the purpose of investigation.

**Some features of the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961:**
 - It does not include ==Mahr or Streedhan (G==ifts given to a girl so as to meet her financial needs) and Bride price as practiced by some tribal communities like Yanadi of Andhra Pradesh and Baria, Padi, and Damor of Gujarat.
- As per the **Dowry Prohibition Act 1961,** dowry includes any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given directly/indirectly by one party to a marriage to another. 
- This is believed to be the most important reason behind sex-selective abortion, girl infanticide, lack of investment in the education of the girl child, domestic violence, and the overall skewed sex ratio. 
### Dowry:
 - **Despite dowry prohibition act the practice still persist in the society, explain the factors responsible.** - The case can be filed against men, women, and even children.
- The act is a **civil law,**  and it becomes a criminal offense that is a cognizable and non-bailable offense only when the protection orders are breached.
- The ambit of "woman" as per the act includes wife, mother, daughter, sister, live-in relationship partner, and divorced wife.
- As per the **Domestic Violence Act 2005,** domestic violence includes ==both the abuse and the threat of abuse== which can be physical, verbal, emotional, sexual, or economic nature.
- According to the **Ministry of Statistics & Program Implementation,** and **th****e National Commission of Women,** ==d==omestic violence has the largest share of the overall violence against women.
_Domestic Violence:_  
- The **way forward** must be **penalization** of misuse and not the dilution of the provisions.
- Corruption of value systems.
- ==Gender stereotyping== - women are always weak, passive, and dependent.
- The secularisation of marriage - so divorce does not have the old taboo.
- Unbalanced nature of the society so ==women seek monetary benefits.==
- Seeking ==vendetta==/Revenge vendetta.
- Lack of gender neutral laws.

**We are seeing an increasing number of false cases because:**
 - **Explain the paradox where increase violence against women justifies strong laws where as on the other hand this laws have been misused by some women.**
- **Despite increase in legal provisions, violence against women is on the rise. Discuss**
- It involves two aspects:
    
    1. **Vertical convergence:**
        
        - National, state, District, and Local level cooperation and accountability.
    2. **Horizontal convergence:**
        
        - Joint efforts through laws, political will, infrastructure, funds, and societal awareness.
          
        

**Convergence approach:**
 - Need for a convergence approach.
- ==Psychological counsellin==g and rehabilitation of victims
- Engage with men and boys as the agents of change, like the =="He for She " campaign.==
- Creating awareness among women through continuous efforts by using social media charismatic personalities, street plays, etc.
- De-stigmatisation of VAW.
- Gender - sensitization of all stakeholders.
- Value-based education without any gender coloration.
- Moral overhauling of the society.

**The long-term way forward:**
 - Use of technology to create gender-friendly infrastructure and space (both physical and virtual).
- Mechanisms to protect the privacy and dignity of the victim.
- Social innovations like ==One Stop Centres, Mahila Police Volunteers( MPVs), Oink buses and autos, etc.==
- Setting up helpline/mobile apps.
- Regulation of public transport (GPS CCTV cameras).
- Promote the concept of ==Community policing and Mohalla committees.==
- Training women in self-defence.
- Strict patrolling /vigilance at night.
- Quick disposal of cases through fast-track courts.
- Strict enforcement of laws.

**Short-term way forward**
 - It hinders the realization of fundamental rights under articles 14 and 21 of the constitution.
- It obstructs the participation of women in development and policy making as it obstructs their ability to act more freely.￼**Rights issue:**
- Indirect effects on the upbringing of the child and intergenerational psychological costs.￼**Development issue:**
- The direct costs include the loss of income, productivity, health and the cost of healthcare.
- It affects the mental, physical and reproductive health of women.￼**Economic issues:**
- VAW is a preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in women.

**The implications of VAW:**  
**Health issues:**
 - When we commit a small or petty offense at an early stage for which we are not reprimanded, the chances of committing a heinous offense at a later stage are very high.

**Broken Window theory:** #important
 
- Poor conviction rates.
- Delay in judicial proceedings.
- Lack of awareness among women with respect to their rights.
- Fear of stigmatization leads to a large number of cases not being reported.
- Lack of efforts for attitudinal change both by the government and society.
- The gender-biased attitude of the law enforcement agencies.
- Corruption of the value system.
- Failure of the state to provide adequate infrastructure.
- Lack of gender - segregated data.
- ==Broken Window theory :== Most men and women while growing up normalize violence against women.
 
- ==90 % of both men and women are biased against women.==
- 50 % believed males are better political leaders.
- 40% of them believe men are better corporate executives.
- 28 % believe that it is fine for a husband to beat his wife.
- It covered 70 countries which combinedly had 80% of the global population
 - The lack of courage among women to report results in low deterrence against such actions.  
- ==Institutional weaknesses like a lack of stringent laws, ro==bust implementation, gender sensitivity, poor conviction rates, etc.
- Even working women face such abuse because there the male hegemony is threatened.
- The nuclear family setup along with the no-child policy of new-age couples often see women being treated as cushions to vent out frustration.
- Situational factors ==: Drug abuse, Alcoholism, etc.==
- Some traditional cultural practices lik==e Female Genital Mutilation.==
- The ==economical== ==dependence== of women accords them a subordinate status and perpetrators believe they can hence "get away" with violence.
- The institutionalization of ==patriarchy==, by both men and women, causes the normalization of such incidents, as seen by the **Gender Social Norm Index by UNDP.**

**Causes of violence against women:**
 - It is used to refer to the increased instances of domestic violence during the last pandemic.

**Shadow pandemic:**
 - Out of the remainin==g 14%, only 7% could rea==ch a proper authority.
- ==77% of those women did not share== the violence with anyone.
- It is estimated that **around** **86%** **of the women did not seek help.**
- ==NCW== data says that Uttar Pradesh reported most such incidents, followed by Delhi and Haryana.
- **National Commission for Women (NCW)** said ==a 46 % increase in violen==ce against women in the first 8 months of 2021.
- It includes female infanticide, trafficking, dowry-related deaths, etc.
- Any act of gender-based violence that results in physical, sexual, or mental harm is referred to as violence against women. ![41r 4](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044820-24.png)

### Violence against women
   
- Incentives to improve the desirability of pregnant women like through tax breaks.
- Introducing f==lexible work conditions== like a hybrid model of working ==(work from home== or from the office).
- **Singapore**- 16 weeks of paid leave of which 8 weeks are borne by the company and 8 weeks are borne by the government.
- **Sweden's model** o==f 480 days of paren==tal paid leave gets split between the parents, with a ==minimum of 90 days for ea==ch partner.
-  Extending the benefits to the informal sector.

**The way forward:**
 - It might ==reinforce gender stereotypes== of care role
- Cost competitiveness of smaller enterprises.
- It may aggravate the glass-ceiling effect and wage gap.
- Even the **International** **Labour Organisation(ILO)** ==advises only 14 weeks of paid maternity lea==ve, so many perceive that 26 weeks is too much time when women remain out of touch with the labour market, and it can give rise to structural unemployment.
- The ==desirability of reproductive-age women== in the labour market will ==decrease== as they would be seen as incurring additional costs to the company.
- The benefits are ==not extended to the informal sector w==here the majority of the women work.

**Cons:**
 - It promotes small family norms as the 26-weeks paid leave is conditional only for the first two children.
- Arrest the trend of a career break.
- Early socialization.
- Early childhood care.
- Income security.
- Benefits to women in the formal sector.

**Pros of the act:**
 - **Critically analyse** **to what** **extent MBA 2017** **will achieve its desired** **objective****.(10m)** - Even the adopting(child less then 3 months) and commissioning mothers (a biological mother who uses her egg to create an embryo implanted in another woman) can avail of 12 weeks of leave.
- The ==employer needs to inform== the women employees about the ==provisions of the act.==
- It can be availed 8 weeks before the expected date of delivery.
- It will cover only the formal sector.
- ==Creche facility i==n organizations with more than ==fifty employees,== and ==four visits to the creche per day==.
- It will be only for 12 weeks for the third child onwards.
- It will be a conditional leave for up to two children only.
- Paid leave of up to ==26 weeks.==

**Provisions of the act:**

### Maternity Benefits Act (Amendment) 2017
 
- We should be aware of the premises(background) of the act.
- The provisions of the act.
- The analysis (pros and cons) of the act.
- The way forward as per the cons.
- From the prelims point of view, only the provisions are important.
- While writing answers in the mains examination - the premises of the act can be the introduction, provisions of the act can be the main body and the way forward will be the conclusion.

 - ### Briefly discuss the potential of paternity leave to create gender equality in the labour market, also discuss the challenges associated.
     ![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044809-21.png)  
![02 Y 3 0 0 0](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044806-20.png)- Some noteworthy international precedents include **Sweden** which has mandated  ==480 days of paid leave== to be shared by both, with a minimum of 90 days by one partner. 
##### Zomato India provides 26 weeks of paid leave for new fathers.
 - It is not mandatory for private organizations in India, but some organizations have taken initiatives on their own:
- This also extends to adopted children and can be availed up to 6 months from the date of delivery or adoption.
- All India & Civil Services Rules allow Central government employees with less than two surviving children 1==5 days of paternity leave.==
- There is no such legal provision in India.
- It is a paid leave period reserved exclusively for the fathers during childbirth. ![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044805-19.png)  
_Paternity Leave:_  
- It might lead to even more exploitation in household works as there is no standardization for the value of a myriad of household chores done.
- It will rob the activities done out of love of their essence.

**Unpaid domestic work must not be monetized because:**
 - Research by **Esther Duflo** on Indian panchayats suggests that women-headed panchayats see more inclusive and socially productive use of funds than the panchayats headed by men which focus more on economical gains.
- It will give more ==autonomy to women to spend.==

**Unpaid domestic work must be monetized because:**
 - **Oxfam** research says - If all work of women gets monetized, it will be valued at around $ 10 trillion. #remember-for-later
- Increased vulnerability to emergency events due to lack of social security cover.
- Deteriorates life quality due to issues like sleep deprivation, social inclusiveness, etc.
- Increase in gender hierarchies in the family.
- Discrimination in hiring and pay.
- It prevents women from actively pursuing further education & employment opportunities, and raising their skill level. 
- It causes time poverty and time stress and generates considerable opportunity costs.

**Impact of skewed informal participation on women :**
 - Restricted mobility after marriage.
- Women have limited access to formal sector jobs due to lesser educational opportunities.
- Society continues to look down upon working women, especially those with irregular working hours.
- This results in the early socialization of most of the girls for domestic chores.
- The prevailing gender stereotype believes that women are by their very nature caring and nurturing.

**Causes of more representation of women in unpaid work:** 

-   
    
- Up to ==91% of Indian women in paid jobs are in the informal sector.==
- This indicates that domestic responsibilities are borne mainly by women, even if they have access to better education and employment opportunities.
- Irrespective of the educational status of women, the time for unpaid work remains roughly the same. ![00 0 3 5](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044801-18.png)  
![Unpaid work Care work care of persons living in th...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044759-17.png)- 91.8% of women in India between the ages of 15 and 59 participated in unpaid domestic work for household members in 2019, as compared to 20% of men.

**According to Economic Survey:**
 _Unpaid work:-_  
- According to **OECD**, the wage gap in India exists because:
    
    - Undervaluation of “care work”.
    - Lack of bargaining power among women.
- According to the online salary index Monster, the ==wage gap in India is 20%.==
- It refers to the situation where women are paid less than men for doing the same work.
_Wage Gap:_  

- **On Women:**
    
    - Lack of opportunity for upward social mobility.
    - Lack of financial autonomy.
    - Lack of decision-making authority. 
    - Lack of ability to influence the direction of social change.
    - Lack of identifying and embracing their own feelings that may cause **Self -Alienation.**
    - It can negatively impact the cognitive development of women, social participation and interpersonal skills.
- **On Family:**
    
    - Negatively impacts the standard of living
    - The lost income might decrease the standard of living of the family.
    - Perpetuation of patriarchy -\> further leads to strengthening of stereotypes
- **On the Nation:**
    
    - It might cause a substantial part of the demographic dividend to turn into a demographic burden.
    - It comes with a large impact on economic growth- According to **McKinsey**, if ==FLFP== gets equal to MLFP, then Indian GDP will increase by 60 %.
    - It will increase the incidences of social evils such as ==domestic violence, child marriage, dowry, etc.==
    - Threatens the possibility of achieving the SDG5 (sustainable developmental goal)
- **On an International Level:**
    
    - It will threaten the prospects of India emerging as a global power, as poor indicators of FLFP will severely dent our soft power.

**Effects of low FLFP:**
 - Since the passage of the Maternity Benefit Act (Amendment), 2017 the desirability of women in the reproductive age group has declined in the formal labour market.
- According to **McKenzie** **Global Institute**==, 12 millio==n Indian women will lo==se jobs== by 2030 due to ==automation==.
- According to ==Azim Premji University State of Working India report== - 7% of men have lost jobs post covid, where==as 47% of== women have suffered permanent job loss after covid. - **In the backdrop of decline in FLFP analyse its implication in context of Indian society.** - **In the context of recent global gender gap report, discuss the factors responsible for decline in FLFP in India.** - So women have minimal participation in the gig and platform-based jobs.
- ==Digital divide -== A study says that ==only 21% of women in India are internet users.==
- Social constraints like socialization for domestic chores, rigid patriarchal setup, career break, gender stereotypes etc.
- Infrastructural constraints (lack of  CCTVs, child care facilities, conducive work environment etc) at workplaces.
- **Lack of incentive** among women to work (dual work, glass ceiling, gender gap, accessibility, pink collared jobs, sexual harassment, lack of autonomy in decision making ability).
- Lack of investment in sectors that can readily absorb women like textiles, apparel, etc.

![reVlSlOt Tse Nl](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044752-15.png)- Feminization U-hypothesis: Feminization U hypothesis suggests that initially, female labour force participation will reduce with increasing economic growth, but will ultimately increase as the economy grows and undergoes substantial structural changes.
- Caste notions of purity and pollution extended to gender roles (Uma Chakravarti’s concept of Brahmanical Patriarchy).
- Increase in household income.

**Causes for decline in FLFP:**
 - ==14.6 % of women== are at the ==senior== level and only  ==8.9 % are a==t the ==managerial== level
- The percentage of women in technical and professional roles ==is 29.2%==(STEM)
- WEF also says that the ==income== earned by women ==is 1/5====th== ==of men.==
- Female participation in the ==labour force is 22.3%.==
- As per th==e== **Global Gender Gap** ==re==port by **World Economic Forum(WEF):**

**Statistics:**
 _Female Labour Force Participation (FLFP):_  
- The social standing and bargaining power of such women remain stunted.
- Informal employment sees women getting paid less than minimum wages, less safe working conditions, no social security benefits, and severely restricted career progression.
- The women hence remain confined to the informal sector.
- This deprivation/dependence restricts access to education and skill development which causes fewer opportunities for formal employment.
- Patriarchy reduces the development and growth avenues of women that causes women to stay deprived or be dependent on male members. ![lack](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044750-14.png)

**The vicious cycle:**
 - Despite the increase in female enrolment in higher education, it is not getting reflected in the manufacturing and services sector. This is due to -\> Career break due to reproductive responsibility.
- Lack of Investment in technical and vocational education.
- **Socialization** for domestic chores.
- Restricted mobility after marriage.
- Lack of flexible working conditions, accessibility, safety and security Issues.
- Lack of ==women role models - a==ccording to **Deloitte**, on==ly 4.7 % of CEOs in India are women==.
- Lack of awareness with respect to opportunities.

**Analysis of the statistics:**
 - According to **International Labor Organization (ILO)**, in India women in the ==manufacturing and== services sector combined is less than 20%.
- According to the **Consulate General of Sweden** in India, women in the manufacturing sector are between ==3% and 12%.==
- According to ==General Electric (G.E.)== ==and Avatar Research, in== India, women's participation in the m==anufacturing sector is 12%.==

# Society Class 06
 ![0](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044749-13.png)

According to the **UNO**, Women empowerment is a sense of self-worth, access to resources (socio-politico and economy), autonomy in decisions making, control over their reproductive lives, and ability to influence the direction of social change.

- Government has started skilling of girls in non-traditional livelihood option under Beti bachao beti padhao. - ### **Women empowerment**
     - **"Feminization of Agriculture has led to women empowerment." Critically analyse the statement with respect to Indian society.**
- **Discuss the economic and socio-cultural factors responsible for the feminization of agriculture in India. (CSE-2022; 10 marks)**

- Lack of gender-sensitive nature of agricultural extension services.
- ==Increased mechanization of agriculture== has resulted in the concentration of women in menial jobs.
- Lack of awareness of their rights and their entitlements.
- ==Lack of autonom==y with respect to decision-making on important issues such as ==marketing, crop selection, etc.==
- **78%** of women farmers face Gender discrimination.
- Technological interventions are often not designed according to women farmers hence there is a lack of supportive infrastructure.
- Wage Gap
- Due to a lack of ownership -\> Lack of collateral security -\> lack of access to the formal credit system -\> dependency on informal money lenders(very high interest rates) -\> debt traps -\> **Fem of poverty**
- Lack of ownership of assets ==(E.g.: 14% of landholding owned by women).==
- **Challenges**: - Cases of Operation Flood, SEWA(self employed women association), etc led to the development of leadership, financial dependency, child nourishment, etc.
- It reduces the incidences of child labour and creates opportunities for the nutritional development of children.
- It increases their ==bargaining power.==
- It ensures the development of skills and confidence.
- It makes their ==labour visibl==e and accounted for to some extent.
- It provides an opportunity to ==socialize==.
- It brings women to the ==public sphere.==
- **Positives of the Feminization of Agriculture**: - The government has also increased its focus on ==Self Help Groups== to ensure sustainable livelihood for them.
- Mahila Kishan Shashakti Pariyojana. #remember-for-later
- 15th October is celebrated as the farmers' day.
- **Government Initiatives:** - **NOTE: Kindly refer to the relevant diagram drawn by Smriti ma'am in the live class.**
- **Politico-Administrative factors.** - Farmers suicide.
- Feminization of Old-age.
- Flexible labour ==(Surinder S Jodhka)==
- easy to manage Dual Burden.
- Socio-cultural acceptance of working in the agriculture sector.
- **Socio-cultural cause**: - ==Globalization== created opportunities but are Limited to skilled workforce, woman due to patriarchy lacks the required skill.
- Small and marginal farmers can not afford to hire labour on wages (depending upon the labour of women in the family) --\> which leads to the feminization of agriculture.
- Cheap labour ==(wage gap is 35.8%).==
- ==Male-specific migration== to urban areas and hence feminization of agriculture.
- Since most farmers are small and marginal (to sustain the family income -\> increased participation of women in agriculture).
- **Economic cause**:    - A measurable increase in women's participation in the agricultural sector is referred to as the feminization of agriculture.
- **Feminization of agriculture(FoA)**: - According to Corteva Agri Science, **78%** ==of women in== agriculture are subject to ==gender-based discrimination.==
- The ==wage disparity is as high as== **35.8%.**
- **80%** of the farm work and **90%** of dairy production work is done by women.
- According to the ==Agriculture Census,== **14%** ==of land o==perational holdings are ==owned by women.==
- It consists of **48%** self-employed farmers and **33%** agricultural labour.
- As per **Oxfam research**==,== agriculture employs **80%** ==o==f all economically active women in India.

- However, instead of getting challenged, ==private patriarchy to public patriarchy:==
    
    - Sexual Harassment at the workplace.
    - Dual burden
    - Glass ceiling
    - Wage gap
    - Pink collared jobs
    - Violence against women.
- Based on ==Gender stereotypes (==Domestic division of labour) : Women confined to private space -\> It was believed with the rise Female Labour Force Participation (notions of patriarchy getting challenged).

### Patriarchy vis-a-vis Work:
 - The notion of **purity and pollution** has been extended to women.
- Hence, caste not only determines the social division of labour but also a **sexual division of labour.**
- Hence, the caste system and caste endogamy retain the control over labour and sexuality of women.
- Caste and gender are closely related and the sexuality of women is directly linked with the purity of caste.
_Caste:_  
- E.g.: Certain personal laws are biased against women.
- The patriarchal construction of society is legitimized by religion and religious institutions.
_Religion:_  
- Cinema through its **sexiest content** also perpetuates patriarchy.
- Certain images are created for **damsels in distress** image which is glorified through cinema.
- A more subtle expression of patriarchy is through symbolism by creating a **self-sacrificing image of women**. Through ideological indoctrination, the notion of ideal womanhood is created.
_Symbolism:_  
- ==Large no of STEM==(science, Technology, engineering and mathematics) has underrepresentation of women. - According to **ASER**(annual status of education report) (by NGO **PRATHAM**) at the secondary level, the dropout of girl students is also due to a ==lack of functional toilets.==
- Education: Content, the attitude of the teachers and infrastructure. 
- Objectification and commodification of women through media. E.g.==:== ==Advertisements.==
- Patriarchal construction of knowledge perpetuates patriarchal ideology and this is reflected in our education system and media.
_Knowledge system:_  
- **E.g.:**
    
    1. Boy child is considered as the inheritor whereas a girl child is considered as 'Paraya Dhan'.
    2. Since most of the families are patrilinear and patrilocal, it accords the low status to the girl child.
    3. ==Primary socialisation w==ith respect to the ==notions of gender stereotyping.==
- The first lesson of patriarchy is learned at the family level.
_Family:_  
- ### Structure (Family, education, media, symbolism, caste, religion):
     - Hence, we can say Brahminical patriarchy is different from Dalit patriarchy and also that is different from tribal patriarchy.
- The nature of control and subjugation of women varies with respect to class, caste, religion, ethnicity, etc.

**Patriarchy** as a concept is not the constant and gender relation has changed over time and space.
 - **Definition**: A woman bargains with patriarchy to support male dominance to gain protection, status, resources, and approval, inside the system that she considers she might lose outside the system.
- Although patriarchy refers to the domination of men, women equally place a significant role in perpetuating patriarchy. The concept is known as a patriarchal bargain ==(concept given by Deniz kandiyoti)==
- It refers to the system of social structures and practices in which men oppress, exploit and discriminate against women. 
### **Patriarchy**
 - **Andre Beteille** ==says "Law determines the direction in which society should move. However, it is the culture which determines the direction in which society actually moves".==   - **Gender stereotyping** (irrational, generalised and overlooking individual differences) **and** **Social position****:**
    
    1. Caring & nurturing : It tries to justify Domestic division of labour, low wages for care work, don't question women if laws are violated.  
    2. Soft skills : Pink Collared jobs (Certain jobs are reserved for women in the market. ==E.g.: Reception, Nurse, Primary school teacher, secretary, HR etc).==
    3. Emotional rather than rational : Glass Ceiling (it refers to a transparent ceiling in every organization beyond which a woman is not promoted). However, in time of crisis woman is promoted to decision-making authority is promoted as the risk of failure is high (Glass Cliff).
    4. Weak, passive and dependent : Violence against women. 
### How gender stereotyping impacts the social position of women:
 - **Manifestation of Gender**:
    
    - **Individual:**
        
        - Men and women.
    - **Cultural**:
        
        - Aspirations, desires, values, attitudes, behaviour  
    - **Structural**:
        
        - Sexual division of labour (men-to earn livelihood, woman-take care of domestic chores) - **Concept of** **Gender** : Socially constructed aspect of differences between men and women.   ![9 ence](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044742-10.png)

### Overview : -
 
# Women Issues
 
# Society Class 05
 - Rigid rules with respect to **caste endogam**y when breached **result in honour killing/violence.**  
- Glorification of fringe elements also reduces the deterrence factor.
- According to the apex court, there have been incidences where the existing laws have been missed and the term was coined **new legal terrorism** where instead of these provisions as a shield they were used as a weapon to settle personal agenda/scores.
- There is a fear of retaliation.
- Many do not report the act of discrimination as there is a lack of subjective realisation of objective reality and consider it as a matter of fate.
- The process of **Sanskritization** when challenged by the upper/forward castes, it also results in violence against Dalits.
- Lack of strict implementation of existing provisions, poor conviction rate. 
    
    - According to NCRB in 2020, out of 50216 cases, only 216 conviction rate was reported, The pendency case was very high.(systemic issues - justice delayed is justice denied)
- According to **Christopher Jefferlot,** the increased status of Dalits with respect to secular hierarchy acts as a threat to the hegemony of the forward caste which results in the feeling of deprivation leading to violence.
- **Lack of reporting** by Dalits since their livelihood depends upon the upper castes.
- Lack of adequate representation of Dalits within administration and law enforcement agencies.
- **Persistence of a rigid caste system** despite the efforts of the government to eradicate its discriminatory component.
- Lack of awareness about the legal safeguards.
    
    - E.g.: Prevention of Atrocities Act.
- According to the NCRB==(national crime reports bureau) 2020,== there was a 9.5% rise in violence against Dalits.

### Violence against Dalit
 - **Despite stringent legal provisions, Violence against Dalits is on the rise. Discuss.**
- However, it might be one of the means for emancipation, however, it does not guarantee their empowerment due to the following reasons:
    
    1. It does not change the existing social mindset with respect to caste rigidities.
    2. Due to the restrictions with respect to opportunities, they may lack the cultural capital and hence not be able to reap the benefits of Dalit capitalism. Hence, the benefits will only be reaped by those who are already elite within the Dalit community which will further aggravate the divide.
    3. It might create a situation where Dalit capitalists have to confront various challenges with respect to social and administrative respects.
    4. It still lacks in ensuring the upliftment of the poorest of poor as it does not focus on self-respect, social exclusion, land alienation, etc.
      
    
- E.g.: ==DICCI==, ==NSCFDC==, ==Standup India scheme.==
- The government is also promoting "Dalit Capitalism".
- It creates an opportunity for economic empowerment of Dalits and results in their upward social mobility.
- The term has been coined by **Chandrabhan Prasad**.
- In simple words, entrepreneurship and self-employment among Dalits are referred to as Dalit capitalism.
- When **capitalism** is seen as a tool for the emancipation of Dalits, it is referred to as =="====Dalit capitalism====".== 
1. Concept
2. Who coined the term
3. Is it the panacea for Dalit problems?
 
**Question: To what extent is the reservation policy in India acted as a tool for social empowerment.**
 
- New social yardsticks to determine reservation. ==E.g.:== **NALSA judgement(2014)**==,== according to which transgenders are most deprived section of society and should be given reservation under OBC status.
- **M Nagaraj case** ==a==nd **Zernail case,** in both the cases the SC, has asked to introduce a creamy layer within SCs and STs. (Dereservation based on social mapping)
- ==Capability== (human capital formation: accumulation of knowledge, skill, health over a period of time) approach of Amartya Sen.
- ==Overhauling of the== ==education system== ==(==RTE in secondary education); quality of education (government schools) at par with private schools.
- The robust administrative system is to ensure the penetration of reservation benefits for different sections.
- Encourage the **culture of entrepreneurship** where youth is transformed from 'job seeker to job giver'. 
    
    - E.g. Standup India
- Make agriculture lucrative.
    
    - E.g. Food Processing
- **M S Swaminathan** says "the future belongs to a nation with grains rather than a gun".

 - It was introduced to ensure the equality of opportunity, correct the historical injustice and give effect to the redistributive agenda of the state.
    
    - Distributive justice

### Rationale:
 - Reservation policy refers to a form of affirmative action whereby the percentage of seats is reserved for the people belonging to socially and educationally backward communities.

### Concept:
 
## Reservation
   

**Question: The caste system is assuming new identities and associational forms. Hence it can not be eradicated in India. Comment**  
**Question: Has caste lost its relevance in understanding Indian society? Elaborate your answers with illustrations. (10 marks; CSE-2020)**
 - Since there are strict rules with respect to the exchange of food and water, people of upper caste were not purchasing the food products from the people of lower caste.
- According to ==ActionAid NGO====, In more than== ==25%== ==of villages,== l==ower caste people== are not allowed to work on the agricultural land as casual labour and also ==suffer== ==from== ==wage discrimination==.
- According to Satish Deshpande , untouchability is practised through Ghettoization and separate utensils for serving foods & water.
- According to the study conducted by Amit Thorat and Omkar Joshi, 30% of Urban households are practising untouchabilit==y.==

### Counterarguments:

### Caste system in Rural and Urban areas:
 
# Society Class 04
 - Political Association
    
    - Pressure groups
    - Harijan Sevak Sangh
    - Bahujan samaj party (BSP)
- Economic Associations-
    
    - ==DICCI== (Dalit Indian chamber of commerce and industry)
    - ==NSCFDC== (National Scheduled Caste Finance and Development Council)
- Social associations based on caste -
    
    - Caste-based matrimony
    - Educational society and ==Dalit Sahitya etc==
- According to the All India survey for ==higher education(ministry of education) - GER = 27(gross enrolment ratio but GER(lower caste) = 23.4==
- Gaps wrt Social Indicators- - Despite the 2013 Act recent govt survey by the Ministry of social justice and empowerment, there are 66692 manual scavengers in India.
- According to Bezwada Wilson - from 2016 to 2020 472 deaths by manual scavengers
- According to **NFHS, only 12% of marriages are intercast****e**
_Contemporary reality of caste_

1. **Pre-independence -** Christian missionaries spread the message of Christianity as a reformatory movement against regressive practices.

E.g.: Language +English education  
The emergence of the educated elite group who questioned certain practices   
e.g.: Caste system etc.
 4. **Post-independence -** The opportunities wrt education, and jobs during the British period were largely availed by the upper caste hence their position got consolidated in the socio-political-economic-cultural domain hence came to be known as the entrenched caste.
    
    1. **1st Phase -** Reflects the struggle between entrenched(ES) and ascendent(AS) caste(dominant caste) for power.
    2. **2nd Phase -** It was characterized by the mobilization of lower caste people on caste lines both by ES and AS.
    
    This is referred to as the politicization of caste.
    
    4. **3rd Phase -** It was predicted that with secular education caste neutral jobs formation of multi-caste alliances the rigid caste identities will cease to exist.
    
    However, what we witnessed in was castisation of politics that is the emergence of caste-based political parties  
    E.g. BSP
    
      
    

_Role of Caste in Politics_  

What society obscures cinema reflects
 
Caste has been **dislodged from the ritual domain** however has **entered the psyche of the people during electoral politic**s

- **Mandal Commission** - With this, there was an alteration in caste structure where instead of vertical arrangement with stigma  there was a ==horizontal competition for backwardness== without any stigma ![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044735-8.png)- Perspective of ==MN Srinivasan== in below diagram :-

They are referred to as **dominant caste** due to large land ownerships.

- (zamindars, rich & middle class peasants, small peasants, tenants, sharecropper, labour)
- **Land Reforms** - With the emergence of land reforms there emerged a section who irrespective of their status in the traditional caste hierarchy became socially dominant due to land ownership,  numerical strength, and political power. ![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044733-7.png)

However, the opportunities were  not equally reaped by all which led to the emergence of ==class within the caste==

- **Reservation** - With the reservation policy, the lower caste people got access to higher education, govt jobs, and political participation thereby improving their secular status in the society
_Role of state_

    1. Caste-neutral job opportunities
    2. Urbanism - Heterogeneity & Anonymity -\> Secular pattern of living
    3. Rationality
 - The objective is to maintain the unity of caste and secure the uniformity of rules
- Caste councils (to ensure that caste rules are strictly observed).
- Disability and Privileges
- Occupational division of labour - Occupation is predetermined by birth and every caste is supposed to treat their occupation as a religious duty
- ==Commensality== (You are not allowed to interdine with people belonging to lower caste)
- Endogamy
- Hierarchy
- ==Innate nature== - you born and die in the same caste

    - Emergent forms of family - _Impact of Globalization on Joint Family_
    1. Structure
    2. Functions
    3. Interpersonal relationships
- _Emergent forms of the family_
    1. **Nuclear family with extended ties**
    2. **Single Parent Family:**
    3. Reasons-
        
        - Globalization
        - ==Secularisation==
        - Marriage is seen no more as a sacred institution 
        - Divorce is no more a taboo
        - Feminization of old age
        - Premarital sex is seen no longer a taboo for some
        - Economic independence of women
        - ==Surrogacy==
    4. **Female-headed Household**
        
        - Male-specific distress migration
        - Sologamy
        - With the change in the value system, the universality of marriage is getting questioned
    5. **Co habitation or Live-in -**
        
        - it is emerging as a threat to the institution of marriage as due to legal stringency and social stigma people don't want to go through the divorce process
    6. **Dual carrier family -** both husband and wife are working
    7. **Conjugal symmetrical family -** both have equal status in a marital relation
      
     
# Society Class 03
 - _The life cycle of the joint family_
    1. **Disintegration (JF -\> NF)**
        
        1. **Migration**
            
            1. **Push**
                
                - Agriculture distress
                - Population pressure on land is increasing
                - Decline in Village industry
                - Lack of alternative means of livelihood
                - Lack of basic infrastructure
            2. **Pull**
                
                - Industrialization
                - Globalization
                - Urbanization
                - Better opportunity and status for women
                - Better infrastructure wrt ==health, education, skill development==
                - Better standard of living
        2. **Land reforms and their impact:** 
            
            1. Means to evade land ceiling laws
            2. Legal provision reduces dependence on family for financial reasons
              
            
    2. **Reintegration** **(NF -\> JF)**
        
        1. Chain Migration==:== High cost of living + lack of ability to afford separate houses.
        2. Child rearing in dual-carrier families.
        3. Functional jointness is still retained due to the performance of physical and financial obligations. The family still retains joint family ethics ==for example participation in functions and ceremonie==s, hence we can say that in some cases joint households are getting disintegrated rather than the joint family.
        4. Industrialization==:== provides a financial basis to sustain a joint family
        5. Feeling of nativism
        6. Counter migration : due to lack of ability to economically sustain in destination areas, results in counter-migration. - Arena of conflict and contradiction: the value system not in sink with each other like cooperation vs competition, collectiveness vs individualism, delayed gratification vs immediate gratification.

|**Functions**|**Dysfunctions**|
|- ==Primary Socialisation==: i.e. early induction of child into the society's culture.<br>- ==Agency of social control== : the elders in the joint family keeps a check on the children and prevent them from performing a deviant act.<br>- ==Agency of social Insurance== : from each, according to their ability and to each according to their need.<br>- ==Economic cooperation== : prevents fragmentation of assets and secures economy of expenditure.(खर्चा कम होता है)<br>- ==Source of Identity== : Family provides the emotional and social support which acts as basis for identity formation of an individual.<br>- ==Value system== :- Cooperation ,collectivism, delayed gratification|- ==Lack of privacy==<br>- ==Lack of individualism==<br>- ==Low status of women==<br>- ==High fertility rate==<br>- ==Disguised unemployment==<br>- ==Self-alienation== : It refers to detachment from oneself. Family is considered as a nexus where each member is concerned about what others are thinking, feeling, or doing.<br><br>This nexus demands mutual concern and attention. It is believed that this process restricts the development of the self and results in alienation.<br><br>- ==Reproduction of social labour== : In a joint family set up children learn to conform and submit to authority, hence it leads to the creation of a submissive workforce.<br>- ==Us vs Them (Ghettoization)==: Ghetto is an area that is populated largely by members of a particular community and ghettoization (choudhrization of garoth) is the process that leads to it. (It can be due to social, cultural, and economic reasons).<br><br>The members of the joint family live in a family ghetto and they see the word in terms of Us vs Them.<br><br>- Competition, individualism, immediate gratification|
 
**Functions and dysfunctions of Family**
 
- ==Patrilineal==
- ==Patrilocal==
- Common sharing of property
- Commensality ==(Inter-dining==)
- Blood relations (more important than marital relations)
- Power is centralized in the hand of the oldest male member
- ==Common residence==
- Age and sex are the main ordering principles of the family hierarchy
 - _Features of typical joint family._ - According to Economic 2017-18, the child sex ratio is skewed in the favour of the boy child, due to patrilineal and patrilocal families.
- We are moving from ==patrilocal to neolocal.== - Due to globalization we are moving ==s==traight to serial monogamy.
- Marriage is no longer considered sacred, and the de-stigmatization of divorce and separation.
- Globalisation has led to secularisation, which led to a decline in the social significance of religion.

##### Impact of globalisation on marriage
 - _Types_
    1. Marriage
        
        1. Sologamy (It refers to self-marriage (the act of self-love) )
        
        Although this marriage has no legal sanction, it is a symbolic ceremony to emphasize self-love and independence.
        
        3. Monogamy (straight(one partner for life, no remarriage after death of a partner) and serial)
        4. Polygamy (polygyny and polyandry (1W and MH example ==khasa== tribe in HP, UK and ==toda== tribe of TN))
    2. Residence
        
        1. Patrilocal :- wife husband के घर जाती है
        2. Matrilocal :- wife stays at her own place and husband might visit her at her place.(==gharo==, ==khasi==, naayars tribe)
        3. Neo-local :- husband and wife living to a 3rd place (impact of globalisation)
    3. Ancestry
        
        1. Patrilineal - lineage from the father's side.
        2. Matrilineal - lineage from mothers' side (example: Garo, Khasi tribe of Meghalaya)
    4. Composition   
- When the family extends to 2 or more generations, it is known as a joint family.
- According to ==GP Murdock==, Family performs the following functions - common residence, economic cooperation, reproduction and sexual gratification.
- Family is defined as a social group consisting of people united by ties of blood, and marriage and adoption==.==

**Definition**
 - _Concept_

## Joint Family
 
# Society Class 02
 - Modernization is against only those values which are regressive in nature.
- Both Modernization and tradition(good and positive) can co-exist.
- Westernization per se is not wrong however in the name of modernization, restricting only to westernization is definitely wrong.
_Observations:_  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Parameter**|**Westernization**|**Modernization**|
|- Definition<br>- Scope<br>- Extent in the society.|- Refers to a blind imitation of the culture of the west.<br>- The scope of westernization is limited to clothes, food habits, music preferences, etc.<br>- The extent of westernization is limited to the elite section of society(Upper and middle class)|- Refers to a ==progressive== ==transformation== of social, political, economic, and attitudinal aspects of life.<br>- Modernization is the fundamental concept that aims to bring about **changes in values, attitudes, infrastructure,** etc. For example industrialization, urbanization, the modern education system, etc.<br>- Modernization is **a mass affair t**hat penetrates every section of society.|
 - However, what has been witnessed in the context of India is westernization.
- It was believed that with the forces of change Indian society would become modernized.

**Westernation and moderinzation:**
 - Urbanization which is driven by the principle of urbanism has 2 aspects :
    
    1. Heterogeneity
    2. Anonymity 
|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Traditional**|**Forces of change**|**Modern**|
|1. Status - The status that we acquire by birth. For example, based on gender, based on caste, etc is Ritual status and The status we achieve in our society based on our achievements is called secular status(achieved status).<br>2. ==Hierarchy== (its opposite is egalitarianism)<br>3. Strong ==religious== orientation - when religion is not only a matter of faith but governs social, political, and economic cultures of life. (Opposite of this is ==Rationality==)<br>4. ==Collectivism== (Opposite to individualism)<br>5. ==Particularism== _:_ It is characterized by "You show me the man, I show you the rule" (आदमी देख के बात अलग अलग प्रकार से बात होती है), Circumstances dictates how ideas and practices are applied i.e. Some people are more equal than others.(Its opposite is ==universalism==)|1. New social change:<br>    <br>    - Secular education.<br>    - ==English== language.<br>    - Printing technology.<br>    - Transport and communication.<br><br>-\> Dissemination of Ideas<br><br>3.

(with secular status)|1. ==Secular basis of status.==<br>2. Egalitarianism<br>3. ==Rationality== : is driven by scientific factors, logic, and facts.<br>4. Industrialization.<br>5. ==Universalism== : Everyone is equal and treated the same, that is ideas and practices can be applied everywhere without modification.|
 
### Impacts of British role on Indian society:
 - Based on the four basic attributes we can conclude that Indian society is a collection of multiple societies (it has a composite culture) - _A network of social relations based on patterns of interaction among the members is referred to as a society._

1. Joint family
2. Caste system
3. Patriarchy

3. Impact of British rule

1. Definite territory
2. Progeny (major source of membership of any society is through reproduction)
3. Common culture
4. Independent existence

1. Based on the pattern of interaction we tend to develop social relationships (teacher-student, work colleagues, friends, relatives etc.)

 **Consolidate the information regarding sections/subsections at one place!!!** #important

- In the absence of social empowerment, economic and political empowerment are meaning less.
- It refers to ==autonomy in decision-making and confidence== to bring about changes in the structures which has kept us marginalized over a period of time. 
### Social empowerment:
 - _3 aspects of a problem_ #important
    
    1. _Political empowerment_
    2. _Economic empowerment_
    3. _Social empowerment_
- Examples
    
    - Clothing ==-== jeans and kurta
    - Language - Hinglish
    - Cuisines - pizza burger, India chinese!
      
    
- Revival when international culture overtakes the aspects of local culture.
- Global culture taking local flavour for more social acceptability and extending its reach.
- Local+ Global culture.
_Hybridization:_  
- Effect on **Culture** ==- Homogenization, Hybridization, a revival of local culture.==
    
    1. Structure
        
        1. Sections
            
            1. Women
            2. Old age
            3. Youth
            4. PwD
            5. Child
        2. Institutions
            
            1. Family

        1. Homogenization
        2. Hybridization
        3. Revival of local culture
          
        
    
    - McDonaldization of food habits
    - Obsession with English language
- Effects on the structure-sections and institution. 
### Effect of globalization on Indian society:
 - It is believed that social problems and conflicts are caused because of this lag.
- ऐसे समझो कि समाज का value system बदलने में ज़्यादा वक़्त लगता है tangible (like technology, physical aspects of art etc) aspect से ।
- It arises due to a difference in the pace at which the tangible and non-tangible aspects of culture change.

**Cultural lag:**
 - Salad Bowl **-** It describes a heterogeneous society where different cultures are brought together as the salad's ingredients. However, the individual flavor is retained. _- this is mentioned to be promoted in the indian constitution._
    
    - E.g. India
- Melting pot **-** People of different cultures melt together, deserting their cultures and getting fully assimilated within the predominated society. (एक राष्ट्रीय पहचान में क्षेत्रीय पहचान का मिल जाना और खो जाना)
    
    - E.g. USA
- There are 2 schools of thought concerning multiculturalism, ==t==hat is melting-pot and salad bowl.
- People tend to retain, celebrate and transmit or pass the culture from one generation to another.
- There exist peaceful coexistence of diverse cultures.
- India is a land of diverse cultures.

**Multi-culturalism: peaceful coexistence of multiple cultures and religions**
 - Process of transition
- Collectivism
- Secularism.
- Unity in diversity. -
- Racial diversity.
- Ethnic diversity.
- Regional diversity.
- Religious diversity.
- Linguistic diversity.

**Diversity of India:**
 
### Salient features of  Indian society:
 
## **Content(broad outlook):**
 
1. Perspective - problem statement
2. Body - multi dimensions of the problem statement, what can be done
3. Solution - what is the best way to solve the problem.
 - To apply best practices of governance in the eradication of social problems.
- To sensitize the governments/public officials on discourses of Society.
- To develop a perspective on the Indian Social System. (that would determine what is the solution you are proposing for the social issues and problems) ![Why to Study Society To develop the perspective on...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044718-1.png)
