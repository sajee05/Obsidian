**The early form of colonization.**

- Goals were 3G: God, Glory, and Gold.
- In America and Africa.
-

- The intent of American Indian : Supported France. British victory means the loss of their territory.
- The intent of France and Spain : protect the colonies in Central America which were their major sources of revenue due to rich plantation system and hence vital to them.
- France and Spain feared that control of North America by Britain would put their sugar colonies of Central America at risk. 
**Results**

# World History Class 02
 
## American Revolution==:(1765-83)==
 - **Mercantilism :-** policies adopted to maximise the profits earned from the trade by merchants.
- With American Revolution(AR), 13 colonies of Britain in North America achieved independence and  established USA
- The US was the first republic in that era where countries were generally ruled by monarchs. 
**Reasons****:**  
**Long term reasons :** The policy of mercantilism of Britain (the goal of maximizing balance of trade)

- The set of policies adopted by Britain to maximize BoT are called British mercantilism;
- Mercantile capitalism or mercantilism--\> merchant is the trader of goods;
- British mercantilism in operation in 13 colonies;
- Mercantilism of Britain led to ==drain of wealth== from 13 colonies to Britain & the 13 colonies contributed to the industrialization of Britain;
- [Colonialism is a set of the unequal relationship between a colonial power & the colony;
- Here the colonial power intents to exploit the colony economically. Thus mercantilism is part & parcel of colonialism]
- High import duty on import of non-British goods;
- Certain raw materials can be exported only to Britain as mandated by British Parliament's law;
- As per the navigation act of 1651, cargo from British colonies can be transported out only in British ships;
- British Parliament said that the 13 colonies ==cannot establish indigenous industry== in the steel & textile sector;
- Therefore mercantilism implied misuse of legislative and executive power over colonies to economically exploit them; - **Short term reasons:**
- Proclamation of 1763 by British parliament barred expansion by 13 colonies to the  west of Appalachian mountains;
- They also created Indian reserve for American Indians to the West of the Appalachian mountains;
- Reason--\>American Indians continued to fight despite the loss to Spain & France in 7-year war;
- Britain was economically weak due to high war expenditure;
- It had borrowed money from the public to fund the war & now there were doubts that whether Govt will default on its borrowings;
- Therefore to end the war, Britain sought peace via proclamation of 1763;
- It had achieved its primary goal of bringing the whole of North America under its control;
- ==Stamp act, 1765== (by British Parliament for 13 colonies);
- It was a tax to be paid on all paper sold/purchased in the 13 colonies;
- The purpose was to recover the war expenditure of the 7-year war(1756-63)
- Result:  ==Stamp Act Congress 1765==--\>congregation or assembly of representatives of the colonies;
- A petition(formal request) titled as ‘declaration of rights & grievances’;
- We are loyal to the ground, however, British Parliament has no right to apply or levy taxes on people of 13 colonies since they are not represented in the British Parliament;
- (People in colonies did not have the right to vote, because they were not property owners);
- Therefore slogan of **No taxation without representation(NTWR)**
- (Aim was not independence, but no taxation without representation)
- This leads to boycott of British goods & uprisings in the town;
- Thus in ==1766, the Stamp Act was repealed== by the Britain Parliament.
- However, the boycott of British goods continues & British exports reduced to half;
- Because--\>colonies were demanding the abolition of all taxes(due to No taxation without representation) ;
- Britain withdrew all taxes except for tax on tea;
- Reason--\>Britain was withdrawing taxes, but not the right to levy tax;
- Hence kept the tax on tea intact;
- Britain want to assert that it is the sovereign power over the colonies; - **Boston Tea Party,1773:**
- In this incident the tea on a British ship harboured at Boston port was destroyed by some individuals of the Massachusetts colony;
- To punish Massachusetts, the British Parliament passed **coercive acts of 1774** called ‘Intolerable acts’ by the colonies which took away self Govt of Massachusetts;
- **Philadelphia Congress(1774)****--\>**1st constitutional congress;
- The colonies demanded:
- Repeal of coercive acts, ie., reinstate self Govt of Massachusetts;
- They reiterate No taxation without representation;
- To set up indigenous industry in all sectors;
- Preferential tariffs for British goods;
- Allow freedom in trade
- Britain attacks the 13 colonies
- Philadelphia congress petition considered as an ==act of rebellion==;
- The 13 colonies meet to make a declaration of independence;
- This leads to the ==American War of Independence(1776-83);==
- This ==AR seen in two phases(1765-83)==: -
- ==No taxation without representation(1765-1773)== &
- ==War of independence later(1776-83)==
- **Why did Britain lose?**
- France & Spain supported the 13 colonies with arms, ammunition & men;
- British encirclement campaign via Canada failed & this proved to be decisive;
- Britain was fighting the war in a faraway land(without local support);
- **Second Treaty of Paris(1783)****-** Independence  to 13 colonies;
- British retained Canada;
- Perpetual friendship established between USA & Britain;
- Spain gets back Florida;
- France did not gain anything;
- They established the USA in1789----\>Constitution of USA
- **Ideas of enlightenment thinkers:** 
- ==Locke==(1690)-Self Govt ; Right to Life,  liberty & Property, etc;
- ==Hobbes==: the idea of the social contract;
- A social contract is a contract between people and elected person;
- (Government was created through the consent of the people to be ruled by the majority)
- Other thinkers--\> ==Montesquieu, Thomas Paine==, etc;
-   
    
- **Assessment of AR: (Positive & Negative)**
- Positives: **It was Radical**
- No monarchy--\> 1st modern republic of the World;
- US Constitution has the world's oldest written national constitution still in use.
- Equality before law& Rule of Law--\>No special privileges for Nobility or clergy;
- There was right to property & there could not be deprivation of property without due process of law & without a just compensation;
- ==Bill of Rights,1791== gave certain Fundamental Rights to US citizens;
- They implemented the ideas of Enlightenment thinkers;
- **Criticisms(Negatives):**
- ‘All men are equal’--\>was not applied
- The right to vote was not given to women;
- Blacks & American Indians did not get citizenship & the right to vote;
- Only men of property got the right to vote;
- Slavery continued(Blacks were not freed from slavery);
- Westward expansion led to killings & loss of land for American Indians(Red Indians or native Indians);
- By 1856 property qualification was removed;
- Slavery was ended only after the civil war in the USA(1861-65);
- 13th Amendment passed which abolished slavery; #remember-for-later
- 14th amendment 1868--\>citizenship to blacks; #remember-for-later
- 15th amendment,1870 gave the right to vote to all Americans(other than women); #remember-for-later
- Only by 1920 women got the right to vote; #remember-for-later
- By 1924, American Indians got the right to vote; #remember-for-later
- (Native Americans could enjoy voting rights only now although the 15th Amendment,1870, granted all U.S. citizens the right to vote regardless of their race) - **USA CIVIL WAR(1861-65):** #remember-for-later
- Northern states (Union Govt ) fought against the southern states;
- **Reason**--\>**Abraham Lincoln** proposed to ban slavery;
- The economy of Southern states was dependent on slavery because they had an agrarian economy & slaves were source of cheap labour on farms;
- Also many in the South engaged in the slave trade;
- Thus the Southern states declared secession(independence) from USA;
- Result:-Union Govt won in the civil war;
- Slavery was banned==(==**13th amendment** ==passed)==

    - 2, Demands Manufacturing goods therefore of disposable income and increases in rising 
    - 3. Quest for new ideas of ==Renaissance== spirit (14th century led to focus on Logic and reason to resolve problems this led to a zeal for the quest for new ideas) 
    - 4. ==Democracy== was First to be established in England 
    
    - **4.1 English Civil war** 
        
        - Here Parliamentarians fought against King Charles I and the Principle that the king cant rule without of Parliament was established then in 1688 glorious revolution, Parliament change the King and supremacy of Parliament was established 
    - 5 Accumulation of profits from trade  
- 1.England was Island had protection from invasions this prevented destruction of wealth created and peace is very important for an economy to flourish 
- 2. Existence of Natural Harbours followed greater trade 
- 3. Britain was rich in natural resources like coal and Iron 
- 4. Good network of inland water tributaries allowed for inland water transport i.e. cheaper movement of goods within the economy  
- **Features of IR in England** 
- 1. The IR began in the textile sector in the textile sector and in fact it was the profit-making potential in the textile sector that began a cycle of innovation that compose IR 
- **Reason :** 
- EIC had a ==monopoly over trade with India== and trade in Finished cotton cloth was highly profitable for EIC, therefore booming demand of Indian cotton cloth in England therefore ==non-EIC businesses desired to manufacture finished cotton locally== to have a share in the local market 
- **Textile sector** 
    
    - Seed to fibre 
    - The spinning of Fibre to thread 
    - Looming of thread into cloth  - Machines were developed for each of these sectors later machines were deployed in other sectors  - **Process of Industrial Revolution (PISTA)** - Faster spinning Machines by ==Hargreaves, Arkwright and Crompton== 
- Faster Looms - Cartwright developed power loom that ran on Horsepower later modified to run on Hydropower and then on steam Power
- Cotton Gin is developed by Eli Whitney that separated Fibre 300 times faster than by Hand - Steam: 1769 James Watt developed Steam engine, applied to Spinning Machine, Power looms, to boats, ships, to move faster from coal mines, therefore, led to faster extraction of coal 
- Iron ==innovation of Blast furnace== led to the production of cheap IR and better quality steel and this boosted machine-building Industry 
    
    - 1. 1814: George Stephenson has deployed a steam engine to Railways this led to the development of the Rail network and in Britain and France.  Goods and labour now moved faster 
    - ==2. Macadamized roads== (Pakka Roads )
    - 3. Steam Engine deployed to ships and Boats plus Canal network was built
    - 4. This led to greater interconnectivity in the economy and established a Multi-modal transport network 
      
    
- **Agriculture**
- Changes took place which assisted Industrial Sector  - **1. Enclosure movement -** Such laws were brought by the Parliament that allowed Big landlords (Cornwallis 1786-93 belonged to big landlord family) to capture lands of small landholders and command lands in the village, This led to big landholdings and ended Land fragmentation and therefore allowed for economies of scale changed to Big i.e. in large scale production there is the low cost of production and more production per unit of Investment. 
- 2. Introduction of machines less labour was now required. 
- 3. Development of Irrigation Canal and better framing methods i.e. use of Fertilizers / Mnauring crop rotation etc 
- 4. Above led to the supply of cheap labour and now crash crop production increased, therefore, the supply of Raw material increased 
- A postal network was developed which led to faster communication and faster business transaction  
**Impact of Industrial Revolution** 

- 1. Britain developed an Industrial economy from an Agrarian economy 
- 2. GDP increased and Britain n Industrial economy while rest were far behind 
- 3. IR helped Britain develop stronger military 
- 4. Export of finished goods increased import of Raw materials increased 
- 5. Britain now emerged as a global power/superpower 
- 6. Mass migration from Rural to urban areas less labour now required in the Agri sector 
- 7. There was no crowding in the cities where poor workers lived in unhygienic conditions in slums 
- 8. Concentration of wealth and inequality increased in society 
- 9. Therefore free market economy there was protection to workers from the state and the wages were low, there was no social security and therefore workers were exploited with Child labour being Rampant and hours of work as high as 16-20 hours 
- 10. Negatives of Industrial capitalism led to the rise of socialism and Karl Marx give his communism by observing the exploitation of Workers by capitalists in Britain 
- 11. Workers began agitating against poor conditions of working for the right to vote e.g. Chartist movement of 1839-40 here workers demanded voting rights through a series of acts right to vote was expanded and by 1919 all masses above 21 got right to vote. 
- 12. laissez-faire decreased i.e. shift away from the free-market economy and now the state intervened in favour of workers or working classes movement increased e.g. 1824: the right to form trade unions 1802, 1812, two factory acts for better conditions of work maximum working hours, minimum age of employment etc  - **13. Impact on India** 
- Handicrafts sector:
- **1. Loss of Markets** 
- ==Britain Factory textile products== destroyed external and domestic markets for the Indian Handicrafts sector.
- Indian weavers produced better quality initially but lost in price competition and later in quality as well 
- Colonialism increased, therefore, transport sector revolution and faster capture of Indian market plus faster extraction, therefore, faster extraction transportation 
- Other industries impacted like Iron, glass, paper, melting, shipbuilding

# World History Class 07
 
**Blueprint for the class discussion**
 - ### **Colonialism in China**
    
- Cultural, political, and economic exploitation in china started after 1840 and it is known as the century of the Humiliation.
- Socialism in China. It started under Mao Zedong.
- Under Deng Xiaoping, the policy was changed in the economic sphere.
- Today China is communist (one-party system). However, China is capitalist in its economy.
- Rise of China.
- China in the cold war. 
**Colonialism in China**

- Disputed and important areas of China were explained with the help of the map.
- **Background**
- In 1514 the Portuguese discovered a new sea route to China from Europe.
- In 1557 Portuguese set up a trading centre a==t canton Port.==
- East India Company (EIC) set up in 1600 and began trade with China.
- By 1730 all European players were trading with China.
- The US, post-independence began trading independently with China from the 1780s onwards.
- European missionaries came along with traders to China to spread Christianity.
- Europeans were militarily stronger especially because of their naval power. This led to China following the policy of seclusion.
- Under the policy seclusion, China limited the contact with the west. It means it limited trade via thirteen Chinese traders and only via canton ports and China established no diplomatic relations with Europeans. 
**War Between Britain and China under the Manchu Dynasty**
 - **Reason for the War**
- **British Mercantilism:** In the 1800s Britain followed the policy of mercantilism in external trade. It means goals of maximizing profit by the positive balance of the trade, Export income and minimizing the import expenditure.
- However, with China, Britain had a negative balance of trade because China was rich and did not need anything from Britain. This led to a net outflow of gold from Britain to China.
- The British began the ==illegal opium trade== with China. This soon became an important tool ==to offset expenditure done on the import of Chinese goods by Britain.==
- Opium became a rage among the Chinese youth. This became a dispute between the Manchu dynasty and Britain. Manchu dynasty destroyed British opium in the ships harboured at the port. British Parliament sanctioned war against China citing the right to property of the British merchant. 
**Result of the 1****st** **Opium War 1840-42**

- China is forced to establish diplomatic relations with Britain as now Britain stationed an ambassador in the court of the Manchu dynasty. The purpose was to increase British political influence.
- ==Hong Kong was annexed by Britain==. The purpose was to have a solid base for the British trade with China.
- British sovereignty to be there in British trading centres. British law over the British citizens and not the Chinese law.
- In the economy more ports were open==. Preferential tariffs (Custom Duties) for the British Goods.== Freedom to trade with any trader in China. 
**2****nd** **Opium War 1856-60**

- It was fought betwee==n Britain and France== on one side and ==Manchu Dynasty== on another side.
- The main reason for the war was that the British and French wanted more favourable tariffs from China. They wanted more ports to be open up for trade.
- Between the two opium wars, similar treaties were signed by other European powers. Britain and France were demanding the legalization of the opium trade.
- The influx of missionaries increased after 1st opium war.

**Trigger Points**

- Some missionaries were killed and this was used as a reason by France to wage war on China.
- Some British and French officials who were demanding the legalization of the opium trade were killed in an incident.

**Result of the 2****nd** **Opium War**

- More ports opened for trade.
- Right to navigate (travel) in Chinese rivers to the foreigner, British and French businessmen, and goods.
- China was now internally opened up.
- More favourable tariffs were negotiated for the British and French
- Culturally Manchu dynasty was made to guarantee the security of the life of missionaries as they now got the right to travel inside China and establish Churches in China. Right to propagate Christianity.
- Opium trade was legalized (Ironical that on one hand there was religiosity and on the other hand this).
- In 1858 Russia threatens a weak China which was already engaged in the 2ndopium wars and annexed all Chinese territory above the r==iver Amur.== This forms most of the modern border between China and Russia. The border disputes were later resolved (in 2003).
- The purpose was that Russia wanted access to warm waters for its trade and later it established the port cities of ==Vladivostok== facing the sea of Japan/East China Sea.
- For China, it was a humiliation as neighbouring powers were using its weakness for their benefit. 
**Taiping Rebellion 1850-64**

- It was a rebellion by the Christian converts against the Manchu dynasty. They wanted to establish a heavenly kingdom of Peace with Christianity as the state religion.
- It proves the impact of missionary’s activities in China especially post 1st opium war 1840-42 and 2nd opium war 1856-60.
- It proves the weakness of the Manchu dynasty as the Manchu dynasty had to take the help of the warlords of China to end the rebellion. It means that the central government was on the verge of collapse because of its weakening by the foreign power.
- There was a loss of prestige for the Manchu dynasty. 
**1895 Sino Japanese War**

- Japan began industrialization after the Meiji restoration (1868)==.== By 1895 it emerged as a strong military power with territorial ambitions.
- Sino-Japanese War was mainly fought over Korea. Japan won the war and it was a humiliation for China. - **Result of Sino-Japanese War**
- Korea was made independent of China.
- Taiwan was annexed by Japan.
- Senkaku Island in the East China Sea was annexed.
- Japanese companies began their influence over Manchuria. 
**Boxer Rebellion of 1899**

- By 1899 China was divided into spheres of influence of the European powers. It means that a particular region came under the influence of a particular foreign power. Although legally these regions were part of China. Therefore the Chinese youth feared for the partition of their country among foreign powers. That is the sphere of influence getting converted into colonies of the foreign powers. Therefore hurting the territorial integrity of China.
- By 1899 many Chinese youths were influenced by the ideas of a modern polity like democracy, republicanism, and nationalism because of western education. Therefore they resisted foreign domination and lack of democracy in China.
- In the Boxer rebellion, they revolted against foreign powers in China. 
**Result of the Boxer Rebellion**

- US, Japan, Germany, Britain, and France sent the joint army and crushed the rebellion. Britain sent Indian Army.
- The queen was made to pay massive compensation in lieu of the war expenditure and damage to property of foreign businesses. It proves that during colonialism or a century of humiliation in China the central Government was weakened, China lost territory and its nationalism was brutally crushed and the Chinese were made to pay for it.
- Foreign powers got the right to station troops in China. Therefore the sovereignty of China was hurt.
- China was converted into an international colony. Under the leadership of the US, foreign powers agreed to adopt the open door policy. That means spheres of influence were ended and now the whole of China was available to all foreign powers for trade and business. All to respect the territorial integrity of China. 
**1904-05 Russo-Japanese War** #remember-for-later

- It was ==fought over Manchuria== which was a mineral-rich area. Thus it was of high importance for industrialization. Manchuria was a sphere of influence of Russia since 1858 Russia had also established a military base at Port Arthur in Liaodong peninsula near south Manchuria. Thus Japan envied Russia.
- ==Japan defeated Russia.== The whole world was in disbelief that an Asian country has defeated a European country. The reality was that an ==industrialized country had defeated a non-industrialized country.==
- Manchuria becomes a sphere of influence of Japan and Russians were removed from Port Arthur. With Russian out of the way now Korea is made a protectorate by Japan.
- Japanese victory boosted nationalism in Asian countries.
- Russian loss led to the ground for the ==Russian revolution of 1905.== - **Protectorate**: It implies that the foreign policy and military of a country come under the control of the other country by an agreement.
- China’s Humiliation was that it could only watch foreign powers fought for control over its resources. 
**In 1911 Republic** #remember-for-later

- Western-educated youth-led by ==Dr. Sun Yat-sen== allied with warlords to overthrow Manchu Dynasty.
- ==Sun Yat-sen== wanted a US-like republic with proper democracy while warlords wanted to get rid of the Manchu dynasty to have a freehand in the region and to maximize their powers.
- Once the republic was proclaimed warlords came into conflict with Dr. Sun Yat-sen who resigned and went into exile in South China. Warlords put a puppet (Yuan Shi Kai) in power, who declared himself as the emperor in 1915. He was overthrown by the warlords.
- Therefore from ==1916 to 1928, there was no central government in China.== This period is known as the ==Warlord Era==, where warlords ruled with impunity. There was no rule of the law and Peasants were exploited. 
**WW1 (1914-1918)**

- Japan captured Kia chow Island and the Shantung province of China that means Japan expanded westwards.
- This led to the May 4th Movement of 1919 where Chinese youth came out on the streets to protest the violation of the territorial integrity of China which had been the established principle since 1899 under the Open Door Policy.

**Washington Conference 1921** #remember-for-later

- The US and Britain were anxious about the increasing influence of Japan. Especially due to huge gains made by it in WW1. The Pacific Islands of Germany were taken over by Japan.
- Japan withdrew from Kiaochow and promised the territorial integrity of China.
- Japan agreed to limit its navy to 3/5th of the US and British navy.
- US, Britain, and Japan agreed to not build a military base within the striking range of each other. It was done the preventing any conflict.
- Japan gained that the US and Britain recognized its captured German Pacific Island as legally part of Japan. Thus it was again for Japan.

**The Topic for the next class discussion**: Colonialism of China will be continued.
 
# World History Class 08
 
**World History Class 08**  
**Kuomintang (KMT) and Chinese Communist Party (CCP): (Civil War)**

- ==KMT (1912) was established by Dr. Sun Yat Sen.== Its ideology was Pro-multiparty democracy and pro-capitalism. However, under Sun Yat sen the land reform was part of the KMT’s agenda.
- Sun Yat sen began a collaboration with Communist Russia (Russian Revolution took place in 1917) which provided arms ammunition, military training to KMT cadre/men. Russia hoped KMT in power would have a friendly nation in the region.
- ==Chinese Communist Party 1921== with communist ideology was formed that focuses on the eradication of the exploitation and concentration of the wealth in society. It believes in the end of capitalism and profit motives. In the 1930s Mao Zedong was its main leader.
- ==Chiang Kai Shek== took over the KMT after the death o==f Dr. Sun Yatsen in 1925==. He was radically anti-communist.
- From 1921 until 1928 when warlords were defeated by the KMT and CCP, there was peace between KMT and CCP. However, after establishing a republic and central government, KMT began persecution and attack against the CCP leadership. Therefore civil war began in 1921 and would continue until 1949.
- KMT began the “Encirclement Campaign” 1930-34. The KMT army tries to annihilate the CCP leadership however the CCP survives because of its Guerrilla warfare tactics.
- Besides CCP had the support of the masses and peasantry. CCP did land redistribution in areas that came under its control. Thus got support from the peasantry and its membership also increased.
- Japan attacked Manchuria of China in 1931 and created a puppet state/country of ==Manchukuo==.
- **Reasons**: Japan broke promises made in the Washington Conference of 1921 by attacking China.
-   
    
- **The reasons were as follows**: ==Great Depression of 1929==. The Great Depression of 1929 hurt the export-oriented economy of Japan as the demand in the whole world came crashing down. The factories in Japan started reducing the wages, laying off the workers, and cutting down on production. This led to rise in unemployment and consequent anguish among the poor workers.
- Thus with Russia in the neighbourhood, there was fear of communism in Japan. Besides that Chinese industrialists were beginning to threaten Japan’s dominance of Manchuria with the assistance of the Chiang Kai Shek. Therefore Japan could not bear a possible loss of dominance over resource-rich Manchuria and it attacked.
- Chiang Kai Shek continued to focus on the CCP rather than tackling Japan with full force. The Chinese army ultimately pressurized Chiang Kai Shek to make a truce with CCP and focus on Japan.
- Already Japan had further attacked North-East China in 1933. Therefore from 1936 until 1945, CCP and KMT fought against Japan. 1937 Japan attacked the whole of China. Thus the full-blown war began and this came to be known as the 2nd Sino-Japanese war which merged into 2nd
- After the defeat of Japan in 1945, the civil war resumed. USSR now supported the CCP while KMT got support from the US. CCP won the civil war because of the mass support and Guerilla tactics. CCP, therefore, came to control mainland China while KMT established government in exile in Taiwan under US protection. 
**Meiji Restoration (1868)**

- **Background**
- Japan was a small power in the backyard of China and it was always in awe of the might of China.
- It witnessed the decline of China at hands of European powers beginning in the 1700s.
- In the 1850s US threatened Japan to give up the policy of Seclusion and open up its economy for trade.
- Japan wanted to escape China like fate, therefore it did not oppose and opened up its economy.
- **Perfectors/States/Region**: Each of these was under the military nobles i.e. aristocrats. King was powerless. The economy was agrarian. It was like the Feudal society.
- In the 1860s, a group of military noblemen began a series of changes in polity and economics which collectively called the ==Meiji restoration.== 
**Reform under th****e Meiji Restoration**

- A group of military Aristocrats restored the political status of the Meiji (King) by defeating the rest of the military aristocrats.
- They established a Privy Council that was an advisory body that began ruling whole of the Japan in the name of the King. Therefore they established centralized rule in Japan.
- They sent officials to Europe to learn about the modern political system. This led to Japan enacting a ==constitution== that was a lot inspired by the Prussian/German constitution.
- They established a constitution provided for a Parliament called ==Diet==. However, the Parliament was weak and had a right to vote given to elites only. The executive was not responsible to the Parliament. The Financial power of the Parliament was not absolute.
- The executive was responsible to the Meiji.
- The Military also developed as an independent institution since it was responsible not to the government but to the Meiji.
- Therefore this constitution established a strong central government in Japan. 
**Changes in Economy**

- Japan wanted to industrialize like European powers. Therefore it sent officials to Europe and requested experts from Europe. The purpose was to import the technology, machinery, and learn about the capitalistic economy.
- Thus ==Japan began industrialization with help of the Europe.==
- There was no thriving private-sector therefore the state took the lead. PSUs were established.
- The private sector was simultaneously promoted by giving them economic benefits such as tax breaks and other assistance.
- Money earned or earnings from the export of agrarian goods to Europe and the US were invested in the industrial sector.

**Changes in the Education** 

- The focus was on having efficient blue color workers for the factories. Therefore the technical education was promoted.
- Extreme nationalism and worship of the Meiji was promoted.
- Focus on skilling was there.
- ==Education became the cornerstone of the Industrial Revolution== in ==Japan as it industrialized in just 30 to 40 years.== 
**Change in Military**

- The goal was to develop a strong centralized modern military.
- They ended the culture of the Samurai.
- The conscription that is compulsory military service was introduced.
- The modern military used to defeat the remnants of the Samurais. 
**RESULT**

- ==By the 1900s, the Japanese economy was an industrialized economy.==
- Japan was the 1st Asian country to be industrialized.
- Thus ==Japan escaped colonialism (Unlike China==) by first opening up to the west without resistance then strengthening itself with the above reforms.
- Like the Europeans, Japan also became an imperial power. 
**COLONIALISM IN AFRICA**

- Africa suffered from the earlier colonialism that began in the ==1600s onwards.==
- The tool of operation in this scenario was the ==slave trade.==(context)
- The Slave trade was continued for 300 to 400 years.
- There was the exploitation of its human resource.
- Export of Christianity, that w==as== cultural colonialism==.==
- Besides that land grabbing by the white settlers such as by Dutch in South Africa.
- 2nd phase of the exploitation was a product of European industrialization. It began from the 1800s onwards.
- The industrializing nations were hungry for raw material and export markets due to the race for industrialization and they wanted to catch up with Britain.
- Therefore the race for the colonies begins.
- Human resources continued to be exploited as European powers recruited armies from amongst the Africans for Europeans in WW1 and WW2. 
**Slave Trade**

- It was a ==triangular and trans-Atlantic slave trade.==
- The plantation system established by the Europeans mainly Spanish and Portuguese in beginning and later by Britain and France was highly profitable as agrarian products were exported from here and sold in Europe at high profits.
- Thus plantation economy was a core element of early colonialism.
- The climate of Central America was harsh and Europe did not have surplus labor. Therefore individual
- merchants began the slave trade they would capture blacks from West Africa and transport them in inhumane conditions across the Atlantic and sell them to the plantation owners in the Americas.
- Later slave trading companies also got formed to conduct the slave trade in an organized manner.
- It continued for 300 to 400 years and millions of Africans were uprooted from their home. 
**The topic for the next class discussion:** The colonialism of Africa will be continued.
 
# World History Class 09
 
**Colonization of Africa (Scramble of Africa) (contd.)**

- ==The 1870s: E==xplorers published about the wealth and navigability of the rivers in the internal part, which was regarded till now as a dark continent.
- King Leopold II has Congo as his private colony. This inspired European powers to look for establishing colonies.
- The whole of Africa was colonized between 1876-1914.
- The European powers needed raw material and export market for rapid industrialization and Africa was very rich in resources.
- However, they came up in conflicts between the European powers.
- Some were resolved through diplomacy, while others led to WW1. 
- ==Britain v/s France:== Egypt, Sudan, Niger river valley.
- France v/s Italy: Over Tunisia and Libya.
- France v/s Spain: Morocco.
- Portugal v/s Belgium: Congo river valley.
- Germany v/s France/Britain: Post 1870s the Germany industrialized rapidly.
    
    - ==Germany vs. France over Morocco.== Germany did not want France to dominate Morocco and was feared that France will extend influence over the Mediterranean sea and able to extend influence to the Atlantic.

- Germany anxious due to events regarding Morocco calls a conference where it is isolated as all other players supported France.
- Hence, Germany was isolated and had to agree to French control over Moroccan banks and police.
 
**Agadir Crisis (1911)**

- In violation of Madrid conference.
- France stationed its army in Morocco.
- Germany was already anxious after its isolation in the Moroccan crises of 1906.
- 1894: Russia and France made a military alliance against Germany.
- 1904: Entente cordiale. #remember-for-later
- 1907: Britain-Russia agreement over Afghanistan.
- Iran was trifurcated. North went to Russia, south to Britain, central as a buffer zone.
- Britain agreed to trade and investment in Russia.
- Germany captured Agadir island which raised the threat of war.
- Britain raised the threat of war.
- Germany isolated again and had to agree to France's control over Morocco and was given a small strip of land in the French Congo. 
**Britain in Africa**

- **Suez Canal(1859-69)****:** Very vital and directly connected Britain with India.
- Constructed by a company that had shareholdings of France and Egypt.
- 1875: Britain buy stakes in the Egyptian company.
- 1876: France and Britain took control over the budget of Egypt.
- 1882: The army of Egypt revolted against Br and Fr. Now, Egypt comes under control.
- 1904: Entente cordiale.
- 1922: Independence was given but the treaty allowed British troops in the Suez canal.
- Egyptian army resented British presence.
- 1956: Suez war. 
**South Africa**

- 1652: Dutch settlers colonized the Cape colony.
- Britain desired SA.
- ==1877: 1st Boer war.==
- 1899: 2nd Boer war.
- This resulted in Britain defeating Dutch.
- In 1910: Different provinces were brought together and formed the union. 
**Impact of colonialism in Africa**

- The Slave trade uprooted millions of Africans.
- White settlers became the elites and took over the lands, cultural suppression, racism, landless workers, etc.
- When blacks opposed, colonial powers engaged in mass killing.
- ==Absentee colonialism==: Lack of effective governance by the colonial power. No development in social infrastructure, etc.
- Arbitrary borders:  - **Ideal borders are including:**
- Cultural homogeneity (Language, ethnicity, religion) is important for national unity.
- Resources.
- Access to the sea.
- Geographical continuity/Geographical border is important for the movement of people and goods.
- Africa was partitioned on the basis of the power status of the European powers.
- Thus, different tribes came to live together and caused many issues.
- Series of conflicts between the tribes.
- Lack of development and geography, many African nations had single item export economy. 
**US imperialism**

- **Why late imperialism?**
- Geographically isolated, hence imperialism outside the continent would have been a very expensive affair.
- Need: the USA had huge domestic resources because of a vast area and a huge domestic market because of a rapidly growing population.
- Adopted liberal immigration policies.
- Hence need for colonies was not there for ==economic expansion.==
- Therefore, the USA had followed the policy of isolation under its ==Monroe doctrine under 1833.==
- Post-1783: the US was busy with the domestic front.
- ==Initially, territorial expansion to the west.==
- ==Industrialization.==
- ==US civil war.==
- Hence, no did not become part of the European conflicts.
- **Monroe doctrine:** ==Policy of isolation.==
- Implied that the USA would stay out of the European affairs, conflicts and EU powers should not interfere in Americas.
- The isolation was not absolute and it did engage in trade with countries.
- Like with Japan, China, Europe, etc. 
**Why Imperialism? (post-1880s)**

- By the 1880s USA, the economy was industrializing rapidly and now it got confidence in the establishment of domination in its backyard.
- Claiming areas in the Pacific as far as Hawaii and Philippines and hence, the notion of Backyard expanded as the power expanded.
- 1898: Spain vs the USA, Cuba of Spain became a USA protectorate.
- Puerto Rico, Hawaii, etc. were annexed.
- The reason was mainly Geo-Political including the domination of the Pacific.
- ==Boxer rebellion 1899:== When the USA's economic interests were hurt, the same engaged militarily as well.
- Here also the USA implemented an open door policy.
- Panama Canal constructed in 1914:
- The utility was huge for the USA as it allowed greater connectivity.
- Panama was part of Columbia. The USA had issues with Columbia.
- A revolution was manufactured and a new country of Panama city was created.
- Better deal/concessions for the USA. 
**The topic for the next class: World war I, etc.**
 
# World History Class 10
 
**A brief overview of the previous class was provided**
 
**World War I (WW1):**

- (Sir showed a map highlighting European Countries before & after WW1)
- **Background**--\>WW1 was fought between:
- ==Central powers==(Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria) &
- ==Allied Powers==(Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal, USA, Russia, Japan, Italy)

**Reasons for WW1:**

- **Austria-Hungary & Serbia** --\> Serbian Nationalism desired the creation of Yugoslavia by merging all territories populated by Slavs in the Balkan peninsular.
- Problem was that the Habsburg empire(Austria-Hungary empire) was a multi-ethnic empire & it had Slavs, Germans, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, etc;
- Therefore the creation of Yugoslavia would have meant a loss of territory for the Habsburg empire.
- Also, it would have set a precedent that would have threatened the territorial integrity of Austria-Hungary as other nationalities would also demand secession. - **Russian concerns** --\> National interest of freedom of navigation via Straits of Dardanelles which provided Russian goods exit from the Black sea;
- The straits connected the Black sea with the Mediterranean; - **Ottoman Empire**(called the sick man of Europe because it was a weak empire)
- It was an old rival of Russia;
- E.g.: In the Crimean war(1853-56) Russia had tried to annex the territories of the Ottoman Empire.
- But it was defeated by France & Britain who came to the aid of the Ottomans.
- This was to ensure a balance of power created by the Congress of Vienna of 1815.
- [**Congress of Vienna**--\> Its objective was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars]
- Ottoman lay on East of Straits of Dardanelles;
- Germany via Austria-Hungary was trying to increase its influence in the Balkans.
- Success would have led to the possibility of Germany, Austria-Hungary & the Ottomans choking Russian trade.
- Therefore Russia supported its ally Serbia, which was also a Slav nation for influence in the Balkans;
- **Concerns of Germany**--\>The anxiety of being encircled by Russia, Britain & France.
- France & Russia had a military alliance against Germany since 1894;
- Britain & France signed a Treaty of Friendship in ==1904(Entente Cordiale);==
- Britain & Russia resolved their dispute via a treaty in 1906;
- Therefore ==Germany felt encircled==.
- Also, Germany was being isolated in Colonial disputes against France especially in Morocco.
- Eg: Moroccan Crisis (1906), Agadir crisis(1911);
- Therefore Germany developed a belief that only a war victory can help it achieve dreams of a colonial empire suited to its power status;
- It was 2nd power in Europe & was rapidly catching up with Britain. - **Germany-Britain rivalry**--\>it was a naval rivalry.
- Germany was expanding its naval power.
- This made Britain anxious as with a superior navy Germany can in future threaten the colonial empire of Britain.
- Therefore Britain supported France in the Germany-France rivalry.
- **Germany France rivalry**--\>Alsace Lorraine(coal-rich area) was annexed by Prussia in 1870;
- Also colonial rivalry between them.
- These frictions manifested in events in the run-up to WW1. 
- There were pre-World War I groups:-
    
    - **Triple Entente** ==--\> Britain, France, Russia;==
    - **Triple alliance** ==--\> Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy==
- [Mnemonic to remember---\>Mereco Bru coffee peete hue Boss ne 11 baar apne 12 13 BAlko ke Saath ACCHe se Maara;
    
    - ==Moroccan crisis;==
    - Britain Russia agreement 1907;
    - Bosnian Crisis 1908;
    - 1911 Agadir crisis, Libya of Ottoman Captured by Italy;
    - ==Balkan wars(1912, 1913);==
    - ==Assassination of Archduke of the Hapsburg Dynasty]==
      
    
- **Moroccan crisis** (1905-06, 1911)--\> It was over the status of Morocco.
    
    - Germany wanted to challenge France's growing control over Morocco;
- **Britain Russia agreement** (1907);

- **Bosnian crisis** was threatened by  Serbian Nationalism;
- Bosnian Hungary annexed Bosina from a weak Ottoman Empire which was Slav populated.
- This raised tension between Serbia which dreamed of Yugoslavia & Austria Hungary
- Russia called a conference, but was humiliated;
- Because Britain & France did not attend.
- They feared that Germany would go to war in favour of Austria-Hungary on this issue & they did not want a war;
- Now Russia began military build up so in future it could come to the aid of Serbia;
- Serbian animosity against Austria Hungary increased; - **Agadir Crisis** 1911--\>This increased rivalry between Germany & France-Britain;
- Also, Germany developed a belief that war is inevitable;
- **Libya** of the weak Ottoman Empire was annexed by Italy in 1911;
- In 1900 France had recognized special rights of Italy over Libya, if, Italy in return supported French claims on Morocco;
- **Balkan wars**(1912, 1913)--\>Balkan countries took away all territories of the weak Ottoman Empire in Europe(In Balkan peninsula);
- However, the rivalry between Bulgaria & Serbia began because of territorial dispute;
- Serbia emerged stronger;
- **The assassination of Archduke** of the Hapsburg Dynasty(Austria-Hungary empire)
- He was on a visit to Bosnia & was killed in a terrorist attack by Bosnians;
- This gave a reason to Austria-Hungary to wage war against Serbia & this got converted into WW1 as other European players joined either side;

**Why war between Austria-Hungary & Serbia got converted into a World War?**

- **Alliances in Europe**--\>Austria Hungary threatened Serbia with War;
- Russia decided to support Serbia in case of War;
- Germany threatens Russia that Germany will support Austria-Hungary if Russia supports Serbia.
- Germany declared war against Belgium, France, Russia, Serbia after bringing Ottoman Empire into an alliance; - **Reason**--\>**Schlieffen plan** ==of Germany;==
- Also, Germany believed that France will come to the aid of Russia because of the 1894 alliance;
- (Schlieffen plan--\>It was a German military plan which aimed to defeat France in 6 weeks & therefore end 2 front war)
- This was by attacking France through Belgium;
-  Britain entered the war as it had a military alliance with Belgium;
- Japan entered the war because it was an ally of Britain & it also wanted the German Pacific Islands. - **The tragedy of Miscalculations**:
- Germany thought that Russia would finally not come to the aid of Serbia if Germany promises support to Austria-Hungary;
- All nations thought that the mobilization of the military would not lead to war;
- But in reality, mobilization increased the risk of war ;
- Germany assumed that France will come to aid of Russia & declared preemptive war against France.
- Germany assumed that Britain won’t come to aid of Belgium; 
**Important events during WW1:**

- **Trench warfare**==--\>T==here was no quick victory for Germany because Schlieffen plan failed due to stalemate created by trench warfare in France;
- (Trench mean pits, a long narrow ditch) - **Impact:**
- The 2 front war continued for Germany.
- Which meant that the longer the war lower the chances of German victory;
- The tragedy of life in the trenches;
- There was no hygiene, rains etc.
- So they became fertile ground for diseases.
- It is alleged that Spanish flu took root in trenches.
- Later books were written on the miserable life of soldiers in the trenches; - **Belgium was crushed by Germany;** 
- Russia faced brutal defeats at hands of Germany leading to the Russian Revolution of 1917.
- This Russian Revolution led to the overthrow of the Czar in Russia & the Bolsheviks/Lenin’s party seizing power.
- The Bolsheviks believed that WW1 was a result/product of Capitalism, ie., greed for colonies & people wanted an end of the war.
- Therefore Russia exited WW1 in 1917 v==ia the== Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (also known as the Peace of Brest in Russia) - **Entry of USA(1917):** 
- **Reasons** for giving up the policy of isolation & entering WW1:
- The German navy was defeated by the British by 1917
- (Important battle was Battle of Jutland 1916);
- Therefore Germany stated unrestricted submarine warfare.
- i.e., attacking surface ships without regard for whether these were British ships or not.
- This led to the destruction of some USA merchant vessels.
- **Zimmerman plan**==:== --plan by Germany to instigate Mexico to wage war against USA;
- So that the entry of the USA on side of Allied powers is delayed.
- Germany knew that USA would enter WW1 because of unrestricted submarine warfare.
- When USA came to know of Zimmerman plan--\> it increased its anger against Germany;
- **Impact:**--Now the Allied powers had huge resources of USA, of colonial Empire of Britain on one side & Germany on the other.
- Therefore this ensured German defeat. 
**Result of WW1:**

- Allied powers emerged victorious.
- **Russian revolution** of 1917 & becoming Communist country;
- (Russian Revolution, Communism, etc., will be covered in later classes)
- (Communism refers to a system in which goods are owned in common and are available to all as needed)
- (Socialism refers to an economic and political system where the state owns the means of production)
- Russian Civil war(1918-20)--\>Bolsheviks/Lenin had seized power by dissolving the constituent assembly formed after the October Revolution of 1917.
- Now other political parties with their supporters began fighting against the Bolsheviks; - **Reason** for Civil War in Russia:
- By surrendering to Germany & signing the ==Treaty of Brest-Litovsk(1917)== Russia lost many territories to Germany like Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Ukraine, Georgia, etc.
- Therefore it was a very harsh Treaty for Russia;
- Britain, France, the USA, Japan send their armies to Russia,
- The Allied powers wanted to remove Bolsheviks from power to make Russia re-enter WW1 to re-establish 2 fronts against Germany.
- Another reason was that Britain, the USA, France, Japan did not want a communist Russia.
- Therefore wanted Bolsheviks out of power --\> fear of Communism.
- **Japan** captured the ==German Pacific Islands==, Kiaochow Islands & Shandong province of China;
- Chinese youth revolted via the May 4th movement.
- The USA, Britain intervened via the Washington conference 1921 which led to:
- The cap on Japanese Navy in the ratio(==5:5:3==--\>USA:Britain: Japan)ie., Japanese navy will be three-fifth the size of USA-British Navy;
- Japan exited Kiaochow & Shandong;
- Japan got recognition for the German Pacific Islands as its territory;
- Japan, the USA, Britain won't build a military base within striking range of each other. (for peace in the pacific)
- They agreed to the territorial neutrality of China;
- **Ottoman Empire got disintegrated** & it was reduced to just Turkey;
- Colonies of losing powers were taken over by victorious powers, (especially France, Britain, Japan).
- **Italy was disappointed** as it was not given the promised Ottoman territory
- They had joined Allied powers for this.
- **Colonies did not get independence** & Allied powers fought only for liberating their territories from the German occupation;
- Arab areas of the Ottoman were taken over by Britain & France.
- (France-Syria, Britain-Palestines, Transjordan, Iraq); - **India** got Govt of India Act,1919 which was a disappointment;
- Indians had supported Britain in WW1 effort in hope of some real self–Govt;
- Jallianwala Bagh massacre;
- (Khilafat movement in India)
- Muslims of India were promised lenient treatment to Khalifa (who was the ruler of the Ottoman Empire & religious head of the Muslim world).
- However, the ==Treaty of Sevres== reduced the Ottoman empire to a small country.
- Therefore this led to the Khilafat movement in India(1919-25).
- German South-West Africa was given to South Africa;
- German East Africa is given to Britain;
- Cameroon was given to France;

**Next class---- Treaties post WW1, Treaty of Versailles, etc.**
   

### IMPACT OF WORLD WAR

- **German Revolution 1918-19:**
    
    - With losses piling up Kaiser had to abdicate the throne ==an==d went into exile. ==Socialists== formed the government in Germany. They surrendered in 1918.
    - They represented Germany in the ==Treaty of Versailles.==
    - They drafted a constitution for the ==Weimar Republic== (the city where the constitution was drafted.)
- **Treaties signed**
    
    - Treaty  of Versailles  with Germany
    - Treaty of Sevres with Ottoman
    - Treaty of Saint Germain with Austria
    - Treaty of Trianon with Hungary
- Note: Just before World War 1 Austria and Hungary was separated
 
**VERDICT OF THE WORLD**

- It was humiliating because Germany was made responsible for World War I==. In reality,==
- It was colonial rivalries, Naval rivalries, Nationalism e==.g.== of Slavs, and other factors like the encirclement of Germany and Russian anxiety regarding the strait of Dardanelles, etc which were ==responsible for WW I==.
- TOV was harsh: only Germany was disarmed, German lost the ability of Self Defense.
- **Economist Keynes had determined** 2000 Million Pounds as the right amount for reparations therefore 6600 million pounds was harsh.
- Therefore, the real purpose of France to keep Germany permanently economically weak so it could never threaten France.
- Principal of Self Determination was not followed for:
    
    - Many Germans lived outside Germany post treaties of Versailles. E.g. SAAR, Danzing, Sudetenland.
    - The new Austria had the majority of Germans but TOV barred the union (Anchulus). France did not want German to become strong
    - It was followed for Non-Europeans i.e.. Colonies **didn't get Self-determination/Independence**
- Russia did not gain much even when it was devastated by Germany. It did not get back territory lost in the harsh treaty of **Brest-Litovsk  1917.** was not made a member of LON, the communist government was not recognized by capitalist nation, not even invited to peace treaties.
- Peace treaties failed to buy peace in short term even in the immediate short term e.g. Italy felt cheated because was not given the promised territories and Mussolini who came to power in 1922 adopted aggressive foreign Policy e.g. threatened  Yogoslavia with war and bombed Greece when an Italian member of a team of LON investigating Boundary dispute of Greece and Albania, was killed.
- Mustafa Kamel fought and defeated Greece, pushed them out of Turk populated area.
- The demilitarization of Rhineland was humiliating and was against the sovereign right of Germany to defend all of its territories
- The disarmament of Germany led to Germany losing the ability even maintained domestic law and order.
- Germans were not allowed to speak in Peace Treaties
- Hitler won't have to come to power in Germany if TOV had not been so harsh and humiliating. TOV was a major component of Hitler’s propaganda against the Weimar Republic and France
- The distribution of colonies from losing powers to victorious powers proves that WW 1 was fought not for liberty but for colonies.
- Imperialism continues
 
- Creation of Nations based on Nationality
- Republic in Turkey
- Nationalism among the colonies increased because of the stress of Democracy, Germany was having Kaiser; Austria -Hungary under Monarchy; ottoman having no democracy;
- Allied Power: Czar was overthrown; USA, Britain, France were democracies
- The attitude of the Public towards War **became negative post-WWI**
 
- League of Nations was created by TOV and it came into effect in 1920. 
- **What it was?**
    
    - It was an international organization functioning on basis of the League Covenant (like UN charter i.e. Preamble)
    - It had a security council with 4 permanent members and some Non-permanent members.
    - France, Britain, Italy, Japan (Permanent)
- **Why was it created?**
    
    - To maintain world peace by resolving international disputes/preventing War and via collective security i.e. collective security ie. all members to defend the victim nation and punish the aggressive nation.
    - It also engaged in social work e.g. welfare of refugees, the welfare of workers.
- **Impact**
    
    - Collective security was diluted as in the early 1920s contribution of the Army was made voluntary
    - LON did not have its own army/military.
    - Failed to curb aggression of Japan, Italy, Germany and therefore shares responsibility for failing to prevent World War II.
 
- **Period of turmoil: 1919-24**
    
    - Italian Aggression
    - Turkish nationalism
    - Weakening of LON’s collective security, 1923
    - Occupation of French of Ruhr Industrial reason, 1923
    - The pressure of the USA on France,
- **Positive Periods 1924-29**
    
    - The US realized that France is indeed dependent on reparation to pay back the loan
    - Dawes Plan 1924 : cheap US loan to Germany
    - Locarno Treaty 1925 : some recognition to borders created by TOV + increase peace
    - Kellogg's-Briand Pact: Made war illegal
    - Young Plan 1929: Decreased war reparations
    - Great depression 1929
    - Rise of the Hitler
 
- **1-Treaty of Versailles:**
    
    - War reparations;
    - Disarmament of Germany Loss of territories(within Europe & outside Europe-Africa & Pacific Islands)
- **2-Treaty of Sevres(Ottoman)**:
    
    - Loss of territory-Turk territory to Greece;
    - Arab territory to France, Britain;
    - Khilafat movement in India; Turkey becomes a republic;
    - Removal of Greece from Turk areas;
- **3-Treaty of Saint Germain & Treaty of Trianon**(Aus+Hungary);
    
    - Loss of territory-Small Hungary, small Bosnia;
    - New nations are born;
- **4-Arrival o****f new nations:**
    
    - ==Czechoslovakia==;
    - ==Yugoslavia==--by Serbia, Montenegro, some territory of Aus-Hungary empire;
    - ==Poland== creation--Some territory from Russia, some from Germany(Polish corridor)
    - Treaty of ==Brest-Litovsk --\> Germany & Russia treaty;==
    - This treaty along with the Treaty of Versailles leads to th==e creation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland;==
- **5 - League of nations born** with the goal of collective security;
    
    - USA, Germany, Russia not part of it;
- **6 - Russian Revolution of 1917--\>**Russia became Communist;
    
    - Also Russian Civil war(1918-1920)
- **7 - Creation of Weimar Republic--\>** In Germany;
- **8-Imperialism**(or colonialism) continued;
- **9-In East, Japan became powerful**;
    
    - Japan got Pacific Islands;
- **10-Rise of Mussolini** in 1922;
 
- **French occupation of Ruhr industrial region**(1923);
    
    - **Reason:**
        
        - USA was exerting pressure on France to pay back US loans taken to fight WW1;
        - France was dependent on war reparations from Germany for reconstruction post-war & to pay back US debt;
        - By 1922 Germany defaulted on war reparations;
        - This led to Belgium & France attacking Germany & occupying the Ruhr industrial region of Germany.
        - It was an important source of supply of goods; 
    - **Impact:**   German workers began passive resistance,
        
        - i.e.., they refused to manufacture goods for the French to take away;
        - The sudden crash  in supply led to hyperinflation in Germany;
        - (Hyperinflation refers to the rapid, excessive, and out-of-control general price increases in an economy.)
        - Therefore German economy which was already weak came crashing down
        - Humiliation for Germany as not even for WW1 the foreign Troops set foot on German soil
        - 1st failed attempt by Hitler via Munich Beer Hall Putsch(Coup);
        - The crisis led to US intervention;
    
    - US realized that France was indeed dependent on war reparations from Germany to pay back USA debt;
    - USA's economy by now was decently interlinked with Europe via trade & investments;
    - Therefore it could not afford a crisis anymore; 
- **Dawes** **plan**(1924):
    
    - End of political crisis by France & Belgium withdrawing from Ruhr industrial region;
    - The plan involves the US giving cheap loans(Low-interest loans) to Germany which helped Germany economy to recover; 
    - It was decided to allow Germany to pay to France such amount in war reparations annually which it can afford to pay
        
        - --(But overall has to pay still 6600million pounds);  
    - Over time it was expected that over the years, Germany economy will recover.
        
        - --Thus France will get war reparations helping France recover & payback US loans;
    - USA exports to Germany will increase when the German economy recovers; - **Locarno** **treaties**(1925):
    
    - **Background:**  the Dawes plan(1924) created a positive political atmosphere in Europe & specifically between Germany & France;
    - This paved way for converting good economic cooperation into good political relations;
    - This phase is also called the Locarno honeymoon between France & Germany as their leaders met frequently;
    - **Provisions of this treaty:**
        
        - **1.**Britain France guaranteed borders of Belgium;
            
            - --(Britain & France pledged to come to the aid of Belgium if its territorial integrity is threatened);
            - --Also, Germany agreed to borders of Belgium;
        - **2.** With Respect to Poland--\>France guaranteed borders of Poland
            
            - --But Germany did not recognize the borders of Poland, Czechoslovakia.
            - --However, they promised to follow arbitration to resolve border disputes;
            - --Therefore it was a step towards peace in Europe;
        - **3.** Germany agreed to keep Rhineland demilitarized; - **Kellogg Briand pact** (1926)--\>also known as Paris peace pact;
    
    - Kellogg(from USA) & Briand(From France)
    - This made war illegal;
        
        - ie., signatories to the pact agreed to not have war as a tool of foreign policy.
            
            - --(They renounced war.)
    - **Positive--\>**Most of the nations signed it;
        
        - --Therefore an important step towards peace.
    - **Negative--\>**It was a paper tiger because it did not have any collective security clause or any clause that committed signatory nations to compulsorily act against the aggressor;
        
        - Eg: Fascist powers like Japan broke the pact but went unpunished; - **Young plan**==(1==929):
    
    - Dawes plan(1924) had kept the amount of war reparations unchanged at 6600 million pounds;
    - Young plan(1929) by the USA led to the decision that:-
        
        - **a.** Germany to pay 2000 million pounds;
        - **b.** In 59 years;
 - **Great Depression** ==(1929):==
    
    - **1.** 1920s US economy grew rapidly;
    - **2.** Stock market was booming;
    - **3.** Common man had high exposure to stock markets;
        
        - --Some had put all their savings in stock markets;
        - --Many had even taken loans to invest in markets;
    - **4.** Post the mid-1920s the real economy began contracting, but the stock market kept on making new highs;
    - **5.** This led to huge divergence in the economy and the stock market;
        
        - --There was no regulator for the markets leading to unabated speculated behaviour;
    - **6.** Finally in October 1929, there was Wall street crash & common man lost all his savings;
    - **7.** This decreased the economy;
        
        - --The factories decreased production because of decreased demand;
        - --They decreased wages & laid-off workers;
        - --This further decreased demand in the economy as unemployed workers did not have any social security in the form of unemployment allowance;
        - Therefore a vicious cycle got setup;

- **Wall street crash got converted to Great depression 1929:-**
    
    - US economy was highly interlinked with the world economy;
    - Exports of countries to the US came crashing down;
    - German economy crashed because it was dependent on US loans & now the US would not give any further loans
        
        - --USA also demanded short term loans back;
    - The French economy was dependent on reparations from Germany.
        
        - --Therefore it also crashed; 
    - The Japanese economy was an export-oriented economy because its own domestic market was small(because of the low population);
        
        - --Therefore because of decreased demand in the rest of the world its economy also came under trouble;
        - --(Export-oriented economy refers to a country where international/foreign trade makes up a large percentage of its economy.) - **Impact of Great Depression 1929:**
    
    - **1-Policy of appeasement** (1929-39);
        
        - Because of the struggling economy, the world powers like the USA, Britain, France did not want a war.
        - So they tolerated the aggressive behaviour of Fascist countries like Germany, Italy & Japan;
        - This is referred to as appeasement which boosted confidence & popularity of Fascist leaders;
    - **2-Rise in popularity of communism**;
        
        - Because of the failure of capitalism in form of the Great Depression of 1929;
    - **3-Rise of fascism**;
        
        - Hitler came to power;
        - Japan came under military rule;
        - Because of the crisis, the existing Govt became unpopular & there was a rise of radical leaders(Fascist rulers);
   
 - **1932-33:** **World Disarmament Conference (WDC)**
    
    - It was organized by the League of Nations (LON).
    - However, it failed to achieve its objectives of disarmament.
    - It had the following repercussions:
        
        - Japan withdrew from the League of Nations.
        - ==Hitler withdrew from WDC and the League of Nations.==
        - Hitler exited the conference.
        - The exit of Hitler gave a clue that in his opinion it was a biased conference.
        - He had demanded universal disarmament or Germany-France parity in the WDC Agreement.
- **1933: Signing of Pact between** **Italy and USSR**
    
    - Reasons why USSR signed the pact:
        
        - The pact was signed as a consequence of the threat of Nazism.
        - The rise of Hitler and the possibility of aggression by Germany in near future.
        - Hitler hated the Communist ideals, hence this threatened USSR.
- **1934****:** **Re-armament of Germany****.**
    
    - Hitler introduced re-armament in Germany.
    - By re-armament, Hitler wanted the destruction of the Treaty of Versailles.
    - This treaty was considered a humiliation on the aspirations of Germany.
    - After Hitler broke away from the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations did not act.
    - This started the appeasement of Hitler by Britain, France, and the USA.
    - 1934: The USSR was offered entry into the League of Nations.
    - This was seen as bonhomie between USSR (communist) and the Capitalists because of a common enemy (Hitler).
    - **This was done for the following reasons:**
        
        - To reduce animosity between Communist and Capitalist ideologies.
        - It was required because Europe was threatened by the rising of Hitler.
        - This led to the improvement of relations between Communist Russia and Britain, France, Italy. - **1934:  Signing of Non-aggression Pact between Germany and Poland.** 
    
    - This was considered as Germany’s Master Stroke due to the following reasons:
    - This broke the Little Entente.
    - By this Poland was not to be attacked by Germany.
    - Poland signed this Non-aggression Pact because it did not have faith in Little Entente.
    - Its lack of faith was due to various factors such as
    - lack of trust for Britain and the US,
    - apprehensions due to the Great Depression, etc.
    - Poland signed the Pact because it feared attack by Hitler.
    - This was considered as a victory for Hitler, because if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, Austria, etc. then Poland won't act.
- **1934: First Attempt at Anschluss (Union of Germany and Austria).**
    
    - Events related to the attempt at Anschluss:
    - Germany incited the Austrian Nazis to a civil war.
    - The Nazis of Austria murdered Dollfuss (Chancellor of Austria).
    - Mussolini feared the consequences of the 'attempt at Anschluss' and sent troops to the Austria Italy border. - **Conscription in Hitler’s Germany (****1935):** 
    
    - Hitler began to construct an air force and unveiled plans to reinstitute conscription and create a German army.
    - He broke the Treaty of Versailles.
    - The conscription of Hitler alarmed the other European powers.
    - An alliance **Stresa Front** was established between Italy, France, and Britain.
    - **Stresa Front** opposed Hitler's violation of the Treaty of Versailles.
    - For the first time, Britain and France agreed to protect Austrian borders to prevent any future Anschluss.
    - It can be seen that the Policy of Appeasement was not followed in this case (Hitler was not appeased).
    - Anschluss event is an example of the same. - **Non-military alliance occurred between France and USSR in 1935.**
    
    - It was seen as a threat to Right-wing ideology.
    - Hence Right-wing saw strong Germany as protection against Communist USSR.
- **Further, the 1935 British-German Naval Agreement paved the way for German Naval conscription in the following ways:**
    
    - Germany was allowed to have Navy at par 35% of British Naval strength.
    - Germany was allowed to build submarines. (Although this violated the Treaty of Versailles.)
    - This agreement broke the Stresa Front, which angered Mussolini, and he began drifting towards Hitler.
    - The reason for Britain to sign the agreement was its lack of faith in organizations like the League of Nations.
    - Britain used the naval agreement as a ‘Carrot’ and the Stresa Front as the ‘Stick’. - **Annexation of Abyssinia by Italy in 1935:**
    
    - The following were the benefits of annexing Abyssinia (for Italy):
    - Colonial resources to fight Great Depression.
    - Avenging the defeat of Italy in Battle of Adowa (1896).
    - Mussolini was angered by the use of sanctions by Britain and France, to save the Stresa Front.

- **Further events in the Appeasement of Germany:**
    
    - Saar was given back to Germany in a referendum by the League of Nations (1935 event).
    - Anti-Comintern Pact was signed between Japan and Germany.
    - Rise in popularity of communism due to 1929 Depression.
    - Japan was threatened by communist Russia.
    - Therefore Japan was having a fear of communists.
    - Hitler also feared communists, his biggest opponents.
    - The genius of Hitler: By signing this Pact with Japan, he gave a projection that his main enemy was Communism/Russia.
    - This helped in signalling no suspicion to Britain and France.

- **Rome-Berlin Axis (1936)**
    
    - Italy and Germany suggest those countries who want peace, should revolve around Rome-Berlin Axis.
    - They should become (junior partners).
- **1936-39: Spanish Civil War**
    
    - A domestic war, law, and order situation.
    - It occurred between Right-wing and left-wing.
    - Basically, through the civil war, Communists wanted to establish communism in Spain.
    - The military opposed the same.
    - As a consequence of the civil war, Spain came under fascism.
    - Spain was helped by Italy / Germany.
    - The leader of Spain, i.e. Franco, gave Germany and Italy access to the naval bases in Spain, opening up in the Atlantic.
    - Mussolini sent troops to Spain.
    - Finally, he interfered in the Spanish civil war.
    - He sent his airplanes, killing people in communist areas of Spain. - **In 1937, Italy joined the** **Anti-Comintern Pact (1936).** 
    
    - The same year saw the **Japanese invasion of China**.
    - **A year later Hitler did Anschluss with Austria, which led to the following:** 
        
        - Nazis of Austria dominated Home Ministry.
        - They took over internal security.
        - When Austria's Chancellor attempted to save the country from Hitler's Anschluss, he was threatened by Hitler of invasion, hence he resigned.
- **The demand of Sudetenland a****t Munich Conference (1938):**
    
    - Hitler demanded Sudetenland, on grounds that Germans were discriminated against there.
    - Hitler was attracted to natural resources, heavy industries of Sudetenland.
    - Fearing war, Sudetenland was offered to Germany on assurance of no further invasion.
    - But by 1939, Hitler broke the Munich Pact and annexed Czechoslovakia.
    - British and France, following the policy of appeasement, stayed away from the German annexation of Czechoslovakia. - **This was the climax of the policy of appeasement.**
    
    - Germany also signed a Non-aggression pact with USSR in 1939.
    - They had secretly agreed to divide Poland. Germany eventually attacked Poland.
    - However, Britain and France came to defend Poland.
    - This is known as the full-fledged starting of World War 2.
    - Poland was defeated before any help from Britain.
 
- The policy was inaction towards Fascist aggression.
- It led to a rise in the popularity of Fascist leaders.
- Hitler demanded Danzig, Rail, etc. hence thought that demanding Poland was justified.
- Fascist leaders/Hitler gained confidence that Britain and France will not act at all.
- With the attack on Poland, Hitler did not intend to begin a war against Britain and France.
- Because Britain and France did not act when he breached the Munich Conference pact, then why they would act now?
 
- The policy of Appeasement led to the strengthening of the economic and military powers of Fascists.
- It boosted the strength of Fascist regimes.
- E.g. Japan / Italy gaining lands and territories.
- Making World War 2 more likely as Fascists deploy war as a tool of foreign policy. i.e. follow aggressive foreign policy.
 
- To avoid war, especially in the context of the Great Depression of 1929.
- Experience of World War 1: Millions of people died.
- Public pressure to avoid war.
- Anglo-German Naval agreement of 1935.
- Britain was sympathetic to Germany because of the harshness of the Treaty of Versailles
- Therefore Britain wanted to remove the cause of war itself that is the harsh clauses of TOV.
- If Britain helps Germany recover then there will be good relations and therefore peace.
- Failure of League of Nations:
- It is the failure of collective efforts to contain/prevent Fascist Powers.
- Failure of the League of Nations left little choice to individual nations and they had to follow appeasement.
- To buy time to get war-ready.
- Britain, France, USSR increased militarization (1933 onwards).
- Fear of Communism: Many political leaders saw strong Germany and Japan as a way to contain Communism and USSR.
- This contributed to the policy of appeasement and prevented the military alliance between Russia, and the capitalist West. 
- ==Failure of League of Nations== as it was created for world peace
- The collective security principle was never implemented due to the selfish interests of member nations.
- It was not a representative body.
- It did not have the USA, USSR, and Germany and was seen as an agent of Britain and France.
- Hence it lost its position as a neutral arbitrator.
- Th==e unjust Treaty of Versaille==s led to grievances.
- The Treaty of Versailles was responsible for the rise of Hitler in Germany.
- ==The Great Depression of 1929== helped Hitler to come to power.
- Hitler wanted to bring all German populated areas under his regime, by changing the borders created by the Treaty of Versailles.
- Hitler wanted to create ‘==Lebensraum==’, i.e. living space for future German generations.
    
    - For Lebensraum, he wanted to capture the far East, up to the Ural Mountains, and areas of French colonies in Africa.
 
- Word comes from the Italian Fascist Party.
- It was also used in the Rights of Man and Citizen of France (1784).
- Discussed the meaning of the symbol of fascism.
- **Principle underlying fascism:**
    
    - all members /institutions/classes of a nation should be united for the single-minded pursuit of making the nation great.
    - I.e. fascism is an ideology that is based on extreme nationalism. 
    - Usually, fascist powers do not shy away from using war as a tool of their aggressive foreign policy.
    - This ideology lacks thinkers in the conventional sense i.e. like socialism.
    - It depicts the action and policies of fascist leaders.
    
    - Belief in **strong leadership** - leading to strong executive and weakening of parliament.
    - The executive comes to have dictatorial powers. 
    - End of the system of checks and balances.
    - Establishment of a **Totalitarian regime**. 
    - That is total control over all sectors e.g. media, education system, economy, and over polity.
    - Thus elimination of any opposing view from society.
    - One **Supreme leader** has the onus of making the nation great. This leader is **charismatic**.
    - No independent media. No freedom of speech. The role of the media is to champion and glorify the leader.
    - **Indoctrination** of youth and children in favor of the leader. Changed syllabus, secret police, youth organizations.
    - **Extreme nationalism** is promoted by the media and education system. The idea of **sacrifice** for the nation is popularized.
    - Establishment of **One Party System**. All other parties are banned. 
    - The executive can give directions to the players/participants in the Economy. 
    - Establishment of **Corporate state**. Strikes by workers are banned. All trade unions are banned. Lockouts by capitalists are banned.
    - A state-led organization having representatives of workers and 
    - capitalists is set up to resolve disputes between workers and capitalists.
    - Directions can be given by the executive to industries. 
    - Therefore, there is a strong state which is pro-capitalism but neither PSUs nor free-market economy.
      
    

- **Economic superiority:**
    
    - self-sufficient economy, no unemployment, export-oriented economy, have food security.
- **Military superiority:**
    
    - larger expense on military preparation.
- **United nation:**
    
    - unity/fraternity among all sections.
- **Policy towards workers** :
    
    - Ensuring better wages and perks to workers, social security, **“After-Work” Organisation** for leisure activities. 
    - To compensate for the loss of political freedom.
    - SOPs to industries.
- **Price caps:** on food products to restrict food inflation.
- **Minimum Support Prices:** for the peasants.
- **Public Works Programs:** to address unemployment issues. 
- WW1, Treaty of Versailles: dissatisfaction in Italy as not gained much in the treaty.
- Poor economy, high unemployment, high inflation
    
    - **System of Proportional Representation:**
        
        - Led to political instability due to coalition governments.
        - Fear of Communism after communists came into power in Russia and spread of ideology in other countries including Italy. 
        - Rich section, King, and Church all worried about the rise of communism.
        - Mussolini starts opposing the communist party and slowly gains the popularity and trust of the propertied class. 
        - He pleased the king by dropping the demand of the republic.
        - He gained the trust of the Church by supporting Christianity as a state religion.
        - **March of Rome (1922):** with this Mussolini comes to power.
        - Mussolini brought **ACERBO Law (1923):** it ended the Proportional Representation system.
        - His party received a majority in the 1924 election.
 
- Made the PM responsible to the King only, not to parliament.
- Laws do not require the consent of parliament. 
- 10 million electorate was reduced to 3 million due to income criteria.
- One-party state
- Gave himself Title of **iL Duce**
- A corporate state or cooperative system was created bringing the economy under the executive.

- **Lateran Treaty (1929)** - Created a country - Vatican City, compensated the Church, made Christianity state religion,
    
    - in return the Church recognized Italy.
    - Changes in local government - no election henceforth, to be ruled by Governors.
    - Censorship - control over media.
    - Education is supervised to indoctrinate the children.
   

- A Hitler propaganda video was shown and features of Fascism and Nazism were discussed in that context.
    
    - German Revolution (Nov,1918-1919)
    - When Germany started losing in WWI, Kaiser went into exile, and socialists leaders, 
    - who represented Germany, surrendered to Allied powers and they signed the Treaty of Versailles.
    - Thus creating the Weimar Republic.
    - Weimar Republic - it was based on a **system of proportional representation**.
    - **November Criminals -** conspiracy theory by military generals who claimed 
    - that if Germany had not surrendered then Germany would have won WW1. 
    - This idea was utilized heavily by Hitler later to attack the Weimar Republic.
    - Since the Treaty of Versailles was humiliating and hurt the German economy, 
    - therefore, this fact would also be used by Hitler to attack the Weimar Republic.
 
- **Spartacist uprising (Jan 1919)** - An attempt by the working class to overthrow the Weimar Republic and establish communism.
- Due to disarmament by the Treaty of Versailles, the Government took the help of **Freikorps** to end the uprising.
- **Kapp Putsch (1920)** - attempt by Freikorps to overthrow the Weimar Republic. 
- Captured power but then communists did a mass strike which brought different parts of Germany and the economy to a standstill. 
- Kapp had to resign.
- Hitler’s Munich Beerhall speeches were mentioned at the end.
   

**RISE OF HITLER**  
**Munich beer hall putsch – coup**

- Trigger - French occupation of Ruhr – industrial reunion in 1923 of defaulting of instalments of war reparations.
- Action – Hitler and his Nazi party men saw an opportunity as French occupation was a humiliation and the German economy had also crashed.
- Therefore, he tried to annul Mussolini’s march on Rome of 1922 however, the police stayed loyal and Hitler was arrested.
- Hitler then used the trial for his propaganda where he attacked the treaty of Versailles and the Weimar republic govt which had signed it.
- Hitler became famous all across Germany because of media coverage and his brilliant speeches in the court.
- He was given a light sentence and was even released early that in 9 months
- In jail he wrote his Mein Kampf, i.e., my struggle – his autobiography.
- On release he expected huge crowds to welcome him but there was only a Nazi party car that received him**.**
- Reason – Economy improved because of Dawes’s plan thus people were not in the mood for revolution.

**3 Phases of Weimar Republic**

- 1991- 23 – Instability – separatist uprising, Munich beer hall putsch, Kapp putsch.
- 1924 – 29- Stability – The economy grew and so did the popularity of the Weimar republic.  Events – Dawes’s plan 1924. Locarno Treaties 1926.  Kellogg- Briand Pact 1928.
- 1929 –1933 - Rise of Hitler, the great depression of 1929, Hitler became chancellor in 1933. 
**Why the rise of Hitler / Fall Weimar Republic**

- Lack of Credibility for the Weimar Republic – it didn’t enjoy the confidence of the public.
- Anti-democracy sentiments – Germany had emerged to power as a top power in Europe under a strong and centralized system of government where the Kaiser and chancellor had most powers while parliament was weak.
- Instability 0f Weimar republic – Germany had adopted a system of proportional representation under the Weimar constitution which led to a series of coalition govts which were unstable.
- Parliamentarians lacked experience.
- Private armies – each political party developed their own army and political parties resolved their disputes by fighting on the streets. The treaty of Versailles had disarmed Germany and thus Weimar republic was unable to provide law and order stability therefore the popularity of the govt further decreased – violence in streets especially increased post 1929 (great depression)
- Communist and nationalist – both attacked the Weimar republic which decreased the popularity of the Weimar republic.
- Th==e Weimar republic failed to resolve economic problems sustainably== – From 1919- 23 it struggled to resolve issues of huge war reparations.
- ==Fear of communism== - Great depression 1929 was proof for communists that capitalism is unsustainable and has failed the poor section.
- Small peasants were the most hurt by the great depression thus the appeal of communism increased post 1929, all across the world and in India also there was the rise of socialist leaders like Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose etc.
- The communists blamed capitalism for WWI as it was rivalry for colonies which provided cheap raw materials and export markets for capitalists that led to WWI so the communist wanted an end to capitalism.
- Therefore, the bourgeoise i.e., industrialists and middle class and property owners supported Hitler as they saw him as a saviour from communism.
- Hitler’s abilities or charisma, he was a great orator, a man of unending energy and ambition and his propaganda was very effective especially in the economic context of post 1929 Germany. 
**Post 1933 Hitler Consolidated Power and established a dictatorship**

- Enabling law (1933) – It ended the Weimar republic as now for 4 years the government didn’t need consent of parliament for legislation.
- Laws that go against the constitution could be legislated and Hitler through fear and threat of SA and SS forced passage of this law.
- Hitler banned all other political parties i.e., established a one-party state. 
- In states/ provinces there will be governor rule and no elections will be there.  
- All political opposition, Jews were put in concentration camps, the plan for Jews was to work them to death, however as Germany began losing WW2, the final solution was implemented i.e., putting Jews into poisonous gas chambers i.e., mass massacre.
- Jews not just of Germany but of all captured areas were put into concentration camps, there was also mass migration of Jews away from German occupied areas.
- Gold from the teeth of dead Jews was melted for use by Nazi govt.
- Forced euthanasia for mentally unstable– Hitler believed in racial purity.
- Full control over the media.
- All labor unions were banned.
- Organization of German youth to brainwash them.
- Use of secret police to monitor educational institutions.
- Religion was brought under state control.
- Those who opposed Hitler were put to concentration camps.

**Hitler got more popular after coming to power**

- Declared 1930 as the year of no employment.
- Big schemes like MGNREGA.
- Large party bureaucracy like SA and SS. (SA- private army of Nazi party) (SS- private army of Hitler).
- Cleaning of Jews from government services – created vacancies.
- 1934- Hitler introduced rearmament which gave a boost to the economy.
- 1935- Youth got employed in the army.
- MSP for farmers.
- Tax breaks and incentives.
- Increase in wages for workers.
- Social security schemes.
- Leisure activities for workers. 
**Conclusion**

- His economic policies led to a massive fiscal deficit and to fund that he had to do territorial acquisitions
- Therefore his economic policies made war inevitable as otherwise, the economy would have collapsed. 
**SHADES OF SOCIALISM**

- It aims to establish an egalitarian society where there is no exploitation of the have nots by the haves i.e., no oppression by the rich/ strong of the week/ poor.
- In economy the aim is to have equitable distribution of wealth and resources and production take place not solely for-profit motive but social good.
- Therefore, socialism is a goal and there exists different paths to reach this goal as charted out by theorists and statesmen.
- Shades of socialism are basically various roads of socialism.
- In 1956 Nikita Khrushchev had stated that there exist multiple roads to socialism.
- Different shades are Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism, market socialism, democratic socialism, etc. 
**Marxism**

- ==Anti- capitalism== **–** Marx wanted an end to capitalism and believed in the inevitability of socialism.
- Feudalism could not survive because it gave power to limited/ minority elites while masses were exploited.
- Similarly industrial capitalism exploits the masses i.e., the working class and therefore is unsustainable.
- In capitalism, the owner is the owner of the means of production and therefore is the decision maker on issues on production i.e., what to produce, how to produce, how much to produce, where to sell etc.
- Capitalists decide distribution of surplus i.e., profits.
- Whereas the real producer of value in society is the worker and in return they get wages and do not enjoy any decision-making power over the production process and distribution of surplus.
- Therefore, capitalism exploits workers who are masses in a fully industrialized society.
- It is undemocratic as in economy workers do not have any decision-making power.
- Interest of capitalists is inversely proportional to workers.
- In the beginning, there is harmony in society and it is natural for man to engage in joint production.
- With profit motive and private property there emerges conflict in society.
- Therefore, a classless society gets converted into a class-based society and leads to conflicts.
- There is class conflict i.e., the interests of members of capitalist’s class are opposed to the interests of the working class.
- When society is full industrialized, workers will rise and end capitalism.
- Marx was not against development; he was against industrial capitalism.
- He wanted an abundance of goods in society but production should be for social good and not just for-profit motive.
- Marx wanted an end to exploitation of poor peasants; however, small farmers engage in family labour only and therefore whereas workers come together in huge numbers for joint production, there is a sense of community much more in work.
- Peasants are petty-bourgeois; therefore, their revolution will be for increasing their private property and not ending private property.  
- Therefore, they can be members of the revolution but not its leaders.
- Goal was community ownership.
- Revolution would have to be a violent revolution because the capitalists had done political capture of the state. The right to vote is linked only to the rich plus funding of political parties by capitalists.
- Religion demands nonviolence and preaches that suffering is justified or will of the god. Therefore religion, art and culture are also agents of capitalists.
- Only a violent revolution can overcome capitalism.
- Marx wanted unity of workers therefore was against disunity created on the basis of nationality, language, and ethnicity as this would weaken the working class.
- He talked about internationalism against nationalism.
- He believed that there should be the dictatorship of the proletariat (workers).
- He wanted a stateless society and all division should be taken by society at a grassroots level.

**TOPIC FOR NEXT CLASS - CONTINUATION OF SHADES OF SOCIALISM.**
 
# World History Class 16
 
**Core of Socialism**

- **It depends on 2 aspects:**
- Decision-making power, and
- Distribution of wealth.
- **Options in 'decision-making power':**
- Community or people
- Capitalists
- State
- **Options in 'Distribution of wealth':**
- End of private property and all property with community
- End of private property and all property with State
- No end of private property and a mixed economy
- Shared holding in private companies if offered to workers.

**Various Shades of Socialism**

- **Democractic Socialism vs Fabianism**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Democratic Socialism**|**Fabinism/Social Demoracy**|
|The core of ideology is Socialism from below. They desire total decentralization of power in the hands of the community.|They do not desire the end of capitalism. Their only desire is to end the negatives of capitalism.|
|Against the strong state and one-party rule|They desire a strong welfare state which would mitigate the negatives of the purely capitalist economy. They favor a multi-party rule with a universal adult franchise.|
|They reject Models of socialism allowed in the USSR and China.|They favor a mixed economy.|
|Favor factories under workers' control, farms under farmer cooperatives, and Grassroot organizations should be strongest in the Polity.|Against the overthrow of capitalism|
|Desired a weak state: They are against centralized planning as well as the welfare state|Favored the welfare state  <br>The state will use its legislative, executive, and financial powers to reduce the concentration of wealth.|
|They are not concerned about the methods of revolution or who brings it or the kind of polity as long as decentralization is there.|They are against the violent revolution and in favor of the gradual revolution|
 - **Agrarian Socialism**
- It can be divided into 2 types: 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Agrarian Communists**|**Agrarian Socialists**|
|More Radical|Less radical|
|End of all private property|End of all private property but redistribute it to small peasants|
|eg. Stalin in Russia  <br>Mao Zeodang|eg. Post-Independence India  <br>The social revolutionary party of Russia|
 - Other features:
- Organizing the peasants for joint production in the agriculture sector
- Land pooling
- Forming cooperative societies for financing, for procurement of seeds, etc.
- **Indian Socialism:**
- It is a mix of
- Social Democracy.
- Democratic socialism, and 
- Gandhian.
- It favors a mixed economy by having large PSUs.
- Welfare State is there.
- Multi-Party democracy.
- The constitution mandates the State to take measures to increase the participation of workers in the management of industries.
- Establishment of Cooperatives in Agriculture.
- Ended Zamindari without ending private property.
- We have tried to devolve decision-making power through SHGs.
- We have tried to devolve political power through Panchyati Raj Institutions, ULBs, etc.
- Non-Violence
- Arbitration for dispute settlement
- India did not aim for the end of the capitalistic class.
- It also did not adopt any religion.
- India focussed on the protection of different classes, both genders, children, and minorities.
- Post-1991 India moved closure to capitalism without giving up the idea of a welfare state.

**Socialism in Russia:**

- **Political parties:**
- **Social Revolutionary Party:**
- Support base: Peasants
- Aim: Land redistribution in favour of poor peasants but no end of private property
- It did not want rapid industrialization and favoured only gradual industrialization.
- It was so because its focus was on increasing the prosperity of the peasantry.
- **Cadets/Kadets:**
- Support base: Middle class
- They wanted a multi-party democracy with the security of property.
- They wanted capitalism in the economy.
- **Mensheviks:**
- It a Russian word for the minority (In the elections of editorship).
- Hardcore Marxists.
- They waited for the correct time for the revolution to take place.
- As per them, the revolution should take place only after society is fully industrialized.
- They believed only workers can bring communist revolution.
- Therefore no revolution until complete industrialization. - **Bolsheviks:**
- It a Russian word for the majority (In the elections of editorship).
- More revolutionary.
- Led by Lenin
- They wanted immediate revolution.
- Therefore they were ready to have anyone as a member given he is committed to revolution.
- Hence it can be said that they were ready to trust peasants for conducting communist revolution.
- Their attitude was to focus on industrialization after the revolution to stabilize the revolution.
- Because more workers would lend stability to revolution. - **Reasons for the Russian revolution:**
- **Peasants:**
- Redemption fines/payments.
- Serfdom was abolished in 1861 by Russia so as to free labour needed industrialization.
- A serf is a person who is tied to the land. - **Workers:**
- Poor wages and no social security.
- Life of poverty in cities. - **Middle class:**
- Lack of any democracy.
- There was no Parliament and Czar ruled with the support of nobles with autocratic powers.
- High use of Secret police by Czar to curb all political opposition. - **Trigger:**
- Russo-Japanese war 1904-05 leading to a poor economy and loss of prestige.
- **Action:**
- A spontaneous outburst of the public.
- **Result:**
- Czar survived
- The army stayed loyal and protests were crushed.
- Political parties were not united.
- Revolution was spontaneous and planned. - **Timely action by Czar in the form of the October Manifesto.**
- It was a set of promises to address grievances:
- End of redemption payments.
- Increase landholding of small peasants.
- Increase in wages and working conditions.
- Bring democratic reforms. - **February 1917 Revolution:**
- **Reasons:**
- Failure of the October Manifesto.
- Partial fulfilment of the October Manifesto.
- Czar did not implement land distribution.
- Because the big landlords i.e. nobility were his supporters.
- Czar signed the British-Russia agreement of 1907.
- It provided for a trade agreement with Britain.
- It improved the economy in the short term and capitalists were able to pay wages.
- Inspectors were stationed in factories to prevent abuse.
- However, it was not a sustainable improvement as 3 years prior to WW1 workers strike regularly.
- Democracy:
- Czar did establish Parliament (Duma).
- The right to vote was not given to workers.
- However, it was given to the Middle class.
- The first DUMA was disbanded within a year.
- The citizens demanded the responsibility of the Czar's ministers to DUMA.
- The second DUMA suffered the same fate.
- Then Czar changed the right to vote criteria and only elites were allowed to vote.
- 3rd DUMA and 4th DUMA completed their terms but there was no democracy.
- The use of secret police by Czar continued.
- Trigger: First World War was the trigger as Russia lost battles.
- The morale of soldiers was severely down and they blamed Czar's poor leadership for defeat.
- The economy suffered and there was food shortage and inflation.
- The result was Bolsheviks led by Lenin captured the power.
- The rule of the Czar was ended and a provisional government came to power. - **October revolution:**
- **Reasons**:
- Failure of the Provisional government to withdraw from world war, land reforms, hold elections, etc.
- Public desired elections for constituting a constituent assembly which would draft a constitution for a democratic republic.
- However, the Provisional Government did not conduct elections citing World war 1.
- Land distribution was not done.
- The provisional government did not withdraw from World war 1.
- **Action**: 
- Lenin promises people that he would withdraw Russia from World war 1, do land redistribution, and hold elections.
- Thereafter Lenin and supporters, which included a section of the Army, overthrew the provisional government.
- This is called the October Revolution of 1917.
- Lenin signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany to exit the WW-I
- Lands confiscated by small peasants were recognized as legal.
- Elections were held.
- SRP got maximum seats in the Constituent Assembly.
- Bolsheviks turned out to be a minority.

**The topic for the next class: Russian civil war**
 
# World History Class 17
 
**Russian Civil war(1918-20)**

- Between Bolsheviks led by Lenin (Trotsky headed Red Army) vs.
- Whites (i.e Non-Bolsheviks parties) supported by armies of Britain, France, US, and Japan).
- **Why?**
- Bolsheviks fulfilled promises made:
- Land Redistribution (Poor peasants took over the land of big landlords with the support of Bolsheviks during and after the October revolution)
- Withdrew from World war 1.
- Held elections for Constituent Assembly
- However, SRP (Social Revolutionary Party) won maximum seats while Bolsheviks were in minority.
- In Constituent Assembly debates Bolsheviks got marginalized.
- As a result, Lenin disbanded Constituent Assembly.
- This triggered the Russian Civil War from 1918-1920.
- **Result:**
- Bolsheviks won
- Reasons for their victory:
- Red Army was well organized and has able leadership of Trotsky.
- Whites engaged in atrocities which decreased their support base.
- Bolsheviks had the State machinery at their disposal because they had captured power.
- The public came to view Bolsheviks as Nationalists fighting foreign armies.
- The policy of war communism because policies adopted to fight a war to save communism.
- All agrarian produce was to be submitted to the state and peasants were allowed to retain only to feed their families.
- So workers in factories stayed well fed.
- All factories were nationalized.
- So the State has the resources to fight the Russian Civil war.
- All trade was also nationalized.
- Hence the Communism survived in Russia and Russia became USSR.
- Soviet means the base unit at the grassroots level having membership of workers and peasants.
- 15 States were there in the Soviet Socialist Republic.

**Criticism of Lenin**

- **Democracy:** 
- Marx wanted the truest form of Democracy.
- It means that he wanted dictatorship or the absolute will of the masses.
- But Lenin overpowered against the will of the masses.
- **Stateless society:** 
- Marx wanted a Stateless society.
- Lenin made the state stronger through the nationalization of industry/economy.
- He used and strengthen secret police after the Russian Civil war to suppress anti-communists and his own political opponents within the party.
- **The negative impact of war communism:**
- Food shortages in USSR because peasants had no incentive to produce.
- War communism laid the foundation of the nationalized economy which later proved to be the biggest reason for inefficiencies in the economy.
- **Foundation of the one-party system:**
- He laid the foundation of the one-party system which later became a norm in other communist countries.

**New Economic Policy (1921)**

- **Problems faced by Lenin:**
- Food shortages.
- Strife in the society between peasants and workers.
- The economic crisis was going on because of costly World war 1 and the harsh treaty of Brest-Litovsk.
- **New Economic proves that Lenin was practical and pragmatic:**
- Allowed private sector to operate in MSMEs.
- Privatized the trade of goods produced.
- Heavy industry and related trade continued to be under State ownership (India-like).
- Private property/ownership was allowed to continue.
- Community or State ownership was not brought into the agriculture sector to pacify the peasants.
- Peasants could sell their produce in the open markets and needed to pay only a tax.
- He decided the primary focus of budgets will be on the agriculture sector while industrialization to be gradual and not rapid.
- Lenin also signed a trade and investment agreement with Britain.
- This was to improve the faltering Russian economy.
- Therefore Lenin was pragmatic.
- Ideologically he was Marxist however Marx had not given practical details or practical solutions on how to run a Stateless society.
- Therefore Lenin utilized the power of the State to secure the Communist revolution of 1917.
- Further, he was ready for to ideals of Marx like Stateless society and community and power to the community and end of private property.
- However, in short term, he was ready to deviate from Marxist ideals to preserve harmony in the country.
- He was ready to deploy profit motive and capitalistic investment to bring economic stability.
- Lenin was a champion of workers, however for efficiency in factories, in the new economic policy, he gave control of factories to Managers.
- These Managers were from the middle class and put curbs on trade unions.

**Stalinism (1928 to 1953)**

- Lenin died in 1925.
- After a power struggle within the Communist party, Stalin came to power in 1928.
- **Problems in front of power:**
- NEP improved food production. However, the challenge of food shortage still existed.
- Russia was still not industrialized while rest of the Europe had begun industrialization.
- **Personal traits of Stalin:**
- He was radically anti-capitalist. He considered an enemy of Kulaks as an enemy of communism.
- He firmly believed that there would be another attack from Capitalism West on USSR.
- Earlier when Russia turned communist, capitalist nations had sent armies to destroy the communist revolution.
- Firmly believed that only workers can stabilize the communist revolution i.e Little faith peasants.
- He was dictatorial and believed in his supremacy.
- **Economic Policy:**

- He promoted nationalization.
- Rapid industrialization so as to reach full industrialization of USSR as soon as possible.
- It would stabilize the Communist revolution because then the masses will be workers.
- He ended private ownership.
- Collectivization in agriculture ended private property.
- Landowners became agrarian laborers to develop a sense of communism among the peasants and achieve food security.
- Land pooling was implemented for economies of scale.
- The state procured from the peasants.
- As a result, there was no open market sale by the peasants.
- Though some private plots were left, most lands were collectivized.
- This was forced collectivization and Stalin brutally suppressed all opposition by peasants.
- A centralized economy was there.
- Stalin introduced command economy by bringing 5-year plans and State ownership.
- Because of Great Depression 1929, foreign direct investment and earnings from export were not available.
- Stalin needed resources for investment in the industrial sector.
- Therefore resources were to be garnered from within USSR.
- It was the agriculture sector that was the dominant sector.
- Therefore State ownership was introduced via collectivization.
- The State became the owner of agrarian wealth.
- The state would procure agricultural produce from collectives and then sell it back to get resources investment.
- It provided resources for reinvestment into industries.
- Therefore 5-year plans were introduced.
- This built a centralized economy where factories did not have any control. 
- All decisions were made by States.
- Established a totalitarian State.
- Established Gulags-forced labor camps.
- Free and compulsory education where indoctrination in favor of Stalin and communism was taught.
- Total control of media.
- **Positives of Stalinism:**

- Food security was achieved.
- USSR became an industrialized economy and post ww2 it emerged as 2nd superpower after the USA.
- USSR did have Social security for its people.
- Unemployment was reduced significantly.

**NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV(1953-64)**

- **Destalinization:**
- He introduced desalinization.
- That means that he reversed many aspects of Stalin's rule.
- He stated that peaceful co-existence with the West is not just possible but even imperative if a nuclear catastrophe is to be prevented.
- Therefore he tried to reduce tensions with the West.
- This was destalinization because under Stalin the USA-USSR rivalry had increased and the cold war was at its peak.
- Gulags were dismantled
- More freedom to media.
- But anti-party and anti-Stalin articles were not allowed.
- Collectives continued.
- Agriculture: State will pay more for procurement.
- Now farmer could sell produce from his small private land to market;
- Started Virgin land scheme
- But failed due to the geographical conditions.
- He brought some decentralization in the economy by establishing some 100 Regional Economic councils. 
### SOCIALISM IN CHINA
 
### COLD WAR

- An era where 2 superpowers competed with each other for the superior economy, influence, superior military.
- They competed in the arms race, space race, and nuclear race.
- It was the cold war because both were nuclear powers and the direct war would bring nuclear catastrophe.
- Two different powers on two different ideologies on how to organize polity and economy in the society.
- Both competed for hegemony in world affairs and to prove and their system is superior.
- Both were afraid of each other.
    
    - Russian civil war, World War II.
    - 1945 – atomic bomb to threaten USSR.
    - Post great depression fear of communism, also Karl Marx believed in global unity of workers.
- It became a global phenomenon, competition for having or preventing communism or capitalism
- Globally, society was divided into classes, the capitalist class, and the working class.
- The working class in many cases was led by communists who desired the communist revolution.
- The capitalists' sections of society wanted protection from communism.
- Therefore, the US and USSR got the opportunity to meddle in the internal affairs of third-world countries.
- Therefore, the cold war became a global phenomenon.
- NAM was a joint effort led by India, Ghana, Egypt, Iran, Argentina to prevent participation in the cold war, therefore, they declared themselves as neither aligned with the US or to USSR.
- The intensity of the cold war depended on leaders in power.
    
    - Ex – Roosevelt, Nikita Khrushchev.
- Psychological fear of communism, ==fear of loss of liberty, political liberty, loss of property.==
- Therefore, the public in a democratic world supported their governments in anti-USSR activities. - **Yalta conference** – Germany was about to be defeated;
    
    - ![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607044656-3.png)
    - The decision to form UN
    - Stalin promised Roosevelt that he would allow free and fair elections in eastern Europe which were occupied by USSR forces.
    - US and USSR force Japan to surrender by attacking Japanese territory.
      
    
- **Potsdam conference** –
    
    - Germany already defeated;
    - Japan was about to be defeated;
    - German economy destroyed by war reparations;
    - Germany, Austria, and their capitals to be divided into occupation zones where armies of Britain France us will continue to stay.
 
- **The policy of containment came from Truman Doctrine.**
    
    - It means the USA now gave up the policy of isolation permanently.
    - The policy of containment implies containing the spread of communism and for this taking actions in the domain of economy, politics, and military.
    - Economically : Giving monetary assistance to democratic regimes which are allies or potential allies of the USA.
    - Utility:
        
        - People won't support communism if a capitalistic regime delivers growth and stability.
        - Strong capitalistic nations will be better allies for countering USSR.
        - Marshal aid was given to make West Europe prosperous.
        - Stalin termed this attempt of the USA as Dollar imperialism.
    - Militarily:
        
        - 1949: USA formed NATO.
        - As per its manifesto, members can not allow any non-NATO member to set up a military base in their countries.
        - E.g. Until 2014, Crimea was part of Ukraine and Russia has a military base in Crimea.
        - This prevented Ukraine from joining NATO.
        - NATO members have a joint military command.
        - NATO operates on the principle of collective security.
        - Therefore under the Policy of Containment, the USA intended to militarily contain communism.
        - USA tried to ensure that Communists who would-be allies of the USSR do not come to power.
        - E.g. the USA supported China and Polpot's government in Cambodia in the 1970s.
            
            - Both were communists but anti-USSR.
            - This is the irony of the Cold war.
            - An answer lies in the national interests of the USA.
        - The USA via the CIA tried to overthrow communists and socialists if they were able to come to power.
        - For this USA funded non-communists and was engaged in political sabotage.
        - In Iran, there was the rule of Shah as the Constitution of 1906 provided for the semi-absolute rule of Shah.
            
            - There was a Parliament but it was weak.
            - In 1951 a strong popularly elected leader Musjadeq became Prime Minister.
            - He wanted Iran to move towards proper democracy and desired the nationalization of Anglo-Iranian oil companies.
            - It was so because the British company in this Joint Venture had the unfair advantage of more profit share.
            - Talk of nationalization made Britain and the USA anxious.
            - Iran was at the border of the Capitalists and Communist world as the only Middle East country that shared a border with the USSR.
            - Therefore in 1953 USA via the CIA plotted a Coup against Musjadeq and then ensured the absolute rule of Shah.
            - Shah acted like a US puppet and made Iran enter into a military alliance: the ==Baghdad Pact of 1955.==

- **Response of USSR: Iron Curtain in Europe**
    
    - From 1945 to 1947: Communism in Eastern Europe.
        
        - Stalin forbade Eastern European Countries from accessing Marshal aid, 1947.
    - 1947: USSR introduced Molotov plan to counter Marshal aid.
    - Cominform was formed for political control.
    - It was an organization headed by the USSR and countries of Eastern Europe as its members.
    - Its purpose was to control Eastern Europe.
    - Now the whole of Eastern Europe was to be collectivized and industrialized.
    - Eastern European countries were expected to only trade with Communist countries.
        
        - It means that they lost freedom of Trade
    - Comecon was formed in 1949 for economic coordination.
    - Overall Stalin established Eastern Europe as the USSR's sphere of influence.
    - USSR came to dominate half of Europe.
    - The iron curtain implies a lack of interaction between western Europe and Eastern Europe.
    - There was 
        
        - No trade
        - No people to people contact
        - No foreign policy cooperation.
        - This represents the division of Europe.
    - Yugoslavia under Tito refused to submit to this control of the USSR.
        
        - He was a nationalist communist.
        - Yugoslavia was removed from Cominform.
        - **Yugoslavia** 
            
            - Followed its own road to socialism.
            - Gave control of factories to workers.
            - Introduced bonuses and other Capitalist measures to boost productivity in factories.
            - Instead of forced collectives, allowed peasants to form voluntary cooperatives.
            - Therefore, it followed democratic socialism.
            - One-party system
                
                - Traded with capitalist west.
                - Joined NAM as a founding member.
            - Result: Socialism in Yugoslavia failed as ethnic nationalism led to conflict within Slavs.
                
                - Factories under workers (In a way profit motive never ended)
    - **Iron Curtain**
        
        - Czechoslovakia coup 1948:
        - It was the only Eastern European country that had a multi-party system in 1948.
        - Elections were due and it was certain that the communist party would perform poorly.
        - The public was angry.
        - Communist govt. refused Marshal aid because of USSR pressure.
        - USSR forces surrounded Czechoslovakia.
        - Communists did coup de tat.
        - Elections were held and only the communist party could field candidates.
        - Therefore, it turned into a communist nation and the iron curtain was now complete.

- **Arms Race**
    
    - By 1949, both the USA and USSR had atomic bombs and by 1953 both had Hydrogen bombs.
    - Both powers tried to have military superiority by developing more sophisticated weapons and engaging in piling up nuclear weapons.
    - Both powers even aspired to launch missiles from Space.
    - Therefore, the world became more dangerous.
    - However, the Arms race drained the USSR of resources. - **Thaw in cold war:**
    
    - ==1953==: Nikita Krushev came into power.
    - Truman left the office.
    - There was a partial thaw in the cold war
    - Events in thaw:
        
        - Korean war came to an end.
        - This allowed the easing of tensions between the USA and the USSR.
    - There was the 1st Indo-China war (1946-54).
    - 1956: Cominform was ended.
    - Because Nikita gave freedom to eastern European countries.
    - It improved relationships with Tito
        
        - Apart from this, there was an Austrian State treaty 1955.
    - With this treaty, the Austrian zones were merged.
    - Nikita feared a union between East and West Germany.
    - Therefore, on the condition of Austria not joining NATO, USSR agreed to allow a united, independent Austria.
    - Both the USA and USSR lifted veto on entry of their allies on UN.
    - It led to an increase in UN Membership and it became more representative.
    - But the tensions did not completely evaporate.
- **Partial in the thaw:**
    
    - **Warsaw pact, 1955:** It was a NATO-like organization that was formed by USSR.
    - It was formed when the USA added West Germany to NATO and NATO reached the border of the Communist world.
- **Arms race continued.**
- **Poland 1956:** Public held huge anti-USSR demonstrations because of poor standards of living, low wages, high taxes, etc.
    
    - USSR tanks entered Poland and surrounded the capital.
    - Result: Compromise
    - Nikita allowed Poland freedom in domestic policies and Poland was to stay aligned with USSR in foreign policy.
- **Hungarian uprising, 1956:**
    
    - Trigger: 1956 speech of Nikita where he talked about multiple roads to Socialism.
    - People thought that they can now have independent policies.
    - Nagy: The leader began talking about withdrawing from the Warsaw pact and having non-communist in governments.
    - Result: Nikita sent the army.
        
        - Nagy was executed and protests were crushed.
    - Therefore, Nikita wanted a reduction in tensions but not a weakening of communism and the USSR's power in Europe.

- **Korean war**
    
    - **Background**
        
        - Korea got created in 1948.
        - War broke out between North Korea (NK) and South Korea (SK) between 1950-1953
        - **Reason for Korean War (Attack by NK on SK):**
            
            - Rising nationalism amongst people of Korea (North and South).
            - Rising Communism.
            - Military Strength of North Korea (as they had military equipment left by the Allied troops during WW2).
            - North Korea thought of China as an ally.
        - **Impact of Korean War (1950-53)**
            
            - Arms race b/w SK and NK
            - 1st military action by US under Policy of Containment
            - UN got perceived as a tool of capitalist bloc
            - China's image improved (**Reason**: Able to push back US army back in Korean Peninsula & so did the strength of its claim to UNSC seat (1971))
- Military alliances began to appear in ==Asia & Pacific e.g.: SEATO, Baghdad Pact 1955, etc.==
    
    - Dangerous doctrines came into circulation
    - **Examples:**
        
        - ==Massive Retaliation==
        - Doctrine of Brinkmanship (to provoke to the verge of wars)
        - ==MAD==: Mutually assured destruction  e.g. Nuclear stockpiles
        - ==Nuclear deterrence==
- **Cuban Crisis**
    
    - **Background :**
        
        - ==CUBA== became protectorate of USA in 1898. USA interventions increased henceforth.
        - **Reason for Cuban Crisis:**
            
            - Lack of proper Democracy.
            - Corruption prevalent in the state.
            - Resentment against US interventions.
    - **Reason for this resentment:**
        
        - Deployment of US troops;
        - Puppet Government handled by USA e.g. Batista;
        - Economic inequality;
        - Domination of USA in Cuban Economy;
    - **Events:**
        
        - At last, Castro finally formed a liberal (not communist) govt (1959).
        - He wanted the welfare of the people and sought the help of USA after coming to power but USA denied him help.
        - Castro initiated many programmes e.g. : Land distribution, Nationalisation of economic sector etc. which is disliked by the USA  (hence imposed economic sanctions on CUBA)
        - **Bay of Pigs 1961:** US-supported attack by Cuban exiles to overthrow Castro. Castro won the battle.
        - **Result of Bay of Pigs**
            
            - After the Bay of Pigs, Cuba became a communist state & strengthened One Party System.
    - **Cuban Missile Crisis 1961**
        
        - **Background**: US implemented a blockade on USSR ships travelling to Cuba. The world reached the brink of war.
        - **Reason for Cuban Missile Crisis**: 
            
            - USSR stationed nuclear warheads in Cuba.
            - (Reason: Arms Race between USSR and USA during the cold war)
        - **Impact of Cuban Crisis:**

            - US removed missiles from Turkey, USSR from Cuba
            - Signed pact that US won't attack Cuba.
            - ==Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1963==): No test in an open environment - **Berlin Wall (1961-89)**
    
    - West Germany was more prosperous than East Germany and this led to people exodus into West Berlin.
    - To prevent this, Nikita built this wall.
    - Nikita tried to destalinise the USSR and shown friendly gesture and promoted cooperation
    - But felt deceived by USA overtures eg Spy plane of USA etc. - **Vietnam War**
    
    - **Background**
        
        - 1st Indochina War (1946-54): People of Indochina wanted independence from France.
        - Guerrilla warfare tactics were used in this war against French soldiers.
    - **Result of Ist Indochina War**
        
        - **Geneva Agreement 1954**
            
            - Laos, Vietnam & Columbia were given independence & Vietnam was temporarily divided along 17th parallel.
            - Popular communist leader Ho Chi Minh (supported by China and USSR) formed temporary govt in NV (North Vietnam)
        - **Civil War after Geneva Agreement 1954**
            
            - Elections were scheduled for 1956 for a govt of united Vietnam but the SV govt, fearing Ho Chi Minh popularity, backed out under US influence.
            - Thus Vietnam got partitioned due to Cold War
            - People wanted Unity of NV and SV
      
    - **Reason for Vietnam War (1961-75)**
        
        - People wanted unity.
        - Cold war between USA and USSR.
        - Unpopular govt in SV.
        - Peasants demanded land reforms.
        - National Liberation Front (coalition of parties) failed to convince Diem (Ruler of SV(USA’s puppet) for holding negotiations with NV for a united Vietnam.
        - Thus, Vietkong (communists of SV) started Guerrilla warfare.
    
    - **Events**
        
        - **Under Kennedy (1961-3)** (Supported SV):
            
            - Safe Village Policy (Relocating non-communist civilians to a village)
        - **Under Johnson (1963-9):**
            
            - Bombed NV & sent a million troops
        - **Under Nixon (1969-74)**
            
            - No more troops but Vietniamization i.e. better training & arms to SV army.
    - **Result of Vietnam War:**
        
        -  US intervention failed & Vietnam got united
        - **Why US lost the Vietnam War  (1961-1975)**
            
            - Safe village policy of Kennedy failed.
                
                - **(Reason for failure of this policy:** People supported Communist Guerrillas who merged with the villagers. Thus failing US policy of Isolating the Guerillas)
            - **NV resilience:**
                
                - (They shifted their factories and people from the cities to escape USA bombing under Johnson's Regime
                - Continued to support Guerrilla (vietkong) of SV with supplies of Arms, Ammunitions and Food)
                -  Support of Arms and aid by China and USSR
                - Nixon Regime failed to destroy the supply route from NV to SV i.e Ho Chi MhiH trail.
                - The trail passed through forest and the people of NV carried supplies for years on foot and it was their resilience that the supply route remains active.
                - Public opinion shifted against the government in US. Thousands of US soldiers died in war.
    - **Reason for the shift in this perception**
        
        - Human rights violations disgusted the US public eg. Use of poison gas, NAPALM Jelly that burnt people alive.
        - Also, incident of hundreds of Vietnamese was shot point blank
    - **China Vietnam Tension in 1970s**
        
        - **Background**
            
            - **South China Sea Dispute:** 
                
                - Paracel Islands were disputed islands and China in 1974, captured them.
                - These islands are also claimed by Vietnam.
                - Hereafter, Vietnam supported USSR in foreign policy against China.
            -  China and USSR had old boundary disputes (1858: Territory above river Amur taken over by USSR)
            - Since 1958, China and USSR have become drifting apart when Mao criticised Nikita for talking about peaceful coexitence with capitalist West. 
            - China now wanted to compete against  USSR for leadership to Communist World.
            - So, this led to China moving close to US in 1970s to counter USSR. 
            - Later China was opposed to USSR invading Afghanistan in 1979 as it meant increasing the influence of USSR in the mutual neighbourhood of China and USSR.
            - In 1971, in a surprise move via **TABLE Tennis Diplomacy** (Where US and China sports teams played against each other).
            - **Result of Table Tennis Diplomacy**
                
                - US agreed to give UNSC seat to communist China. 
                - In 1978, US withdrew recognition to Govt in Taiwan as Govt of whole of China
                - Dec 1978, **Vietnam attacked communist Cambodia (**under POLPOT's Khymer Rogue Regime)
                - **Reason for the attack on Cambodia:**
                    
                    - Polpot was a puppet of China and USA.
                    - He provoked Vietnam with strikes on Vietnamese islands and engaging in the Genocide of Vietnamese. This led China to attack communist Vietnam in 1979.
                    - But China failed to capture its capital Hanoi and returned back claiming that it wanted to only teach a lesson to Vietnam.

- **Afghanistan war 1979-1989**
    
    - USSR wanted to keep Pro USSR government in Afghanistan.
    - Taliban Mujahedeen's wanted to overthrow government.
    - USA supported  Mujahedeen's by supplying them with arms and ammunitions esp the rocket launcher which could have shot down the USSR helicopters.
    - The aid was provided through Pakistan which had nexus with Pashtuns of Afghanistan.
    - Pakistan wanted dominance in Afghanistan as it feared Indian influence over there.
    - Finally, USSR lost the war. - **Other events related to Cold war**
    
    - In 1981, **Solidarity Trade Union in Poland** protested.
    - Their Demand: to allow them to establish their own party and allow multiparty elections.
    - USSR sent troops to put down the protests.
    - ARMS Race continued to drain the USSR economy
    - In late 1980s communism began failing in Europe
    - Poland overthrew communism in 1989.
    - Berlin wall was demolished in 1989
    - And soon within two years, communist ended in the whole of Eastern Europe and USSR itself disintegrated.

- **Why USSR failed in Cold WAR.**
    
    - **External Factor**
        
        - Communism in many cases was not a product of a people's movement.
        - It was imposed on the people eg: eastern Europe.
        - Therefore, Ultimately people overthrew it.
        - Communism failed to fulfil the utopia of empowerment of the masses.
        - It was the party and its communist state which captured power and the people did not benefit from any devolution of power as desired by Karl Marx.
        - Therefore the oppression by capitalists got replaced by oppression of the state.
        - Communism in USSR survived the Russian Civil war, the German attack in 1941 and the whole cold war (1947- 1991).
        - But, It failed from within as people rose against the communist state.
        - US focussed on strengthening Western Europe and other capitalist countries while USSR exploited East Germany and curtailed freedom of trade of Eastern European countries.
        - US has far more deep pockets than USSR and therefore USSR could not match the aid given by US to its allies.
        - Centralised Economic System of communist economies hurt economic efficiencies.
      
    - **The command economy meant:**
        
        - That factories did not have any autonomy over decisions of production and profit utilisation.
        - Lack of market price, which tells the level of abundance or shortage of any product.
        - Capitalist Economy working on principle of profit maximisation as this utilizes the resources more efficiently.
        - Therefore, Communism failed as the communist economy failed.
        - Workers in Communist countries had lesser wages than those in capitalist countries.
        - Light industries shortages continued to affect USSR.
        - Therefore standard of living of people did not approve as it did in the West.
        - USSR economy was drained by expenditure done in cold war.  i.e. giving aid to allies, Arms race, space race, nuclear race, Military interventions etc.
        - If same had been spent on its people then communism would have survived. 
      
    - **Factors internal to USSR** 
        
        - **Brezhnev Era (1964-1984)** is also called as era of stagnation. As no reforms were carried out to improve the economy. 
        - Government corruption was on rampant. Brezhnev himself stated that how can a government servant run houshold on government salary.
        - Expenditure on cold war increased eg. Military intervention in Afghansitan 1979 and Poland 1981.
        - Reforms attempted by Mikhail Gorbechev failed and leadership of Gorbechev led to disintegration of USSR. - **Why Communism survived in China but failed in USSR**
    
    - China's communism was flexible and responded to contextual needs of the time
    - **Examples**:
        
        - 1949-1957: Russia like policies; 
        - 1958-1976: Great Leap Forward; 
        - 1976+: Market Socialism:
        - While there are mild or little reforms in USSR.
        - No burden on China of leading the communist world during cold war; Therefore it did not bleed Chinese economy
        - Deng Xiaoping was ready to use force to save one-party system and did not compromise on it while Gorbechev did.
      
    - **Eg**: **Democracy Wall 1978**:
        
        - Wall carrying posters by supporters of Deng came up in different cities around 1976.
        - All were removed  except for wall in Beijing since it was consituency of Deng
        - By 1978, posture became more daring and demanded multi party democracy.
        - Deng cracked down harsh and made clear that he wont compromise on one party System.
    - **Eg: TIANAMEN SQUARE (1980)**
        
        - Here youth of china began protest against sacking of a liberal reformer from CCP because of pressure from left-wing radicals of CCP.
        - Soon, protests took form of Pro-democracy protests.
        - Gorbachev was on a state visit and Deng felt that people embarrassed him.
        - He deployed tanks and Military.
        - He made clear to the world that despite supporting capitalism in economy, he won't compromise on one-party system.
        - Deng had better control over his party than Gorbechev.
      
    - **Mikhail** **Gorbachev**
        
        - **Personality/Views:**
            
            - Economic Revival of USSR
            - Gradual Movement towards capitalist economy
            - Balance the right wing and left wing Reformers
            - Both economic and political reforms must go hand in hand etc.
        - **Polic****ies**
            
            - GLASNOST (openess) ;
            - Perestroika (reforms)
    
- Iran (1932), Jordan (1946), Lebanon (1945).
- Why – Strategic location – Suex canal + Persian gulf.
- Oil -Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Kuwait.
- Arab unity – Israel wanted unity like the European economic community.
   

- The colonial powers wanted to continue the economic and political benefits from the colonies even after they became independent.
- They followed a threshold approach whereby they would try to maintain colonialism until a threshold of nationalist struggle is reached beyond which the cost of suppressing the nationalist struggle is high and independence is assured sooner or later.
- Therefore they gave independence once the threshold was reached to maintain good or special relations post-independence to ensure that a colony won't join the soviet camp and the interest of settlers if any are safeguarded. 
- The British for example wanted colonies to remain part of the British commonwealth to maintain a special economic relationship with ex-colonies.
- France also tried to organize the African colonies into a commonwealth-like organization.
 
- The newly independent colonies were developed and their economy was weak because of the long exploitation of colonialism. 
- Therefore, they needed aid and assistance which was provided by the ex-colonial powers and international institutions like IMF and World Bank.
- But, these loans or aid were attached with conditionalities, the newly independent nations were not allowed to spend this money on social infrastructures like free health and education as that would threaten the chances of paying back the loans. 
- The western powers and IMF and the world bank dominated the policies of these nations instead of the loans given.
- They tried to extract concessions in form of opening up the economy to their businesses.
- This phenomenon came to be called neo-colonialism where despite political independence the exploitation by foreign powers and their institutions continued.
- Black majority rule in Africa - the blacks fought for BMR (BLACK MAJORITY RULE) against the settlers.
- Especially where settlers were in high numbers - Ex - Kenya, Rhodesia. 
- 1960 onwards, the international pressure on settlers increased to give democratic rights to blacks. 
- Ex-United nations and commonwealth applied sanctions.
- In the commonwealth, newly independent countries like India and other African countries put pressure on Britain and even threatened to exit the commonwealth if it didn't do enough to force settlers in South Africa to bring BMR.
- As neighboring countries gained independence in the 1960 and 70s they started supporting guerilla warfare of nationalists in Rhodesia in southwest Africa.
- Angola supported post-independence in 1975.
- In South Africa, Rhodesia supported post-1980. 
- Therefore as more African countries got independence, chances of BMR in neighboring countries increased. 
- By the early 1990s, BMR was established in Africa.

### Events that led to WW1:
                   
### IMPACT OF WORLD WAR
   

**Treaty of Versailles (TOV)**
 
- It was a ==dictated peace i==.e. Germans were only allowed to submit their request in writing and were not allowed to speak.
- None of their demands were met therefore was a dictated peace.
- It was very humiliating and harsh : ==No Arms, No Money, No territory, only war guilt==.
- Germany was allowed to have at max 1 lakh soldiers, only 6 warships, no tanks, no submarines, no airplanes **+** **conscription ie. Compulsory military service was barred****.**
- Very huge war reparation **6600 Million pounds were to be paid by Germany** and France and Belgium were major recipients.
    
    - These reparations were to be paid on account of the loss of civilian infrastructure.
- Areas occupied by Germany have liberated e.g. Belgium, France, etc
- **Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland** were not given back to Russia but were made independent.
- Alsace Lorraine was returned to France.
- Saar’s coal was to be France by 15 years and SAAR to be under League of Nation
- Germany lost its colonies (Pacific island, Africa)
- Danzing (a port city in north Germany) was under the league of Nations to allow Poland access to sea trade.
- **Rhineland (lay between France Belgium and the rest of Germany ) was demilitarised** but Germany could not station its army for Rhineland. The purpose was to ensure that if Germany intends to attack Belgium and France then enough warning is available to them.
- Some part of Germany was given for the creation of Poland and to Belgium and Lithuania
- **War guilt Clause:** this made ==Germany legally responsible for WW1 i.==e. Germany legally accepted that they were legally responsible for WW1.
- Reason: To legally bind Germany pay war reparation
 
**TREATY OF SEVRES**
  - **Signed with Ottoman**
    
    - Ottoman was reduced to small turkey
    - Arab areas were taken over by France and Britain
    - Some Turk populated areas were given to Greece
    - There was the rise of Nationalist Mustafa Kemal who defeated Greece and Pushed it out of Turk Populated areas (Eastern Thrace and Smyrna)
    - Straits of Dardanelles was permanently opened
    - Khalifa rule was ended and Turkey was declared a ==secular Republic==.
    - In India, since Khalifa rule was ended Khilafat Movement also ended
      
    
 
**TREATY OF SAINT GERMAINE AND OF TRIANON**

- A small Austria and Hungary were created.
- Principal of Self-determination was followed to create new nations

**NEW NATIONS CREATED**

- (Territorial Reorganization)
- Poland was created from the Austria-Hungary empire, Germany, Russia.
- Czechoslovakia for Czechs and Slovaks from Austria- Hungary.
- Estonia. Latvia, Lithuania, Finland created from the Russian Territory
- A new Austria and a new Hungary,
- Yugoslavia from Serbia, Austria-Hungary, Montenegro.  
**GEOPOLITICS**

- The USA emerged as the top power. Pre-world War I: its economy was strongest and now **WW1 acted as a catalyst for making the USA a top geopolitical power** as well.
- The USA under President Woodrow Wilson played a lead role in negotiations of Peace treaties.
- He was the main force behind the creation of the League of Nations as an international organization responsible for maintaining world peace.
- Europe was devastated by WW1 while the USA entered only in 1917 (less war expenditure)
- The ==USA and Japan benefitted== as they captured the export markets of Europe.
- However, Republicans came to power in the US and they reverted back Policy of Isolation.
- Therefore, the US did not ratify the peace treaties and the USA did not join the League of Nations.
 
- **Reasons:** they did not have faith that **peace treaties** will be able to give peace since they were harsh, rather created new frictions in Europe
- Turks living under Greece
- Italy was not given promised territory
- All Germans not under Germany.
- There was a change in public perception towards war which put pressure on the government to avoid war.
- This was because of the huge devastation caused by WW1.
- Dangerous new weapons were used for 1st time, i.e. Machine Guns, barbed wires,etc.
- Europe came under War debt of the USA as they had taken loans to fight WW1
 
**VERDICT ON PEACE TREATIES**

- WW I sowed the seed of WW II/ Peace treaties were unjust?
- **Background:** **Woodrow Wilson Points**
    
    - **They were war aims of the** USA i.e. why the USA fighting WW1. They are in line with the war aims of Britain and France

**Factors leading to World War II** 
               

**Six Month Phony War (Oct. 1939-March 1940)**

- During this period no land operations were undertaken by the Allies or the Germans.
- In 1942, Hitler defeated France and also broke the Non-aggression pact with USSR.
- Germany attacked the USSR.
- Japan attacked the USA at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.
- This led the USA to declare war against Japan.
- This pre-emptive strike at Pearl Harbor led to the entry of the USA into World War II.
 
**The policy of Appeasement: Summary**
 
**Outcomes of Policy of Appeasement**
 
**Why appeasement?**
 
**Responsibility for World War 2**
 
**Highlights of WW2**  
**Until 1942 Germany was very successful**

- **Defeated France**
    
    - France was ill-prepared because:
        
        - During the **Phony War** of 6 months, France adopted a defensive stance, therefore, gave time to Germany. 
        - This was because of the **Maginot Line** (a long stretch of iron pillars) on the France-German border.
        - Germany's blitzkrieg had huge success. 
        - **Blitzkrieg** - a strategy of shock and awe whereby swift and simultaneous attack by air force and ground motorized divisions is done. 
        - It led to quick victories.
        - France had slow-moving ground troops.
        - Lack of military alliance with the USSR.

**Why Axis powers (Germany, Italy, Japan) lost WW2**

- **Non-performance by Italy:**
    
    - it suffered continuous defeat at the hands of British forces 
        
        - eg. in North Africa. Hitler had to rescue Italy by sending German forces to aid when those were vitally required against the USSR.
    - Initially, Japan seemed unstoppable as it captured the pacific islands of the US plus defeated Britain in SE Asia and Dutch in East Indies. 
    - However, the US focus on aircraft carriers and air power led to reversals for Japan.
    - Japan’s tactical mistake was that it focussed on producing warships instead of aircraft carriers.
    - Therefore the air force played an important role in WW2.
- **Resource imbalance**:
    
    - The US was the number one economy, USSR had the largest army and massive resources,
    - Britain had a huge army recruited from its colonies and huge resources from the colonial empire. 
    - The Axis powers compared poorly against the resources of Allied powers.
- **Two big mistakes by axis powers:**
    
    - First, the attack on the US brought the US into the war.
    - Second, Germany’s attack on the USSR, the consequent loss turned the tide in favour of the Allies.
 
**Indian context**: 

- Britain lost to Japan in Burma, Singapore.
- The prisoners of war were organized in **Indian National Army** by Mohan Singh. 
- Later, Rash Behari Bose and then SC Bose took over the leadership of INA. 
- INA was created with the support of Japan.
- Finally, it lost in Burma fighting the British Indian Army. 
- Netaji set up a **‘**Provisional’ Government of India in exile. 
- Netaji also set up a women's battalion which he named after Rani of Jhansi. 
- There was a famine in Bengal due to the export of food to meet the needs of the British Army.
- Prisoners of War received massive support from the people of India on their return to India. 
- Followed by **INA agitation**, **Naval rating mutiny,** etc. 
- This public upsurge was utilized by INC for impending election, emerging as an undisputed top party 
- While Muslim League overwhelmingly dominated Muslim constituencies. 
- The British officials later admitted that the Gandhian struggle combined with the lack of a trustworthy British Indian army
- Which was the reason behind them leaving India. 
 
**Result of WW2**

- The world became a **nuclear world**. 
- As the US used an atom bomb on Japan to end the war quickly and also to threaten the USSR.
- The era of the **Cold War** started between two new superpowers. 
- Europe got weakened therefore the European powers of western Europe organized themselves into-
- European Economic Community that later became the EU
- **Decolonization** began
    
    - **UN** got established
    - Arab nationalism rose and so did the Arab-Israel conflict.

**Fascism**  
**Feature of fascism**
 
**Fascist Great Nation features**
 
**Why Mussolini came to power**
 
**Measures were taken by Mussolini to consolidate power**:
   

**Evaluation of Mussolini’s rule**:  
**Positives**:

- Industry - he gave incentives, industrial production increased
- Agriculture - **Battle of the Wheat program** - achieved food security through MSP.
- **Land Reclamation program** - promoted cultivation of mountains, drained the swamps, etc.
- **Public Works Programme** - to counter unemployment
    
    - Public Morale was high
- **“After Work” Organization** compensated the workers
    
    - Foreign Policy successes - Corfu, Fiume events
 
**Negatives**:

- Economic issues - fiscal deficit, high inflation, remained energy-deficient
- The economic crisis of 1929 - Mussolini could not manage it.
- Inequity - No effective social security program, regional inequity
- Corruption was very high.
 
**Fall of Mussolini: Reasons**

- Loss in WW2
- People felt Mussolini had made Italy a puppet state of Germany.
- How totalitarian was Mussolini’s rule:
- People revolted means there was not a ‘total control’.

### SOCIALISM IN CHINA
 
**1****st** **Phase** **1949 – 1958** 

- It was a phase of Russia like communism.
- Collectivization of agriculture, peasants were organized into collectives.
- Each collective had 300 – 400 families.
- The focus was on industrialization.
- Within the industry, heavy industry was focused upon, rapid industrialization**.** 
- 5-year plans were introduced with USSR’s help and experts.
 
**2****nd** **phase** **1958 – 1976** 

- The great leap forward.
 
**Background**

- 1st 5-year plan achieved all its targets and Mao was happy with the progress.
- Complaint against indiscipline of workers who were also party cadres.
- Because Nikita Khrushchev had introduced capitalist features in the economy, therefore, some sections demanded similar reforms.
- Leading to a feedback campaign by Mao called hundred flower’s campaigns.
- Mao was surprised by the result of feedback.
- People were still not satisfied.
- Some sections even demanded electoral/ democratic reforms in form of multi-party democracy.
- Therefore, Mao brought his own form of socialism in China which he called GLF 1958 or great leaf forward.
- He was a hard-core Marxist and criticized Nikita Khrushchev for diluting Marxism by introducing capitalist features in the USSR and talk of peaceful co-existence with the west.

**Great Leap Forward**  
**Agriculture**

- Mao now shifted policies in China to suit the context of China.
- China was henceforth to focus on the agriculture sector.
- Since the majority of the population was engaged in agriculture therefore the focus won’t be on the industrial sector.
- The purpose was to convince or to bring benefits of communism to rural masses.
- Collectives were replaced by communes.
- A model of agrarian communism.
- Each commune had 75000 people.
- It was to act as a unit of local self-government.
- Funds were provided to communes to execute local projects as per the local context.
- They could build small roads, primary health care centres, schools and creches, small irrigation projects, etc.
- 30–40 technicians and party officials were attached with each commune to help them run the commune.
- Because of the focus on the agriculture sector, China was able to overcome problems of food shortages.
- However, in short term, agricultural production suffered because of a ==vagary== of nature in 1959 -60 – draught.
- Because of the loss of private property, there was little incentive with sections of the peasantry, this hurt the food production.

**Industry**

- Focus on light industry, not heavy industries.
- The focus was on rapid industrialization.
- Therefore, in the long term, light industry shortages were not there in China.
- It improved the standard of living.
- Therefore, Mao wanted people to experience the positives of communism.
- The industry was to be labour-intensive since China had a large population therefore instead was to curb unemployment.
- The industry was to be de-centralized.
- Mao desired setting up of 6 lakh backyard steel furnaces located all across China and producing tools for the agriculture sector this prevented migration of masses to urban areas.
- Overall, by 1976 China was able to have a prosperous and empowered rural population living in the countryside. There was no mass-migration during Mao’s rule.
- With gradual industrialization, China had a strong oil and steel sector, a strong machine-building industry.
- Due to communes, the CCP headquarters got continuous feedback from grassroots levels.
- Therefore, the government was not detached from the masses.

**Positives**

- Unemployment plus food shortages plus migration were resolved.
- Women were more empowered because of the focus on the agriculture sector, they were skilled and educated.

**Cultural Revolution** **1966 - 1969**

- In short term, GLF didn’t deliver results, and opposition against Mao increased within the party.
- The cultural revolution was a propaganda campaign by Mao where he asked his supporters to come out on the streets and campaign in favour of Mao’s policies.
- Mao wanted to show his strength to his political opponents within CCP.
- Political opponents were purged by Mao. EX- dang Xiaoping was sent to the countryside to work among the peasantry for 4 years, his son committed suicide after torture.
- Students left schools and colleges to campaign for Mao.
- Street plays, rallies and processions were held.
- Crowds however became unruly and a ==gang of 4== lost control of supporters.
- Property and lives of anyone considered to be anti-Mao were attacked.
- Finally, Mao withdrew the movement in 1969.
    
    - Huge amount of violence and destruction.
    - The economy suffered massively.
    
    - Mao was able to keep GLF on Marxist lines i.e., Maoism was to continue.

**Impact**  
**Positives**
 
**Market socialism**

- Deng came to power in 1976 believed that capitalism in an economy can make China great.
- However, in politics, there cannot be a multi-party system as it is prone to political influence by the capitalists.
- Leading to politicians making policies to benefit selfish capitalist interests.
- With the monopoly of the communist party via a one-party system, it can be ensured that wealth created by the capitalist engine of the economy is steered in favour of the masses.
    
    - ==Open door policies== implemented.
    - Decreased trade barriers.
    - In 1980 SEZ was established**.** 
    - In SEZs private companies could operate**.** 
    - FDI is allowed in SEZs.
    - China opens up to capitalistic investment.
    - SEZs are responsible for the rapid economic rise of China.
    - In 1980 China joined IMF. World Bank which was till now they were considered tools of capitalists.
    - Domestically profit motive was used to increase the efficiency of workers.
    - Deng believed it is good to be rich.
    - More money to communes for government procurement.
    - The government was the only buyer.
    - Communes were allowed freedom in the utilization of revenues earned.
    - Lower taxes on communes.

**Policy of Deng**
 
**3****nd** **Phase –** **1984 till today.** 

- Communes were broken up and the land was distributed among the members of the communes.
- Collectivization ended.
- The government will procure only essential items for food security. Rest can be sold in the open market to earn profit.
- End of the monopoly of state of Agri produce.
- Market economy introduced in the agriculture sector.
- Administered prices i.e., the government is fixing prices.
- Privatization on unviable PSUS.
- PSU brought under market competition.
- Local provincial leaders of the Chinese party are given the freedom to take initiatives, design policies, and incentives to boost the economy of their region.
- Decentralization of economic policy.
- Even speculation for profit embraced.
- In the 1990’s freedom of travel abroad was given to people.
 
**Present situation**

- PSUs are self-reliant.
- In private companies, CCP representative has seats in the board this is how Chinese communist party control behavior of private companies**.** 
- Therefore, the state is using Chinese companies to further its foreign policy goals.
- For example, Chinese private investment in Africa.
- Critics argue that there is not market socialism in ==China but state capitalism.==
 
### COLD WAR
      

**COLD WAR EVENTS**

- The US under Truman nuked Japan without taking USSR into confidence, this led to anxiety in USSR regarding threats from the capitalist world.

    - But USSR treated its occupation zone as a colony and extracted war reparations.

        - Therefore Germany got divided into East and West Germany.
        - The USA worked towards the economic prosperity of West Germany.
        - It brought monetary and economic unity between the 3 western zones.
        - It also bought political unity by creating West Germany.
        - Therefore WEST Germany would be prosperous while East Germany suffered from poverty and economic stagnation.
        - The USA realized that because of geographic distance it was ill-prepared for the war.
        - Therefore it created NATO.

- Earlier, decolonization had taken place during the wars after the French revolution of 1789 because of the weakening of colonial powers i.e., Spain and Portugal.
- Similarly, by end of WWII European colonial powers were weak because of the devastation of two consecutive world wars in a short span of time.
- Therefore, maintaining colonial rule became costly. 
- Costly - the rise of nationalism in the colonies.
- Exposure to soldiers from the colonies, they developed a belief that European powers were not invincible.
- Soldiers wanted liberty or their mother country as well they fought for the liberty of allied powers from axis powers. 
- The propaganda of allied powers and the goal of liberty in the Atlantic charter that defined the war aims of allied powers also inspired them.
- There was fear of defection in armies.
- There was the rise of nationalist movements in the colonies in Asia and south-east Asia.
- Because of war-related difficulties like high inflation and taxes and in general because of western education which had been introduced by colonial powers to strengthen the idea of Whiteman's burden i.e., the colonial rule is good colonies because of superior civilization. 
- Western education created an educated and nationalist middle class in colonies. 
- These middle-class leaders led the nationalist struggle.
- These western educated leaders linked colonialism with capitalism. 
- Ex- Lala Lajpat Rai argues that colonies are a source of cheap raw materials and an export market for European businesses.
- Earlier, post-1892, the moderates of INC led by Dada Bhai Naoraoji, MG Ranade, and RC Dutt proved how colonialism led to the drain of wealth from India.
- Inspired by socialism and the support of the USSR, communist and socialist leadership emerged in the colonies. 
- Especially communist-led guerrilla warfare against the colonial power. 
- US and USSR had emerged as superpowers after WWII and there was the decline of western Europe.
- The US wanted the expansion of its business and trade across the world, therefore, wanted de-colonization for access to markets of colonies.
- Except where decolonization meant the expansion of the spread of communism.
- The US favored decolonization ideologically as it was one of the first countries to overthrow colonialism. 
- USSR supported the freedom struggle of colonies as communism advocated the end of all oppression and blamed capitalism for colonialism. 
- As governments of independent colonies would be pro-USSR after gaining independence.
- United Nations also exerted pressure on the colonial powers as the UN charter favor liberty and democracy and the UN was dominated by the US and USSR.
