**Reading Comprehension Class01**  
**Reading Comprehension**

- **What is the objective behind given a particular passage and how do you get confused?**
- A most common issue is that you can understand the passage but not be able to relate with the options provided.
- There are 3 ways to answer:
- **Make assumptions:**
- Such answers are not supported by any evidence from the passage.
- Here you should highlight the possibilities.
- **Draw inferences:**
- Here do not assume anything.
- There should be solid evidence for the answer you are choosing.
- **Arguments:**
- It has 2 connotations
- Positive or 
- Negative
- **Reading can be divided into 3 parts:**
- **Pre-reading:**
- Here we made a call whether we know the passage or not.
- It is very important as it helps in finding how far you can relate to the topic.
- **During reading:**
- It is the most important part as a lot of time is invested in it.
- **Post-reading:**
- It is the part where we are actually answering the questions.
- **What is the difference between reading and comprehending?**
- **Reading:**
- It means a particular person is familiar with alphabets and as a result, he can read sentences.
- **Comprehending:**
- It means whether you can decode the meaning.
- Are you able to understand the objective with which the author is writing?
- If you are comprehending that you will be able to frame an ideology in your mind.
- This ideology should be converted into action.
- If ideology is derived properly then arriving at action becomes easy.
- **Why answers become incorrect even after understanding the context?**
- Experiences and observations of the author may differ from the experiences and observations of the reader.
- Content has varied contexts.
- eg. Author may be talking about fruit Apple while the reader took it as the brand Apple.
- **CAP idea of reading comprehension:**
- C: Conclusion
- A: Assumption
- P: Premises
- Options form the premises, we assume based on these and then arrive at conclusion i.e Answers.
- eg. South Korean ambulance helicopters are crashing on regular basis.
- Now if you have already known about it, you will stick to what you already know rather than focus on the context of the question.
- While drawing conclusions kindly make sure that your assumptions should not be based on prior knowledge.
- You should stick to the context provided by the author.
- **OCTAVE:**
- O: Opinion
- C: Contrasting ideas
- T: Tone
- A: Avoid superlatives
- V: Verify your answers
- E: Eliminate wrong options
- The opinion is the mindset of the author.
- The contrasting idea means that particular part of the passage where you find that whatever ideology you have is not matching with the ideology of the author.
- eg. You are able to understand 1 paragraph but you missed his context in another paragraph.
- The tone in written format has to be picked from the words.
- A number of mistakes are due to misinterpretation of the tone.
- Comprehending the tone is a major challenge.
- The more sensitive the author gets the more progressive or regressive tone he is going to use.
- The tone of the author and answer should be the same.
- Superlatives should be avoided.
- Many times author is not claiming that his idea is the only way.
- Never try to pick options that are highly superlative in characters.
- The answer should also be verified. There are certain grounds that verify your answer.
- Always choose the best option, not the second-best.
- **Regression:**
- It means that you are re-reading the paragraphs, questions, and options.
- It is time-consuming.
- The basic ideology behind regression is that you are not able to establish the relation between the variables.
- It means that you are not able to understand the passage.
- It may happen when the passage is new to you.
- You are not able to relate the sentences and paragraphs.
- The jargon/terms may be so difficult that you are not able to comprehend them.
- **Ideas of dual thinking:**
- Stage 1:
- Whether you are having comfort or whether you score.
- Stage 2:
- You are framing ideas while reading.
- These ideas are about understanding, accuracy, time limit, etc.
- Stage 3:
- It takes place while answering.
- Here you are re-reading.
- **Solutions:**
- **Eye and Mind Coordination:**
- When the author is writing he is using his mind.
- He is writing with the objective of communicating his ideas.
- When a reader reads he reads with his eyes.
- His objective is to score.
- But here as a reader, we should also read with our mind.
- We should push our eyes faster to another word to read fast.
- Even if you don't understand a line, don't re-read it.
- **Manageable reading section:**
- In the subject, you already know how many lines you can understand without re-reading them.
- This is called the manageable reading section.
- To avoid regression, mark an anchor word in a particular group of lines.
- Margin word can be written.
- **Scanning and Skimming:**
- At first, read as fast as possible.
- It will give you a general idea.
- When you read that passage again you will get an idea that from where the question can come from.
- **Keywords:**
- In the second reading look for keywords and ideas/opinions.
- In key words you can look for:
- Positive words
- Negative words
- Examples etc.
- **Facts and opinions:**
- Strike off the general facts.
- By this, you won't be spending time re-reading them.
- **Slow thoughtful reading:**
- If the theme of the subject is new for you there you need to go slow.
- But you should be mindful at the same time.
- **Drill Down approach:**
- It means
- Depth
- Connect 
- Maturity
- Options should be as per the theme used by the author.
- A stronger theme requires strong options as answers.
- The same goes with maturity.
- **Mode of options:**
- **Extreme words** like only, always, never, everywhere, every time, etc.
- These extreme words claim a particular choice which is 100%.
- No deviation is there
- **Scope Trap:**
- Options that are very convincing but wrong.
- The entire line will be from a passage except for a word.
- **Mismatch:**
- Here the statement is partially correct and partially incorrect.
- **Single fact focus:**
- It means an exclusive question.
- The question is exclusive to a single problem.
- Your solution should also correspond to this.
- **According to the passage and according to the author:**
- Passage contains general facts as well as opinions of the author.
- When the question asks 'According to the Author' the first priority should be given to the opinion of the author.
- Facts should be considered in 'according to passage'.
- **Scoring technique:**
- It is helpful when all the options are correct.
- Analyze the options and chose the closest answer.

**The topic for the next class: The same topic will be continued.**
   

**Reading Comprehension Class02**  
**What is there in reading comprehension?**

- Words
- Keywords
- Tone

- You never want a positive concept to mature and decline.
- The authors may mention certain methods and solutions to preserve the positive concept.
- Negative implications can be highlighted while conveying the positivity of a topic.
- In negative concepts, causes are highlighted first.
- Solutions are also provided to solve the negative issue and most of the solutions are in the form of recommendations of various committees.
- If a negative topic is introduced then you would like it to decline.

- What should be read first: Question first or Options first or passage first?
- Reading options first is not advisable.
- The question can be read first only when you have prior knowledge of the subject.
- But the UPSC asks as per the passage.
- Reading options first will create an image in your mind and hence it is not advisable.
- The best way is to read the passage first.
- If you have no idea about the passage even then avoid reading it slowly.
- There is no relation between the speed of reading and understanding.
- Hence reading it slowly won't make it easier to understand.
- Instead, read it as fast as possible so that you can manage to read it twice or more than that.
- Sometimes they ask according to the passage and sometimes according to the author.
- When asked according to the author, the opinion of the author is important.
- When the question is according to the passage then facts and opinion should be considered.
- **Fixation time:**
- It is the time required to understand a passage.
- It is less when the topic is of interest or already known.
- Balance of memorization and perfection.

**Keywords:**

- Their main objective is to reduce the reading time.
- You don't have to read again and again if you have figured out the keywords.
- **There are 3 families of keywords:**
- **Continuity words:** Similarly, Likewise, Moreover, In the same way, Firstly, secondly, additionally, etc.
- **Contrasting words:** But, However, Although, Despite, Nonetheless, etc
- **Conclusion words:** At last, In summary, Therefore, Hence, etc.
- It means the author is trying to put forward his objective.
- It provides the core idea.

**Tone:**

- Tone can be mild, moderate, and extreme.
- A fact does not have a tone.
- Your reaction to a fact forms the tone.
- It is the expression of opinion.
- It is supported by facts and case studies.
- It can be:
- Factual: You are highlighting the fact.
- Critical: You are highlighting the pros and cons.
