**Practice Questions (at 10.03 AM)**  
**Practice Question on population (at 10.26 AM)**
 
**PROFIT and LOSS: (at 10.50 AM)**

- **Profit -----\> Increment (+)**
- **Loss -----\> Decrement (-)**
- **Cost price**
- **Selling price**
- **Cost price (Cp) + Profit (P) = Selling price (Sp)**
- **Profit = Sp - Cp.**
- **Profit is like change or something is getting increased in the cost price.**
- **% profit = (Sp - Cp)*100/Cp** #remember-for-later
- **% Loss = (Sp - Cp)*100/Cp**
- **Profit or loss always will be calculated on the basis of Cost price.**
- **When it is asking for %loss or %profit, we will try to find the ratio like Sp/Cp.**

**Maths Class 06**  
**(9:06 AM) Ratio:**
 - Suppose the if 72 is to be divided into the ratio of a/b = 5/3 means a =5 parts and b = 3 parts and there are total 8 parts
- Therfore 8 parts = 72 which means 1part = 72/8 = 9
- Hence a = 5x9 = 45 and b = 3x9 = 27
- Now suppose if 72 is to be divided in the ratio of a:b:c = 3:2:3 then
- a = (3/8) x 72 = 27
- b = (2/8) x 72 = 18
- c = (3/8) x 72 = 27
- If the ratio is multiplied or divide by same number the ratio will remain the same
- Addition and subtraction in ratio will change the ratios
-   
    
- **(9:21 AM) Q. A square is divided into 16 equal squares, some of the squares are completely coloured, some are uncolored and some of the squares are hald colored and hald uncolored, Ram is taking out one of the square then find which cannot be the ratio of colored and uncolored square?**
- a) 8:7            b) 7:8        c) 1:1           d) 8:9          answer is (d)
-   
    
- **Types of questions can be asked:**
- 1. If you are given a:b = 3:2 and b:c = 5:7 then find the ratio of a:b:c, make the common number equal
- 2. Another type can be asked if a:b, b:c, anc c:d are given and you have asked to find the ratio of a:b:c:d then do it in the same manner
- 3. If a:b:c is given and asked to find the value of a, b, and c
- 4. 2a=3b=4c, we can compare them and from here we can say that a/b = 3/2 and b/c = 4/3 and then apply the same method as explained in te above types
- **(9:47 AM) Q. Two numbers are in the ratio of 5:7. On diminishing each of them by 40 the become in the ratio 17:27. The difference between the numbers?**
- Solution: Lets take A/B = 5/7, A =5x and B = 7x
- Now (A-40) / (B-40) = 17/27
- (5x-40) / (7x-40) = 17/27 solve for x
- **Q. In a 100 litre of mixture of milk and water the ratio of Milk and water 3:1. How much water should be added in the mixtrue so that new ratio become 1:3?**

**Break 1:04 AM to  10:17 AM**

- Question on coins, 50 paisa, 25 paisa, 1 rupees coin
- If number of coins given then value of coin can be calculated by dividing the number by 1/2 for 50 paisa, 1/4 for 25 paisa and 1 fo 1rupee coin
- **Q. In a bag there are 25p, 10p, and 5p coins are in the ratio of 1:2:3. If there are 30rs in bag then find out 5p coins in bag?**
- **Solution:** change number fo coins into rupees
- 1:2:3 = x/4:2x/10:3x/20 = 30
- Take LCM to be 20 therefore the ratio will be 5x:4x:3x = 600 now calculate the value of x = 50
- Thus the number of 5 coins = 50x 3 = 150 coins is the answer
- **(10:47 AM) Q. If there are 25p, 50p, and 1 rupee coins in a bag in the ratio 1:2:3. If there are 300 rupees in the bag then find the 50p coins in the bag?**
- Solution: Find the number of coins 1:2:3 = x:2x:3x
- Change them in the value = x/4:2x/2:3x = 300
- 17x = 1200 ===\> x = 1200/17
- Q. A sum of rupees 2400 is distributed among x,y, and z in the ratio of 1/2:3/4:5/6. What is the difference between the maximum share and the minimum share? - **Q. A student appeared in 6 papers. the maximum marks are same for each paper, his marks in the papers are in the ratio 5:6:7:8:9:10. Overall he scored 60%. In howm many number of papers did he score less than 60% of the maximum marks?**
- **Solution:** 60% marks = 600 x 60/100 = 360 marks
- 5x+6x+7x+8x+9x+10x = 45x = 360 ==\> x=8
- 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 70 marks he got 
- Hence he score less than 60% in three papers which is the answer

**Break at 11:04 AM to 11:17 AM**

-   
    
- **Type 5 Income and Expenditure type**
- **Q. The monthly ncome of x and y are in the ratio of 4:3 and their expanses are in the ratio of 3:2. however each save rs 6000 per month. What is their total monthly income?**
- **Solution: (Income - Expenditure = Savings)**
- Xi/Yi =4/3 and Xe/Ye = 3:2
- Income of X = 4x and Y = 3x
- (4x-6000) / (3x-6000) = 3/2
- Solve for x = 6000
- Monthly income of X = 24000 and Y = 18000 thus totla monthly income = 42000 rs which is the answer
-   
    
- **Q. The total emoluments of two persons are the same but one get the allowance of the extent of 65% of his basic pay and other gets 80% of his basic pay. Find the ratio of the basic pay of the former to the basic pay of the latter?**
- Sollution = total emoluments = basic pay + allowance
- Suppose there are two persons A and B
- A = basic pay (BP1) + 65% of BP1
- B = BP2+80% of BP2
- A = B ===\> 165 BP1 = 180 BP2
- Thus BP1:BP2 = 180/165 = 16/13 ans
- **Q. In a class there are 18 very tall boys. If these consitutes 3/4th of the boys and the total number of boys is 2/3rd of total number ofs students in the class. What is the number of girls in the class?**
- **Solution:** 
- 3/4 = 18 (3 parts = 18, 1 part = 6)
- Total boys = 24
- 24 boys = 2/3 of total students
- thus total students = 36 hence total girls = 36-24 = **12 ans**
- **Q. Rahul and kamal have their monthly income in the ratio of 8:5 while their monthly expenditure are in the ration of 5:3. If theyr save monthly 12000 and 1000 respectively then difference in their monthly income is?**
- **Solution:**
- Income-Expenditure = Savings
- Income = Rahul:kamal = 8:5
- Expenditure = Rahul:Kamal = 5:3
- (8x-12000) / (5x-10000) = 5/3, solve for x = 14000
- The answer = 42000

**Maths Class 10**  
**(9:15 AM) Questions**

- **Q.1. (10+102+103+.....+10999 )/6 find out the remainder**
- Rule=  the remainder will get divided and multiplied according to the condition given in the question
- We can write the above equation as
- 10/6 + 100/6+......+109/6
- We get the remainder as 4+4+4+......
- Thus 4 comes 999 times hence we can also write it as 4x999 = 3996
- This will also be divided by 6 as 3996/6 = 0 will be the remainder - **Q.2. When n is divided by 5 it leaves the remainder 4. Find out when n2 is divided by 5 find out the remainder?**
- We can take n = 9 and n2 = 81
- Thus the remainder will be 1
-   
    
- **Q.3. Certain 3 digit number has the following characteristics;**
- **1. All the 3 digits are different**
- **2. The number is divisible by 7**
- **3. The number on reversing the digits is also divisible by 7** 
- **How many such 3 digit numbers are there?**
- Solution: a) 2   b) 4    c) 6    d)8
- We can write a number ABC = 100a+10b+c and similarly CBA can be written as 100c+10b+a
- Rule: If we take the difference between the two numbers which are divisible by 7 then the difference is also divisible by 7
- Thus we take the difference between the above two numbers = {99(a-c)}/7
- Thus we see from here that there are 4 possible cases;  1. a=9, c=2   2. a=8 c=1    3. a=1, c=8,    and 4. a=2, c=7 - **(10:04 AM) Q.4 X and Y are natural numbers other than 1 and Y is greater than X Which of the following represents the largest number**

- **Q.6. Let A3BC and DE2F be 4 digit numbers where each letter represents a different digit greater than 3. If the sum of the numbers is 15902, then what is the difference between the values of A and D?**
- Answer: Possibilities be (8,4) and (7,5)
- A3BC+DE2F = 15902
- Taking 1st possibility as A3B8 + DE24 = this makes the number as A378 + D524
- From here we can conclude that A =9 and D= 6 and hence the difference between A and D = 3 which is the answer
-   
    
- **Q.7. XYZ is a 3-digit number where (X+Y+Z) is not a multiple of 3. Then (XYZ+YZX+ZXY) is not divisible by?**
- Solution: XYZ = 100X+10Y+Z
- XYZ+YZX+ZXY = 100x+10y+Z+100Y+10Z+X+100Z+10X+Y = 111(X+Y+Z)
- 111 = 37 X 3, hence it is not divisible by 9 which is the answer
-

- **(11:32 AM) Q.14. 2147, find the unit digit?**
- Solution = these types of questions can be solved by the concept of cyclicity
- Rule: last two digits of the power / 4
- Here 47/4 and the remainder will be 3 hence the unit digit will be 23 = 8 will be the answer
- Another example 2197 = last two digits = 97 when divided by 4 leaves the remainder as 1 hence the answer will be 21 = 2 will be in the units place
- **For any number will it be applicable?**
- 5 to power anything you will get 5 at the units place and 6 to power anything will give you 6 at the units place
- For 3 the cyclicity will be 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1, hence the cyclicity will be 4 in this case also 
- For 4 the cyclicity will be 4, 6, 4, 6, and the cyclicity will be 2 and if the remainder comes out to be 0 then we take 2 itself as the power that is we take 42
- You can calculate it for other numbers as well in a similar manner
- **Q.15 Find the unit digit of 3175 X 4156?**
- Solution: For 3175 we use the cyclicity as 75/4 remainder will be 3 hence the unit place will be 33
- For 4156 use the cyclicity as 4x4x4x4 = 16x16 =6 will be at the unit's place 
- Therefore the digit at the unit's place will be found by multiplying 7x6 = 42 that is **2 will be at the unit's place**

**PERCENTAGE**

- By a certain percent, we mean that many hundredths.
- Thus, x percent means x hundredths, written as x%.
- To express x% : We have, x% =x/100.Thus, 20% =20/100
- X% of Y =x/y*100
- To calculate percentage change in value
- Percentage change = {change/(initial value)} x 100 .
- If A is x% more than B, then B is 100x/(100 + x) % more than A and vice versa.

**(9:15 AM) Questions**

- **Q.1. (10+102+103+.....+10999 )/6 find out the remainder**
- Rule=  the remainder will get divided and multiplied according to the condition given in the question
- We can write the above equation as
- 10/6 + 100/6+......+109/6
- We get the remainder as 4+4+4+......
- Thus 4 comes 999 times hence we can also write it as 4x999 = 3996
- This will also be divided by 6 as 3996/6 = 0 will be the remainder
- **Q.2. When n is divided by 5 it leaves the remainder 4. Find out when n2 is divided by 5 find out the remainder?**
- We can take n = 9 and n2 = 81
- Thus the remainder will be 1
- **Q.3. Certain 3 digit number has the following characteristics;**
- **1. All the 3 digits are different**
- **2. The number is divisible by 7**
- **3. The number on reversing the digits is also divisible by 7** 
- **How many such 3 digit numbers are there?**
- Solution: a) 2   b) 4    c) 6    d)8
- We can write a number ABC = 100a+10b+c and similarly CBA can be written as 100c+10b+a
- Rule: If we take the difference between the two numbers which are divisible by 7 then the difference is also divisible by 7
- Thus we take the difference between the above two numbers = {99(a-c)}/7
- Thus we see from here that there are 4 possible cases;  1. a=9, c=2   2. a=8 c=1    3. a=1, c=8,    and 4. a=2, c=7 - **(10:04 AM) Q.4 X and Y are natural numbers other than 1 and Y is greater than X Which of the following represents the largest number**
- Answer = A) XY
-   
    
- **Q.5 If X-Y = 8 then which one of the following will be true**
- **1.  Both X and Y must be positive for any value if X and Y**
- **2. If X is positive Y must be negative for any value of X and Y**
- **3. If X is negative Y must be positive for any value of X and Y**
- Answer = D) Neither 1 nor 2 nor 3
-   
    
- **Q.6. Let A3BC and DE2F be 4 digit numbers where each letter represents a different digit greater than 3. If the sum of the numbers is 15902, then what is the difference between the values of A and D?**
- Answer: Possibilities be (8,4) and (7,5)
- A3BC+DE2F = 15902
- Taking 1st possibility as A3B8 + DE24 = this makes the number as A378 + D524
- From here we can conclude that A =9 and D= 6 and hence the difference between A and D = 3 which is the answer
- **Q.7. XYZ is a 3-digit number where (X+Y+Z) is not a multiple of 3. Then (XYZ+YZX+ZXY) is not divisible by?**
- Solution: XYZ = 100X+10Y+Z
- XYZ+YZX+ZXY = 100x+10y+Z+100Y+10Z+X+100Z+10X+Y = 111(X+Y+Z)
- 111 = 37 X 3, hence it is not divisible by 9 which is the answer
- **Q.8.** Let p.q.r. and s are natural numbers such that p-2016 = q+2017 = r-2018 = s+2019, then which of the following is the largest number 
- **Q.9. A digit n\>3 is divisible by 3 but not divisible by 6. Which one is divisible by 4?** 
- Answer = A) 2n   B) 3n    C) 2n+4    D) 3n+1
- The answer is D) 3n+1
- **(10:59 AM) Q.10. What is the remainder when 51x27x35x62x75 is divided by 100?**
- **A) 50    B) 25     C) 5    D) 1**
- **Rule:** When we are dividing by 10 they are asking unit digit, when we are dividing by 100 they are asking last two digits
- In the above question the last digit will be 0 and hence in the given options only option A has 0 in the unit place and hence the answer will be A) 50
- **Q.11. A biology class at high school predicted that a local population of animals will double in size every 12 years...**
- Answer = D) P = 50 (2)n/12
- **Q.12. (1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! +.......+ 99!) /6 what will be the remainder**
- Answer = 1/6 + 2/6 + 6/6.....
- The remainder will be 3 only
- **Q.13. 1091x1092x1093......1099 find the unit digit**
- The answer will be 0 because there will be a pair of 2 and 5 which when multiplied gives 0
- **(11:32 AM) Q.14. 2147, find the unit digit?**
- Solution = these types of questions can be solved by the concept of cyclicity
- Rule: last two digits of the power / 4
- Here 47/4 and the remainder will be 3 hence the unit digit will be 23 = 8 will be the answer
- Another example 2197 = last two digits = 97 when divided by 4 leaves the remainder as 1 hence the answer will be 21 = 2 will be in the units place
- **For any number will it be applicable?**
- 5 to power anything you will get 5 at the units place and 6 to power anything will give you 6 at the units place
- For 3 the cyclicity will be 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1, hence the cyclicity will be 4 in this case also 
- For 4 the cyclicity will be 4, 6, 4, 6, and the cyclicity will be 2 and if the remainder comes out to be 0 then we take 2 itself as the power that is we take 42
- You can calculate it for other numbers as well in a similar manner
- **Q.15 Find the unit digit of 3175 X 4156?**
- Solution: For 3175 we use the cyclicity as 75/4 remainder will be 3 hence the unit place will be 33
- For 4156 use the cyclicity as 4x4x4x4 = 16x16 =6 will be at the unit's place 
- Therefore the digit at the unit's place will be found by multiplying 7x6 = 42 that is **2 will be at the unit's place**
