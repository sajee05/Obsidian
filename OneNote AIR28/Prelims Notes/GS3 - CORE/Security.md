### **Linkages between development and extremism:**
 
- Development refers to improvement in life, infrastructure, improvement in living standards.
- Development has a negative impact too, e.g. ==displacement== of people due to dam construction,
- ==Coal mining==, etc. In tribal areas may impact their environment, etc.
- At times development can be unbalanced.
- Extremism is a negative term, hence we have to understand the negative connotations of development too.
- Extremism: Rigid and radical ideology of promoting extreme political motives, often by violent means.
 
**Left-Wing Extremism:**
 
- The history of left, right division can be traced to the French Revolution.
- Left ideology and Right-wing ideology were born.
- With the advent of Karl Marx, the left-wing ideology seems to support Communism.
- Karl Marx calls for revolution.
- Further, in the era of Lenin, the rule of
- Tsar was termed exploitative and needs to be overthrown.
- Hence, Russian Revolution happened, which inspired the revolutions the world over, including the ideals of Bhagat Singh, etc.
- Further, Mao Zedong came up with Chinese Communism.
- This gave birth to the ideology of Maoism.
- In India==, Charu Mazumdar,== instigated an armed revolution in India, denouncing democracy.
- Charu Mazumdar opined that peasants of West Bengal were exploited by the landlords, etc.
- This movement was initiated in the ==Naxalbari District of Darjeeling, t==o replace the government with a communist system.
- He called for revolution through Barrels of the Guns, which started in the summer of 1967.
- In 2006, Dr. Manmohan Singh said that the biggest security challenge that India is facing is Naxalism, not the Kashmir issue.
- In 2010, in ==Dantewada, 76 CRPF pe==rsonnel were killed by the Naxals.
- 2013 : 25 leaders of the Indian National Congress were killed by the Naxals.
 
**Naxalism**

- Naxalism or Left Wing Extremism as a movement originated in the Naxalbari Area of Darjeeling District. 
- It was a movement that aimed at the overthrow of the exploitative zamindars and moneylenders. 
- LWE is inspired by Left Wing ideology and views of personalities such as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong.
- Even though the Naxalbari Movement was brought under control, within a few months, it ignited the imagination of communist revolutionaries, to replicate the same in other parts of the country. 
- It primarily started as an agrarian movement, but today, it has degenerated into a law and order problem.
- The ==area, affected by Naxal violence is often termed as the ‘Red Corridor’.==
- Former Rural Development Minister, Dr. Jairam Ramesh mentioned that the Red Corridor extends from Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh) to Pasupathi (Nepal).
- The objective of the Naxalites is to overthrow the Indian State and establish a communist state in India.
- This movement that started from one district in 1967, gradually expanded its fangs, to more than 180 districts by the year 2009. 
 
**Land related factors:** 

- Development induced displacement, e.g. dams, etc. 40% people displaced after independence are tribals.
- Forced evictions, 
- Alienation of land, etc.
- Non-implementation of constitutional safeguards, such as Article 244, Scheduled areas, Tribes Advisory Councils (TAC), etc. have not been properly implemented.
 
**Vacuum of governance:**

- Poor implementation of Schemes and programs.
- There are also vested interests, the political interests of the people in Naxalism.
- Naxalism has a vested interest in keeping these areas as poor.
- There had been overt and covert support to Naxalism by China.
- At least 40 Maoists of India received their training in Nepal.
- In form of nexus between corrupt officials and Naxalites, the vacuum exists.
- Socio-economic backwardness is also a reason for Naxalism.
 
**Evolution of Naxalism in India:**

- ==Phase I was 1967-1971== (started from Naxalbari, spread to Odisha, Bihar, etc.)
- Largely the movement was around ==agrarian issues.==
- Mostly in rural areas and some support from urban areas.
- The death of Charu Mazumdar culminated in the first phase of Naxalism.
- ==Second phase: 1980s-2004.==
    
    - Gradual expansion of Naxalism took place.
    - Two major centres were: Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.
    - Bengal was out of the focus during 2nd phase.
    - Expansion of Naxalism in Maharashtra, Karnataka, etc.
    - After the 1990s the Naxalism further expanded, due to privatization, mining licensing, etc.
    - More industries were allowed to mine in the tribal areas, etc.
- ==Third Phase: 2004 onwards.==
    
    - This was the phase of rapid expansion of Naxalism and violence.
    - CPI (Maoist) was formed due to the Maoist Communist Center of Bihar and PWG of Andhra Pradesh.
    - Naxalism in post-2010 era, Naxalism has been limited to fewer areas in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, etc.
 
**State approach towards Naxalism:**
 
- **Developmental approach.**
    
    - Panchayati Raj Extension to Scheduled Areas,
    - Recognizing the rights of tribals on minor forest produce, etc.
    - Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana etc. #remember-for-later
    - District Mineral Development Fund, some portion of this fund goes into developmental aspects in tribal areas.
    - Civic Action Program.
    - Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.
    - Backward Region Grant Fund (BRGF) by Planning Commission,
    - Now BRGF has been replaced by the Aspirational District Programme by NITI Aayog.
    - Prabhari Officer: Senior Officer with 10-12 years experience, to coordinate with civil society, public etc. in the Aspirational Districts.
    - Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy of 2007 : Rules to be followed when people are displaced due to displacement, etc.
    - This Policy included guidelines about steps to be taken, relief etc. in case of displacement.
    - ==Eklavya Schools:== For tribal children, residential schools have been set up.
    - Various state governments have taken steps, e.g. Chhattisgarh Government's Chulo Asman, etc.
 
- **Law and Order approach:**
    
    - Modernization of Police Forces,
    - Civic Action Programme,
    - Media Action Plan: To launch aggressive media campaigns to overcome the propaganda of Naxals.
    - Security-related expenditure.
    - Special Anti-Naxal Forces in some of the states, e.g. Greyhound in Andhra Pradesh.
    - Capacity building of State Police forces is being focused, with funds also coming from the Union.
    - Special incentives to the police personnel involved in special, elite forces like Greyhound. 
    - Joint Patrolling is being conducted in border areas.
    - Deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to deal with Naxals.
    - Joint Command Center (unified command) for the central armed police forces.
    - Surrender and Rehabilitation Policy.
    - However, surrender alone is not enough, upskilling and employment are also important to wipe out Naxalism.
 
**Shortcomings of the State’s approach:**

- A casual approach towards Naxalism.
- States have more knowledge about local areas, terrain, etc.
- For example, Andhra Pradesh was successful because it focused on State police-led approach.
- Lack of coordination between the States: Often states do not coordinate among themselves.
- ==Samadhan doctrine==: Smart, Actionable, etc. for providing a comprehensive approach to deal with Naxalism in the country.
    
    - ![samadhan INSIGHTSIAS](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607050841-0.jpeg)
      
    
- The exact implementation of the Samadhan Scheme is doubtful in many aspects.
- Lack of coordination between Police and Civil Administration.
- Over-dependence on central forces like CRPF, etc.
   

**Andhra Pradesh Model:**

- Andhra Pradesh abolished the Patta system and ==brought land reforms.==
- Andhra Pradesh established clear land titles.
- They started food grains at cheaper rates, to pull out people from poverty.
- Setting up of elite anti-Naxal forces.
- ==K Vijay Kumar== was instrumental in the success of Greyhounds.
- ==Salwa Judum==: Vigilante groups to watch out for Naxal activities.
 
**Questions:** 

- Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) is showing a downward trend, what are the steps taken by the government for the same?
- Is non-implementation of the Fifth Schedule one of the reasons for the spread of Left Wing Extremism?
- Do you agree that the establishment of large-scale industries in backward areas is one of the reasons for people taking up the path of Naxalism? Discuss.   
- **Solutions to Left Wing Extremism:**
    
    - Incentives to officers posted in LWE areas.
    - Th==e== Forest Rights Act ==needs to be revised, to i==nclude more rights to the tribals.
    - For example, minor forest produce, timber, etc. are to be recognized in the names of tribals.
    - In the name of conservation, the rights of tribals should not be taken away.
    - Forest Rights Act-2006 has also become a tool of bureaucratic exploitation.
    - For example, approvals are to be taken from the State Forest Department.
    - Mafia and Bureaucratic nexus can result in the failure of the Forest Rights Act.
    - The ==Central Tribal Advisory Council s==hould be formed to provide leadership.
    - Duplication of schemes and efforts should be minimized.
    - The Supreme Court directed the complete disbanding of Salwa Judum, citing it is the State’s responsibility to fight Naxals, not the common people.
 
## **Terrorism**
 
- They want to create terror ==in== the minds of people.
- They do not discriminate on basis of state and people, etc.
- For example==,== 26/11 Mumbai Attack==, the person killed is not a real target.==
- To create terror and panic in society.
- Terrorism can be used by states, e.g. Pakistan uses it to advance its strategic interests.
 
**Insurgency:**

**Insurgency In Assam**

- (Refer to the handouts)
- Insurgency in Assam was started in 1979 by ULFA(United Liberation Front of Assam).
- But the background of insurgency can be traced to the All Assam Student's Union(AASU) which was an anti-alien movement in the 1960s.
- It was against the illegal immigrant movement.
- Their main demand was that all the illegal immigrants and outsiders should be deported.
- From 1979 to 1985 thee were violent incidents occurred in Assam mostly led by ULFA.
- They argued that the demography of Assam was being inverted and they wanted sovereignty and separation of Assam from India.
- In ==1985 Assam Accord w==as signed between The Government of India, the State Government of Assam, and AASU.
- But still their many demands remained unfulfilled.
- Their major demand was that anyone who migrated to Assam between 1961 to 1971 would be provided with residency in Assam but without voting rights for 10 years.
- Anyone who migrated to Assam Post 1971 was to be declared illegal and had to be deported.
- Finally the Supreme Court of India ordered the central govt to conduct NRC and to find the number of illegal immigrants.
- However the ULFA's influence and support from the public had declined.
- But since the 1990s there is a rising demand for Bodoland as a separate state for the ==Bodo's who are the largest ethnic group in Assam.==
- Bodo insurgency was also started by a student protest group ==All Bodo Student Union(ABSU).==
- Then insurgency was led by BLT & NDFB.
- But the creation of the Bodo Autonomous Territorial Region(BATR) under VI schedule and various agreements have mostly controlled the insurgency.
 
**Insurgency In Meghalaya & Tripura:**

- (Refer to the handouts)
- Insurgency in Meghalaya is because of :
    
    - a. Illegal Immigration.
    - b. The ==threat of identity loss is due to ethnic conflicts== among the various ethnic groups.
- In Tripura:
    
    - Insurgency is mainly because of illegal migration and inversion of demography.
    - But in the year 2015 AFSPA was revoked from Tripura, so the insurgency here was also mostly wiped out.
    - No insurgent group as such in Arunachal Pradesh.
 
**Factors responsible for the insurgency in NE:**
 
- (Refer to the handouts)
- 1. Historical Factors:  #remember-for-later
    
    - Colonial pas did not integrate NE into mainland India as Britishers did not have enough control over the NE.
- 2. Geographical Factors: #remember-for-later
    
    - Lack of physical connectivity with the rest of the county which caused poor or lack of integration of NE with mainland India.
    - Porous Borders with the neighbouring country.
    - Difficult Terrain & Topography which is very uneven and rugged topography makes it suitable for gorilla warfare.
    - Poor development of infrastructure which is an outcome of geographical factors.
- 3. Socio-economic Factors:  #remember-for-later
    
    - Lack of industrialization leading to unemployment.
    - Lack of basic infrastructure.
- 4. Lack of devolution of autonomy: #remember-for-later
    
    - Unfulfillment of political aspirations of various ethnic groups.

    - Ethnic diversity coupled with lack of resources led to conflicts for control over the scarce resources.
- ==6. Culture of Violence:== Prevalence of organized crime in the region.
- 7. Psychological Isolation:  #remember-for-later
    
    - It is the result of improper cultural and physical integration, lack of coverage in media, and lack of awareness among mainland Indians about NE
- 8. External Factors:  #remember-for-later
    
    - For example covert support from China.
- 9. Illegal Immigration: 
    
    - Inversion of demography led to fear of loss of cultural identities.
- 10==. Drawing of the boundaries is done in an ad-hoc manner r==esulting in a lack of representation/inclusion of various ethnic groups.
 
**The steps that are taken for the Integration of NE:**
 
- (Refer to the handouts)
- A. Security Front:
    
    - Introduction of Laws like ==UAPA, 1967.==

- Proceeds of Crime: The money that has been earned through illegal sources or criminal activities.
- Money Laundering: Projection of proceeds of crime to legal authorities as if they have been earned through the legal sources is what is called money laundering.
- Objectives of ML:
    
    - a. To hide the crime or criminal activity behind that money.
    - b. To enjoy the value of that money.
- So the conviction of people in the PML, Act is very low as it is difficult to prove both the offense and attempt to show that money as legal money.
 
**Hawala Transactions**
 
- (Explained with flow charts)
- It is a parallel remittance system.
- They have a parallel system like informal banking with runs on trust.

- (Explained with flow charts)
- ![What is Money Laundering Three Methods or Stages i...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607050843-1.jpeg) - 1. Placement: 
    
    - It is introducing or placing the money into the formal financial system.
    - This is the riskiest stage in the entire process.
    - It is done in several ways like smurfing/structuring deposits so that it does not alarm the authorities.
    - Other ways are the currency exchange, investment in real estate, buying some luxury assets, etc.
- 2. Layering: 
    
    - In this stage, the launderer performs multiple transactions over the money to take it as far as possible from the source.
    - It is done by the sale and purchase of luxury assets multiple times, electronic transactions from one jurisdiction to another.
    - Here hawala transactions play a very important role.
- 3. Integration: 
    
    - In this stage, the money is finally integrated into the formal economy and shown as if it was earned by legal means to the authorities.
    - Here shell or fake companies are a patent tool.
    - Fake invoices, fake exports, FDI routes, etc are the other ways.

    - When a nation directly or through proxy causes damage to the critical infrastructure of the other nation, For example, Stuxnet
    - Stuxnet went on to infest the Iranian Nuclear Program and damage the progress of the same.
   

- **Cases of cyber breaches:**
    
    - The leak of personal information of 3.2 million debit cards in 2016
    - Data Theft At Zomato (2017), Wannacry Ransomware (2017), PETYA Ransomware (2017), etc.
    - In today's news, Russia's Space program is hacked 
 
- **Need for Cyber Security in India:**
    
    - National Security Imperative - to build a resilient cyber-infrastructure that is hackproof
    - Increasing Importance of Digital Economy - entire transaction has started to move slowly towards digitization, UPI, NEFT, Payment Wallets, etc.
    - Securing Data - Oil for 21st-century economy = data is the new fuel, it's importance in the 21st century
    - The Internet penetration rate in India went up to nearly around 45% in 2021, from just about 4% percent in 2007.
 
- **Steps were taken by the Indian Government:**
    
    - **1) Legal/Policy Front:**
        
        - **IT Act, 2000 -** ==Section 66D== identity theft, ==Section 66F f==or cyber terrorism, ==Section 66E== for denial of access, ==Section 67A== deals with voyeurism, ==Section 66B f==or child pornography, etc.
        - **Infosec awareness-** The website provides over 1,000 workshops tailored to inform government, academic, and general internet users about software security, popular attacks, and computer terminology
        - **National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP), 2013 -** Needs to be revisited again as it is a decade-old policy and many new things have emerged that need to be dealt with.
   

- **The Policy proposes to:**
    
    - Set up different bodies to tackle various levels of threats, along with a national nodal agency, to coordinate all matters related to cyber security. **CERT-in** is created which will provide a response, analyse and prevent cyber threats.
    - Create a National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC)
    - Create a workforce of around 500,000 trained in cyber security in five years.
    - Provide fiscal benefits to businesses to adopt best security practices.
    - Set up testing labs to regularly check the safety of equipment being used in the country.
    - Create a cyber ecosystem in the country, developing effective public-private partnerships and collaborative engagements through technical and operational cooperation.
    - Building indigenous security technologies through research
    - Recent threats evolved = IP Spoofing, a man in the middle attack (MITM), etc.
 
- **Limitations of the National Cyber Security Policy, 2013:**
    
    - The poor manufacturing base of the electronic items
    - Lack of involvement and incentivizing private sector
    - Poor capacity in terms of human development, etc,
      
    
 
- **2) Institutional steps:**
    
    - Cert-In (Computer Emergency Response Team- India)
    - Sectoral Certs have been developed by various ministries like the Ministry of Power, etc.
    - National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC)
    - Cyber Swachhta Kendra, etc. - **Challenges in Protecting Critical Infrastructure:**
    
    - **Internal Resources:** Many organizations including those that help to maintain Critical Infrastructure do not have enough trained security professionals to meet their security needs.
    - **Reluctance in Sharing Information:** Fear of losing a competitive edge over rivals inhibits the private and public sector to share information about the vulnerability of their systems.
    - **Lack of coordination among agencies:** Some of the agencies report to the Ministry of Home Affairs, while others report to the Prime Minister’s Office, Defence ministry, MeitY, etc.
    - **Capability Asymmetry:** India lacks indigenization in hardware as well as software cybersecurity tools. This makes India’s cyberspace vulnerable to cyberattacks motivated by state and non-state actors
   

- **Challenges with respect to cyber-security:**
    
    - Lack of awareness
    - Lack of adequately trained workforce
    - Lack of budget/investment
    - Lack of coordination between different agencies
    - Imported Telecom equipment -India imports around 70%
    - Data privacy : Absence of comprehensive data protection law
    - Overdependence of government agencies on the external server
 
- **Budapest Convention**
    
    - Proposed in 2001 by western countries and came into effect in 2004
    - It serves as a guideline for any country developing comprehensive national legislation against Cybercrime and as a framework for international cooperation between state parties to this treaty.
    - **India has not signed the convention** - India's concerns
        
        - a) it is not universally applicable and is applicable to member countries only, 
        - b) India was not involved in consultation during the framing stage
        - c) Highly biased towards the western world
        - d) Seen as a mode to sell expensive technologies by west
        - e) Sovereignty issues
            
            - Also lays down specific standards that are to be enforced for cybersecurity around the world
            - Technology and resources sharing to curb cybersecurity threat 
 
- **Arguments in favour of India joining the Convention:**
    
    - a) India can influence the future of the treaty by becoming its member
    - b) Access to the latest and cheap technology as India will be designated as a priority country
    - c) Formulate comprehensive data protection act, so now apprehensions left regarding concern over data sovereignty
 
**Suggestions or Way Forward:**

- The articulation of a comprehensive national cyberspace strategy;
- The technological development of cyber security capabilities;
- The development of human resources and human capital at operational levels;
- A synchronized governance/organizational structure;
- Training and assimilating a cyber force for offensive and defensive operations. 
 
**Recommendations of** **Gulshan Rai Committee and Inderjeet Rao Committee:**
  - Creation of Cybercrimes cell in each state and district
- Appropriate certification for the adoption of best practices
- More research and development is required
- Also, train manpower to enhance the capacity
- Internet servers should be hosted within the country, e.g. RBI has imposed data localization for banks
- Regular and consistent changes should be brought in the IT Act and other legislation to tackle cyber threat
- A separate agency should be created to deal with the data breach
- Stringent penalty provisions should be placed to deter individuals and agencies from misusing private data
 
### **Social Media:**
 
- It helps in enhancing the reach for the govt agencies
- It helps in seeking feedback from the citizens.
- It is used for real-time engagement 
- It can be used for managing perception
- Social Media Labs = Prone to radicalization, detect the internal threats
- National Face Recognition Software = to avert threats, to create a social database, 
- Bust rumours and fake news
 
- **Threats that social media is posing to India's Internal Security:**
    
    - Fake news = threat to life, a threat to communal harmony (e.g. Muzaffarnagar Riots 2013), 
    - Used for organizing mob violent attack = London Riots 2012
    - Promotion of Pornography and Obscenity 
    - Used for cyberbullying and harassment at times leads to sexual crimes
    - Used as a tool to snoop on individuals and also determine and guide their behavior, e.g. Cambridge Analytica Issue
    - Used by terrorist organizations
    - Social networking sites are the biggest threat in terms of malware, spyware, etc.
 
- **It is difficult to overcome these challenges:**
    
    - Huge and expanding number of users
    - Ineffectiveness of censorship on content and impact on freedom of speech
    - Difficulty in prosecution and tracking of crime due to jurisdiction problems and anonymity offered by the internet.
    - Lack of geographical boundaries makes social media regulation an arduous task
    - Lack of digital literacy amongst people
    - Artificial Intelligence is still new and is in its early stages of development and cannot be used to regulate the sector.
 
- **Way forward:**
    
    - Responsible use of social media must be taught by increasing digital literacy
    - Strengthening of cyber security organizations and IT cells of law enforcement agencies
    - Data protection and privacy must be enhanced, etc.
    - Other things to be referred to from the handout
 
**Challenges created by Media into India's Internal Security:**

- **1. Sensationalisation of News**, e.g. ==Hijacking of IC814== created a panic amongst the policymakers, political leaders, it is a threat to national security issues
- **2. Trivialization of national security issues** = in the name of national news debates on the news channels, it can lead to a situation where the decision would be influenced by populous demand
- **3. Irresponsible coverage of anti-terror operations** e.g, 26/11 attacks were covered irresponsibly led to damage to the operation, hot pursuit/surgical strike of Indian Army into Myanmar when they are chasing insurgents of NCN-(K), putting their lives in threat by relieving their identity.
- **4. Irresponsible Coverage of communal issue/conflict** = news channel deliberately try to identify the rioters, trouble mongers, with one or the other specific community.
- **5. Irresponsible coverage of victims of terrorist Attacks/heinous crimes** = further spreading the terror and helping the terrorist achieve their objectives by showing such news
- **6. Paid News =** tool to justify entry of criminals into politics, glorification of criminals, extremists
 
**Positive Roles of Media:**
  - **1. Role Played by Indian Media Agencies during the Kargil war:**
    
    - Because of this, we were able to turn the opinion of the international community in favour of India. 
- **2. The role played by the media after the shooting down** of the Pakistan navy Petrol plane by the Indian Air Force in Aug 1999, Indian media swayed the opinion of ICJ and the global community in India's Favour.
- **3. Role played by Media in ensuring Communal Harmony:** a number of journalists were part of Track-2 and Track-3 diplomacy initiatives to normalize the relationship with Pakistan.
- **4. Role in busting the fake news and propaganda of extremists =** Media have been a crucial partner for the govt in busting the fake news and propaganda of extremists
 
**Best practices of media on regulations around the world**
 
### **Various Security Agencies and their Mandate:**
 
- Security Agencies can be divided into - 
    
    - a) Enforcement Agencies = the armed forces (defence production, organizational setup, integrated theatre command),
        
        - CAPF, State Police
    - b) Intelligence Agencies = RAW, IB, NTRO
    - c) Investigating Agencies = NIA, CBI
 
- **Issues related to Functioning of Intelligence Agencies of India:**
    
    - **IB =** established by the Britishers against the Indian freedom fighters, till 1968 major responsibility was to provide all the kinds of intelligence inputs to the govt and various security agencies including the armed forces with respect to internal security as well as any external threats,
    - Intelligence has objectives of preventive and offensive, after 1968 - IB comes under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will focus on internal threats, and **RAW** comes under Prim Minister Office (PMO) will focus on external threats from outside
    - NTRO is created in 2004 with the objective of providing technical intelligence inputs, is under control of PMO
 
- **Issues =** No role is defined of these agencies in any law, they have been created through an executive order, they have overlapping functions, they also have ego-tussles, IB is used for spying on political adversaries by the govt in power, 
    
    - **1. Overlapping functions =** it leads to ineffective and inefficiency in their functions, duplication in efforts, setting accountability becomes difficult
    - **2. Lack of legislative oversight** often leads to the political misuse of these agencies by the executive.
    - 3. Turf War between various intelligence agencies
    - 4. Shortage of workforce = specifically technical workforce (cyber security experts, forensic experts, etc.)
    - 5. Lack of R&D on the technical intelligence front as well as a shortage of resources.
   

- **Reforms Needed:**
    
    - 1. Must be provided the legal framework
    - 2. Reforms in their recruitment and training process
    - 3. Broad-based recruitment framework including experts from outside
    - 4. Bring all of them under one leader who will be supervising and control on them
    - 5. Promotion of transparency and accountability
    - 6. Empowerment of intelligence officials, autonomy in exercising powers
 
- **Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF):**
    
    - To supplement the law and order issues in the state, e.g. the issue of Naxalism
    - Sometimes also called as Paramilitary Forces = like Assam Rifles, Indian Coast Guard, 
    - Various CAPF = CRPF, BSF, ITBP, CISF, SSB, NSG
   

- CAPF in India comprises seven police forces that function under the Union Government- Ministry of Home Affairs.
- They include- Assam Rifles, Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Indo Tibetan Border Police, National Security Guard, and Sashastra Seema Bal.
- They are created to aid the state police forces, when the state police forces cannot tackle an issue, for example, **Naxalism.**
 
- **Issues associated with the functioning of CAPFs, as pointed out by** **Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi Committee****:**
    
    - **Human resources issues:**
        
        - The personnel across the ranks are overworked and understaffed.
        - High attrition rates- Between 2010-13, more than 42,000 resigned.
        - Many could not get leave for months at stretch.
        - There is a shortage of up to 20%in the cadre.
        - Work-related stress sees instances of skirmishes among the jawans and even between jawans and officers.
        - They have very high rates of suicide.
        - Outdated training and equipment are used.
        - Lack of motivation as the promotional avenues are very less as compared to Indian Police Services.
        - Repeated instances of para-dropping IPS officers as Director General of the forces are seen.
        - It affects the morale of junior officers and also of the cadre officers of the same force.
 
- **Operational issues:**
    
    - Overdependence of states on the centre: CAPF has become the main point of response in the case of breakdown of law and order, while they are ideally supposed to only complement the actions of the state police.
    - Due to this, states postpone their own police capacity development.
    - It is possible that the CAPF personnel are not best equipped to deal with the local challenges such as in Naxal-affected areas.
    - The outsiders posted in critical areas may lack the required sensitivity, which may culminate in widening the trust deficit.
    - Lack of time to rest and recuperation between two deployments.
    - This also results in a lack of training for capacity building.
    - Posting of border guarding forces in the hinterland (election duty, riot control, VIP protection, etc).
    - This creates issues on both sides - border areas see manpower shortage and the border guarding forces are not trained enough for hinterland operations.
    - The personnel faces poor food quality, and poor medical facilities- Malaria remains the biggest cause of casualties in the Chhattisgarh belt.
    - Shortage of weaponry and arms which is up to 25% for certain forces.
 
- **Infrastructural issues**
    
    - The members of the CAPFs have very few, and dilapidated accommodation facilities for themselves and their families.
    - Out of the planned 24000 houses for the personnel as per the 12th five-year plan, only 50 % has been completed
    - Poor living conditions in the barracks.
    - For temporary deployment like Elections, the CAPF personnel are lodged in government schools, community halls, etc. This is in stark contrast to army personnel who stay
 
- **Recommendations as per the** **Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi Committee:**
    
    - Capacity development of States.
    - Updation of the training curriculum and infrastructure in training institutes for CAPFs.
    - CAPF must hold regular consultations with the states for timely availability of land for building housing facilities.
    - Better promotional avenues for the serving workforce.
    - Top positions should be filled from the respective cadre of the CAPF.
    - Workshops on stress management should regularly be undertaken, and yoga and meditation be made part of the daily exercise for CAPF personnel.￼ 

### **Border Management**
 
- Border management is slightly different from Border Security.
- The Border Management division of the Ministry of Home Affairs says that border management is securing the country’s borders against interests hostile to the country and putting in place the systems that are able to prohibit such elements while facilitating legitimate trade and commerce.
- Border Security refers to the task of protecting the territory or borders from hostile elements- Traffickers, infiltrators, and terrorists.
- Border Management also includes the development of border areas so as to make borders a tool to promote cultural and economic cooperation.
- An initiative like Border Haats on the India- Bangladesh border is a very helpful initiative
 
**Issues with border management:**
 
- Some of our ==maritime boundaries are still undefined== ==a==nd much of our l==and borders are not demarcated== on the ground. 
- The disputed and unsettled nature of our boundaries has made them a source of tension and made they're policing much more difficult.
- Since many of our borders are ==man-made artificial boundaries== ==and not based on natural feature==s such as rivers, watersheds, etc, they are extremely porous and easy to cross.
- ==Too many borders guarding force==s at the same border-Assam rifles, SSB, and ITBP with different standard operating procedures leads to a ==lack of uniformity and coordination.==
- The lack of mechanisms for sharing intelligence.
- This also causes accountability issues.
- Posting of border guarding forces in hinterlands for many kinds of duties.
- The ==disregard for the concerns of the local population== in the border areas.
- The initiative of the **Village Voluntary Community** can be very helpful for public connection in the border areas
- Among the border guarding forces, there is no institutional mechanism to share intelligence.
- ==Infrastructure issues i==n places like Ladakh.
- Even Border Roads Organisation(BRO) is overstretched.
- Now BRO has been allowed to outsource its operations to private contractors and enter into PPP.
- The border areas of India are in the vicinity of some of the most ==disturbed regions such as Afghanistan and Myanmar.==
- External state actors have also played a major role in promoting instability in the border areas.
 
**Poor Border Management affects Internal security as:**

- **Militancy i****n certain areas:** Porous borders have caused separatism in Punjab, and are still causing issues in Kashmir and Nort East.
- **Organized crimes****:** Poor border management remains the largest cause for transnational drug trafficking, smuggling, flesh trade, etc.
- **Naxalism:** ==Tradi==tionally, many Maoist outfits have had safe havens in Nepal. 
    
    - Youth are more prone to get attracted to extremism because of poor economic development of border areas 
 
**The way ahead in improving border management**
 
- Involvement of local communities. For example the Village Volunteer Communities.
- Outsourcing the development of border infrastructure to relieve Border Roads Organisation of the workload and timely completion of border infrastructure.
- Deepening the diplomatic ties with our neighbours.
- Coordinated training exercises and ==anti-insurgent exercises with neighbours. F==or exampl==e-== **Operation All Clear** ==with Bhutan== and Bangladesh.
- **Naresh Chandra /Kargil Review committee** had suggested that o==ne border must be guarded by one force only.==   
- **Role of technology in Border Management:**
    
    - It can play a crucial role in facilitating Cross Border Trade, like hassle-free ==QR code-enabled check posts== for speedy movement of trucks.
    - Integrated Check post
    - Technology is more capable of reaching areas with difficult terrains as compared to humans.
    - ==24/7 surveillance== can be made possible with the help of technology.
    - **Madhukar Gupta** ==Committee== on border protection recommended the adoption of technological measures to improve intelligence inputs and surveillance.
    
**CIBMS:** **Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System:**

- CIBMS is an integration of a number of new gadgets and technologies to ensure electronic surveillance of borders. “an integration of humans and technology with th==e Command and Control centre at the heart of it.==
- CIBMS involves the deployment of a range of state-of-the-art surveillance technologies — ==thermal imagers, infra-red and laser-based intruder alarms, aerostats for aerial surveillance, unattended ground sensors== that can help detect intrusion bids, radars, and sonar systems to secure riverine borders, ==fibre-optic sensors== and a command and control system that shall receive data from all surveillance devices in real time.
- Implementation of CIBMS projects on the Indo-Pakistan, and Indo - Bangladesh borders will enhance the capabilities of the Border Security Force (BSF).  
 
-  **Some concerns with CIBMS:**
    
    - There are questions regarding their compatibility with Indian conditions( Cold weather of Siachen, Heavy rains on the Indo- Bangladesh border) and their cost-effectiveness.
    - There have been many delays in the full-fledged implementation as its pilot projects began back in 2016.
    - CIBMS intends to use a variety of sensors, such as Thermal Imager, Radar, Aerostat, Optical Fiber Intrusion Detection system, Unattended Ground Sensors, underwater sensors, etc and we do not have much indigenous manufacturing capacity.
    - In the recent past, the optimum use of sophisticated technical equipment has been weighed down by its incompatibility with the terrain and existing border security infrastructure. 
    - This time serious questions have been raised about the three-phase power supply and border road along with fencing. 
    - Power back-up of the power gensets is also a challenge.
    - The technology is expensive, and it may not be possible to implement it across all borders.
    - India has not developed an indigenous capacity for border management surveillance.
    - Basic amenities have not been improved on the ground.
    - Lake of trained workforce and the training capacity.
 
### **External threats to India’s internal security**
 
**Bangladesh:**
 
![INDIABANGLADESH Mount Everest CHINA Kula Kangri BH...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607050844-2.gif)- ==Illegal immigratio==n across five decades; in 2002, it was estimated that India housed ==more than 12 million illegal immigrants== from Bangladesh.
- Apart from economic issues, it can also ==fuel insurgency as we saw in Assam, Tripura,== etc.
- One of the main demands of the insurgent groups like ULFA has been strict steps against foreigner influx.
- Illegal immigration has resulted in demographic inversion and ==identity threats== in some states like Assam, and Tripura( it became a Bengali majority state from a tribal majority state after 1970).
- It has furthe==r created a scarcity of resources f==or India.
- Bangladesh is a major destination fo==r illegal cattle smuggling, e==stimated at around 1 lakh/year for affordable nutrition for most of its population.
- This will cause both economical and communal issues in India considering the cultural significance of cattle in India.
- Bangladesh has been both an important source and destination f==or human trafficking.==
- It has resulted in promoting India as a destination as well as a transit hub for the Middle -East for flesh trade and other illegal activities.
- Presence of insurgent groups on the Indo-Bangladesh border. 
- Historically, the BNP party regime in Bangladesh has supported northeastern insurgents.
- The issue ==of Rohingyas re==mains a very polarising issue in India due to both security and economic concerns.
- As these refugees are very destitute, they are more prone to radicalization or other criminal activities.
- Growing fundamentalism in Bangladesh has spillover effects in India and a number of communally charged incidents can arise.
- ==China is== getting closer to Bangladesh, with multiple deals; China now has access to two of its largest seaports—Chittagong and Mongla. 
 
**India-Myanmar Border**
 
![Exported image](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607050846-3.jpeg)- Myanmar has been providing safe havens for many ==North Eastern insurgent== groups like NSCN.
- Indian proximity to the **Golden Triangle** has made India a transit as well as a consumer country.
![INDIA THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE CHINA Yunnan Mandalay MY...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607050850-4.png)- The Rohingya destitute are most prone to radicalization.
- The 16-km **Free Movement Regime** along the border is been used for smuggling and trafficking.
- The proximity between China and Myanmar.￼  
**India-Nepal:**
 
![RAKHAND Bareilly sLak UTTAR PRADESH Lucknow Kanpur...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607050852-5.jpeg)- There have been increased attempts for the radicalization of youths by ==Maoist organization==s on the Indo –Nepal border.
- In 2009, 40 ==insurgents in Kashmir h==ad been ==trained== in Nepal.
- Nepal has been a source of various ==fake Indian currency rackets.==
- Various ==organized criminal groups== operate along the Indo-Nepal border.
- Also, a large number of organized criminals seek refuge in Nepal due to the open border regime.
- Nepal border has been a major source of ==drug trafficking==, and also earlier during the insurgency in Punjab Nepal.
- There has been increasing proximity to China; more than 2000 government-run schools now teach Mandarin and the required funding and other support come from China; along with heavy infrastructural investments.  
**Challenges posed by Afghanistan to India's internal security:**
 
- The resurgence of the Taliban could see ==radicalism getting spilled== over in India.
- Afghanistan is the hub of ==Narco-Trafficking across== the world through the **Golden Crescent**.
![TRAFFICKING TRENDS](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607050854-6.jpeg)- Presence of external forces in Afghanistan.  
**Challenges posed by Sri-Lanka to Indian internal security:**
 
- The civil war and ==Tamil crisis== have had effects on domestic politics in India( there has been and still is a very strong demand in Tamil Nadu for the commutation of the sentence of the killers of  Rajiv GandhiJ ).
- In 2016, India voted against Sri Lanka in a **UNHRC** resolution on military excesses. That caused Srilanka to get closer to China.
- Chinese presence at **Hambantota port** poses challenges for Indian maritime security.
- The killing of Indian ==fishermen by t==he Sri Lankan Navy; the confusion regarding the use of ==Katchatheevu island== and the use of bottom trawling by Indan fishermen.  
**Challenges posed by Pakistan for Indian internal security:**
 
![CILCIT BA TISTAN Pakistan Siachene Glacie AKSAI Ch...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607050855-7.jpeg)- ==State-sponsored terrorism in== Kashmir and hinterlands.
- Pakistan has been actively involved in ==drug trafficking,== especially in areas of Punjab through its presence in the **Golden Crescent.**
- Pakistan has also been running f==ake Indian currency notes== on a large scale, to earn the euphemism that" Pakistan is the only country that prints the currency notes of its neighbor more than it does of its own".
- The All-Weather friendship of Pakistan with China( ==higher than the Himalayas, deeper than seas, sweeter than honey==) is seen through the placement of Chinese troops in POK which is a disputed territory, Chinese veto on the designation of terrorists such as Masood Azhar, etc has been a point of much concern for India.
- The presence of Chinese in Gwadar port, POK is deeply concerning for India.  
**China:**  
 

![INDIA CHINAS SIRING OF PEARLS AND MARITIME SILK RO...](Obsidian-files/Media/Exported%20image%2020250607050857-8.png)- T==he== **String of Pearls** ==strategy is== to encircle India in the Indian Ocean region.
- ==Cyber warfare thr==ough attacks on various government websites and even on our infrastructural establishments like the power outage in Mumbai in January 2021.
- Chinese strategy of ==building dams over Tsang Po ( Brahmaputra) can c==ause serious issues for both India and Bangladesh.
- The dumping of cheap Chinese goods in the Indian market overwhelms the domestic manufacturing capability in India.
- Multiple ==border incursions, i==n Kashmir, Doklam, etc.
- Covert ==support to the insurgency in North East.==   
   

### **Terrorism**
 
- **According to the** **FB****I:** “Terrorism is the unlawful use o==f force or violence against persons or property to intimidate== or coerce a government, th==e civilian population, or an==y segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” - **Second ARC** defines  Terrorism as an ==anxiety-inspiring method of repeated violent action==, employed by (semi-) clandestine individuals, groups or state actors, ==for idiosyncratic, criminal, or political reasons, w==hereby the ==direct targets of violence are not the main targets.== 

The immediate human victims of violence are generally chosen randomly (targets of opportunity) or selectively (representative or symbolic targets) from a target population, and serve as message generators.
 
   
**India’s Resolution in UN against International Terrorism:**

- In 1996, India moved a Resolution in the UN by the name of the **Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (UN CCIT).**  
- The Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism is a proposed treaty that intends to criminalize all forms of international terrorism and deny terrorists, their financiers, and supporters access to funds, arms, and safe havens.
- It is still the only global effort to define terrorism. 
- USA wants to exclude operations done by the state in peacetime from CCIT.
- **OIC** members want to exclude the self-determination movement due to Kashmir, and Palestine.
- India has been talking about terrorism for a long, the west only recognized terrorism after the 9/11 attacks.
 
 **Hurdles to CCIT:**
 
**General instructions for Internal Security:**
 
- Terrorism is to be covered through the handouts. 
- Students must try to incorporate examples from current affairs.
- The questions will most probably be predictable, and students can utilize the time during the exam for other questions.
- Due to predictability, ==students can start the paper from the questions on internal security,== even if they are towards the end of the question paper.
