### **E-GOVERNANCE**
          
### Role of Civil Services in Democracy:
       
**Democracy and Bureaucracy (complementary and conflict)**
  - Complementary: 
    
    - The efficient delivery of services complements the goals of democracy.
    - The bureaucracy acts as the bridge between the citizenry and the government and understands the pulse of the citizenry.
    - The bureaucracy provides for an impartial setup and it is based on rule of law.
    - The bureaucracy must not centralize power and there must be decentralization.
    - Rigid structure gives rise to red-tapism.
    - They are not directly accountable to the people.
    - The elitist outlook of bureaucracy should change to a more sensitive, people-friendly, and responsive civil service.
 
**Civil Services neutrality:**

- It is to maintain absolute neutrality, irrespective of the political party in power.
- And it also ensures administration, that is, unbiased.
- Civil services neutrality promotes efficiency, work without fear and bias, and work for even those who did not vote for the party in power.
 
**Role of civil services post-LPG:**

- The Civil Services post-LPG has a different role because the government is retreating from loss-making sectors. 
- Civil services ensure that there is enough competition in the market.
- Promote skill development, and take care of the weaker sections of society. 
- Integration of the Indian economy with that of the global economy. 
- Accommodate the aspirations of civil society and make them partners in development.
- Promote ease of doing business.
- Post 73rd/74th Amendment, there should be democratic decentralization at the Grassroot level, and civil services should promote participative governance. 
- Promoting India’s interest abroad as diplomats and also ensuring the multinational corporations work in tandem with the domestic laws/rules, etc.
 
**All India Services:**

- As per ==Article 312==, All India Services are envisaged.
- There are three All India Services, namely, Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, and Indian Forest Services.
- A new All India Services is created by the Parliament after Rajya Sabha passes a resolution in that effect, by a majority of not less than ⅔ of the members present and voting.
 
**Benefits of All India Services:**

- To promote national integration.
- For promoting effective governance, uniform training, uniform pay scale, etc. is required.
- The All-India servants act as the bridge between centre and state.
- The cadre-based deputation system provides for the same officer at the state and the union levels. 
- The deputation provides opportunities to the civil servants from the ground level to participate in policy-making. 
- It promotes coordination between the civil servants at the state level and those posted at the union level. 
 
**Recap of previous class**

- The separation of the Judiciary and Executive in public services is mentioned in ==Article 50.==
- As per the CrPC, ==Judicial Magistrates== are the lowermost tier of the criminal Judiciary.
- It is every accused person's right to be produced before a Judicial Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest.
- Executive Magistrates, also called District Magistrates, are officers of the Executive, and hold administrative positions in the governance of the district.
 
**Difference between the Indian Penal Code** **(IPC) 1860** **and The Code of Criminal Procedure** **(CrPc) 1973:**

- IPC is the principal criminal code of India that defines crimes and provides punishments for almost all kinds of criminal and actionable wrongs.
- CrPC is the procedural law that provides a detailed procedure for punishments under penal laws.
- **For example:** If anyone is accused of murdering someone, he/she will be charged under ==section 302 of IPC==. He will be produced before the magistrate, his statement will be recorded, he will undergo cross-questioning, etc. as per CrPc.
   

**Generalist v/s Specialist debate:**

- Generalists work as specialists through generalized training.
- IAS, as generalists, tend to over-weigh their experience of the process and form an understanding of policy content.
- The debate gets starker when specialized departments like the Office of the CAG get headed by a  generalist, despite the existence of a specialized Indian Audit and Accounts Services.
 
**Issues with All-India Services:**

- It diminishes the character of Pan-India posting to the limits of the states concerned.
- This is because the All-India services officers mostly serve within their respective cadres, and states have thus a limited pool of officers to choose from.
- It at times leads to collusion with the local politicians.
- Many states are reluctant to release them for central deputation, and many times they are reluctant to go back to their parent cadre.
- It opposes any lateral entry.
 
**Reforms suggested by the second ARC:**
 
- Reduction in the age and attempts of applicants:  - The main reason behind this was to ensure that civil servants get to spend a longer career, which will do justice to the amount spent on them during training.
- The entire money spent on training is paid back to the Central government by the cadre states
- Specialized training at the national institute of public administration.
- Doing away with the optional subjects so that the playing field gets leveled.
- Objective and Subjective papers must be held together-prelims are being held since 1979 when the number of aspirants was felt too large for direct subjective exams.
- There should be an initial appointment for twenty years with two reviews in the 14th and 20th years.
- A comprehensive management system with new numerical ratings.
- Promotion should be based on merit and not only seniority.
- A comprehensive performance appraisal system.
- At the Secretary level, the positions must be open for All- India Services and Central Services and not only IAS.
- At least 13 years of domain experience in specialized positions.
- There must be a well-defined procedure for recruitment with wide publicity and open competition.

- The need for expert knowledge in the post-globalization world demands the services of domain experts.

- There is an ==element of subjectivity== in the process.
- The entrants may find it difficult to adjust to the bureaucratic structure.
- The wage gap between the private sector and the public sector is wide and this may induce them to corruption.
 
**Arguments in favor of lateral entry:**
 
**Arguments against lateral entry:**
 
**Way forward:**

- There should be ==transparency and objectivit==y in the recruitment procedure.
- The recommendation of the **second ARC** like ==lateral entry== at both union and state governments should be promoted and institutionalized.
- There should be the development of domain expertise in the already serving bureaucracy.
- The tenure can be increased.
- The lateral entry should be extended into the state governments with a more institutionalized process and be sector-specific.
