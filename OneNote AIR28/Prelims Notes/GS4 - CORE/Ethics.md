- Eg- Lal Bahadur Shastri
- IAS officers who have set examples in India (homework)
- IAS officer sending daughter to Aanganwadi
- Ghatpatila district in West Bengal- BDO: divided the kids into groups SCB, Rani Laxmi Bai,
- According to Warren Buffet while making the recruitment in the organization, to ensure efficiency we should look for intelligence, energy and integrity.
- However, if integrity is absent, the first two will kill us.”

**Values, Attitudes, Morals, Ethics (2.12 PM)**

- What are these concepts
- What are they made up of
- Characteristic features- Static vs Dynamic
- Absolute vs Relative
- Culture-specific vs universal
- Objective vs subjective
- What is their inter-relationship ?
- How do they develop?

**Socialization (2.18 PM)**

- VAME- Value, Action, Moral, Emotions
- These are mental constructs that act as an instrument of behavior regulation. They guide our decision making influence our choices, direct our behavior.
- These are made up of- cognitive/ belief
- Emotion/ affective
- Action/ behavior tendency
- Belief- that something is true. Beliefs can be unproven or irrational. They can be rooted in tradition, myth, verifiable facts, superstitions etc.
- These are the ideas, viewpoints which are held by a group or a society.
- Belief gives us hope.
- Human action thrives on beliefs.
- Beliefs can be challenged. However, peripheral beliefs can be changed.
- Core beliefs are long-lasting beliefs when seen in the light/ prism of desirability and undesirability.
- Beliefs generate emotions. Emotions are bodily arousal which is a reaction to an event either internal or external.
- Emotions are expressed through action and when expressed through appropriate action, it gives us a sense of relief.
- Emotions generate the desire for action. However, it does not result in an actual action as it needs to overcome certain impediments.

**Characteristic feature (VAME- is taken as one) (2.41 PM)**

-  Static vs dynamic- it is relatively permanent.  They are the source of our identity. They are the result of massive investment of time, cost and energy. However, there can be a variation if the environment changes drastically or the behavior to express the given value undergoes a change.
- Absolute vs relative-
- Absolute says values are constant and independent of the situation.
- However, relative says it is context-specific. There is nothing right or wrong for all time to come.
- Absoluteness is a tinge of rigidity whereas relativeness provides the flexibility which is needed to operate in the environment successfully.
- It depends upon the situation, timing, and choice of word.
- Culture-specific or universal (3.02 PM)
- Values are the adhesive that binds people of culture together.
- Societies to survive: Needs to be stable, harmonious, cohesive, one of the pre-requisite. Hence, some of the values are culture-specific.
- Eg- collectivism, strong religious orientation, familial obedience.
- However, there are certain values which transcend the boundaries of a different culture. Eg- love, happiness, honesty, compassion
- Objective vs subjective
- **Values** are objective it means it lies outside the individual and is not dependent upon their individual perception. Eg- Beauty.
- It has been quoted that “beauty lies in eyes of the beholder.”
- A certain school of thought believes values are subjective as individual differences occur wrt perception, understanding and judgment.
- **Morals-** they are considered as individual beliefs wrt right and wrong.
- **Ethics-** It refers to rules or standards which help in determining ethical conduct. It provides us the framework for understanding and interpreting what is right/ what is wrong.
- Value- general determinant of behavior.

**The topic for the next class: Socialization (to be continued…)**
 
# Ethics Class 02
 
**A breif review of the previous class and doubts**. (1:07 PM)

- Andre Beteille - Law determines the direction in which the  Society should move. However, it is the culture that determines the direction in which society actually moves
- Value, Morals, Attitude, etc and their interlinkages 
- Values are nothing but guiding principles, etc  

**Ethics and Morals**: (1:25 PM)

- **Parameters**:
- What are they 
- Source 
- Why do we tend to follow them 
- Objective/Subjective/Flexibility 
- Example 
- **Ethics**:
- What are they - It is the prescriptive rule of conduct ie what should be the right way in which a person should act in a situation 
- Source - external source or social system 
- Why do we tend to follow them - because society says it and is the right thing to do 
- What if we do not follow it - We might face societal disapproval 
- Objective/Subjective/Flexibility - Ethics are comparatively more objective as it is the collective proposition of the society 
- **Morals**:
- What are they - They are the standards that individuals set for themselves. It helps in guiding a person about the rightness or wrongness of an act 
- Source - Internal or individual 
- Why do we tend to follow them - Because we believe in something being right or wrong say
- What if we do not follow it - It will generate guilt, remorse, the crisis of conscience 
- Objective/Subjective/Flexibility - These are more subjective as it varies from individual to individual 

**Norms**: (1:40 PM)

- One of the sources of ethics is Norms 
- Norms are the social expectations that guide our behaviours 
- It is the set of rules or behaviour agreed upon by the societal members and is binding on all 
- Norms are a form of social control on individuals to ensure conformity, to induce uniformity and check deviant behaviour 
- They are expressed through customs, folklores, traditions, etc 
- Any non-conformity might lead to social ostracization 
- Examples of norms - visiting religious shrines, touching the feet of elders, marrying according to parent's wishes

**Ethics**: (1:51 PM)

- What is the right thing to do
- There are different sources to answer this 
- Hence fulfilling the need of having a common enforceable standard of behaviour led to the codification of norms ie Laws

**Laws and Ethics**: (1:54 PM)

- Laws are based on an ethical framework and aim to bring social order while controlling the unethical behaviour of individuals in the society 
- Laws act as an external standard and rules imposed on the individuals by the government 
- Any individual disobeying the laws is liable to face prescribed penalties and punishment. Hence, deter non-compliance 
- Laws have societal sanctions and have an important role in the smooth functioning of the society 
- Ethics act as the moral compass in guiding an individual when even law is silent on the action 
- Ethics act as the first line of defence against any wrong practices whereas law enforcement is remedial and reactive 
- For example:
- The role of an administrator where discretion has to be exercised
- A government may not frame laws to dictate whether a company should make its products environmentally safe but doing so is the ethical thing to do

**Examples**: 

- Legal but unethical - breaking promises, live-in-relationships, denying ration under PDS due to lack of Aadhar might be legal but when it leads to death due to starvation is unethical; Suicide; prostitution is legal in some countries but not ethical; passive euthanasia; inter-caste marriage, etc

- While playing such roles the individual is able to get a feel of other's emotions and values; accordingly, modify their response 
- **Trial and  error**: Learning from one's own experiences 

**Agency of Socialisation**: (2:53 PM)

- **Family:** It is an institution that fulfils the need for value consensus by socialising the children in their formative years by imparting societal values
- It helps children in conforming with the norms and roles  which are required for integration into the society 
- Family is an informal agency of socialization and family members are the immediate role models 
- It imparts the values of love, happiness, loyalty, honesty, sacrifice, etc 
- Over the period of time, the structure of the family has changed and so are the values 
- For example, with respect to (wrt) joint family, collectivism, co-operation, delayed gratification, reciprocal obligation, etc 
- However, wrt Nuclear family, individualism, independence, consumerism, achievement orientation, etc 
- **Style of Parenting:**
- Authoritarian parenting - They believe in restricting the autonomy of the children

# Ethics Class 03
 
**A brief review of the previous class**. (1:06 PM)  
**Education**: (1:15 PM) 

- Schools are the formal agency of socialisation which provides the medium where individuals learn to communicate with those who are neither kin nor friends 
- The child learns to co-operate accept differences and becomes adaptive 
- It acts as a bridge between family and society and prepared the child for their role in adulthood 
- It instils the values of equality, honesty, loyalty, brotherhood, tolerance, integrity, empathy, unconditional positive record, etc 
- Schools help us to develop cognitive skills, social skills, interpersonal skills, psychomotor skills, etc
- "Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all". - Aristotle. 
- **Role of teachers:**
- They are great role models and their actions leave a significant impact on the children in their impressionable age 
- The teachers through their personal attributes can shape the value system of any nation's future generation 
- For example, unbiased treatment of the class, commitment, diligence, timeliness promote the culture of learning developing curiosity, inquisitiveness, approachability, empathy, positive self-attribution,  
- **Role of curriculum**:
- Culture-specific inputs so that it facilitates child's adjustment in social milieu/set-up 
- For example, think Global and Act Local
- Mechanism of storytelling for better inculcation of values 
- Content should be driven by scientific temper without any ideological colouration 
- Outcome-based learning should be promoted 
- Instead of parochial/narrow evaluative standards, 360* assessment should be ensured (National Education Policy)
- Value-based education need to be promoted
- The discrepancy gap between text and context needs to be reduced  
- “Education without values, as useful as it is, seems to make the man a more clever devil”. - C.S Lewis
- Economic Growth potential generated due to increase in life expectancy
- Value-based education to promote national integration; respect for elders; Constructive resolution of conflict 
- It will enable us to differentiate between right and wrong, identify the pitfalls and potentials of scientific advances in the society 
- Help in developing emotional intelligence, etc 
- **Role of extracurricular activities:**
- Teamwork
- Leadership skills 
- Co-operation 
- Responsibility assumption  
- Achievement orientation 
- Confidence 
- Self-efficacy
- Accommodation of unity in diversity 
- Dynamic personality 

**Media**: (2:00 PM)

- Media acts as an agency of socialisation by providing the topics for discussion 
- By providing us with vicarious reinforcement
- By teaching us values and important lessons
- Shaping our attitude and opinions 
- Influencing our aspirations 
- Mass media can act as a tool for social management; social diffusion and social change 

**Peer Group:** (2:12 PM)

- Interaction among co-equals 
- Their ideas are more flexible 
- The range of topics taken for interaction is very wide 
- The importance of peer group is at its peak during adolescence
- Hence peer group association along with inputs from family and schools enables us to overcome the crisis 

**Religion**: (2:19 PM)

- It is defined as the unified system of beliefs and practices which binds people into one single moral community 
- It plays the role of an integrative social force and the rituals promote group solidarity and cohesion 
- It provides an individual with a sense of belongingness 
- It gives courage to people to manage misery 
- The role of religion as an agent of socialisation cannot be ignored 
- It is the primary transmitter of our core values 
- Values enshrined in our constitution are fundamental precepts of most religions for example equality, tolerance, brotherhood, justice, etc 
- Many leaders have called upon religious values to awaken the moral sensibilities of the nation 
- Hence, religion should not be viewed as a polarising force but a socialising force 
- Religion helps the individual to cope with the dysfunctional (negative) influences 

**Attitude**: (2:31 PM)

- Concept and Characteristic features 
- Components/Structure of attitude 
- Functions of Attitude 
- Attitude-Behaviour Consistency 
- Social Influence and Persuasion 

**Concept of attitude**: (2:38 PM)

- It is the readiness of the psyche to act or react in a certain way 
- It is about the positive and the negative evaluation of an object, idea, event, person, etc 
- They are the lasting evaluation of various aspects of our social world 

**Characteristic features**: (2:44 PM)

- They are enduring 
- Attitude is acquired or learned as a result of socialisation 
- Attitudes are held because they perform some functions for the attitude holder 
- Attitude may involve individuals or groups 
- They are evaluative judgements 
- Attitude is always communicated either verbally or non-verbally 
- Attitude confirms the principle of consistency 
- Attitudes are subjective experiences 
- Attitude involves subject and objects

**Components and structure of attitude**: (2:50 PM) - Mind Map/Flow Chart  
**Prejudice**: (3:02 PM)

- Prejudices are the example of negative attitudes towards a particular group 
- It is based on stereotypes and is frequently accompanied by dislike, anger, etc 
- Prejudice may also get translated into discrimination 
- History contains numerous examples of discrimination based on race, class, caste, etc 
- Genocide committed by Nazis in Germany against Jews 
- Our own society has witnessed many incidences of discrimination and prejudice based on gender, religion, age, caste, physical mental disabilities, etc 
- At the behavioural level, it can be curbed by law; for example, prevention of Atrocities Act; Person With Disability Act; Transgender Protection Act, etc 
- However, the cognitive and emotional components of prejudice are more difficult to change 
- Hence the following strategies can be adopted:
- Education and information dissemination for correcting the stereotypes 
- Increasing intergroup contact allows for removal for mistrust; direct communication and discovery of positive qualities of the outgroup 
- Highlighting individual identity rather than group identity will weaken the importance of group as a basis of evaluating the other person 
- Removal of prejudice at different levels of governance 
- Unbiased journalism 
- Discouraging the tendency towards negative behaviour among the victims of prejudice which in turn reinforces the prejudice 

**Topics for the next class**: Functions of Attitude, etc 
 
# Ethics Class 04
 
**A brief review of the previous class**. (5:10 PM)  
**Social Media - Impact on Social and Political Culture:**

- In today's time, there is so much presence of social media that it impacted every aspect of life for eg social and political culture 
- **Social Culture:**
- Positive impact:
- Awareness with respect to (wrt) social evils in the society 
- Leads to mobilisation and helps in the assertion and hence lead to social change 
- Accommodative culture and tolerance towards diversity 
- It would also lead to the strengthening of social capital
- Generate empathy and compassion towards the marginalised sections of society 
- It would create a platform for 3Ds ie debate, discussion and deliberation 
- With anonymity, it provides the aspect of questioning the regressive practices 
- Awareness and promoting of traditional values 
- Preservation and promotion of indigenous culture 
- The democratisation of social culture and Breaking of stereotypes 
- Negative impact:
- Hatred and intolerance 
- Radicalisation 
- Generating prejudices 
- Anonymity - diffusion of responsibility 
- Fake news - the exodus of communities 
- **Political Culture:**
- Positive Impact:
- Strengthening democracy 
- Accountability and responsibility will ensure good and smooth governance 
- Checks and balances - prevents hasty policy decisions 
- The legitimacy to the government 
- Mobilisation for a political cause eg Umbrella Movement (Hongkong)
- A platform for the pressure groups/interest groups 
- It will ensure representation to every section of the society 
- Provides voice to stakeholders 
- Negative Impact:
- Fake news/narrative 
- Propaganda 
- Technology in itself is value-neutral. It depends on what use it has been put to will determine whether it is positive or negative - Mohd Yunus 

**Bureaucratic Attitude and Democratic Attitude**: (5:31 PM)

- **Bureaucratic Attitude:**
- It defines the attitude of the Public servants to strictly follow the decision-making process according to written rules and guidelines 
- Some basic attributes of this attitude are - Objectivity, neutrality, top-down, rule orientation, secrecy, etc  
- Merits - Decision making based on SOPs hence no partiality, quick decision making, easy to fix responsibility and hold others accountable in case of any problem
- Demerits - Indifference to public opinion, apathy, resulting into alienation among public wrt process of governance; red-tapism, status quo, people are treated more like subject rather than stakeholders, corruption; it cripples the capacity pf the administrator to be innovative/creative; the crisis of conscience 
- **Democratic Attitude**:
- This attitude encourages people's participation in the decision-making process 
- Some basic attributes are compassion, empathy, participative, consultative, flexible, bottom-up 
- Merits - Good governance and free flow of ideas, target-based approach or piecemeal engineering approach; internalization and acceptance of policies by the public;  it helps in strengthening the rights-based approach 
- Demerits - Delay in decision making, difficulty in arriving at consensus; the problem of lack of informed participation (informed and active citizenry is necessary for efficient democracy)
- Overall, it should be the combination of two; for example, wrt to day-to-day decision making bureaucratic attitude can be used or wrt guidelines at the macro level bureaucratic attitude can be used
- However, when we have a large public interface  or ta the level of implementation democratic attitude is welcome 

**Functions of attitude**: (5:56 PM)

- **Daniel Katz's perspective****:**
- Need-based function 
- Knowledge Function 
- Ego-defensive function 
- Value-expressive function 
- **Need Satisfaction****:**
- Many attitudes are formed as a result of our past rewards and punishment for saying or doing things 
- Once formed these attitudes usually continue to be useful in helping us satisfy our needs or reach our goals (Utilitarian)
- The day it stops fulfilling our need, we will abandon the attitude and replace it with a new one 
- For eg, we have a positive attitude towards a political party that will serve our political ambitions/advance our economic development/serve our social interest  
- Attitude changes with the change in need or an individual are convinced that new attitude suggested to him can meet his existing needs better 
- Eg - to change attitude wrt reservation, we can make agriculture lucrative or promote entrepreneurship 
- **Knowledge Function:**
- Attitude helps attitude holders to organise and interpret a diverse set of information
- They provide consistency and clarity in our explanation and understanding of events 
- The knowledge function of the attitude does not imply that it is providing a factually correct information 
- In fact, it provides a picture that is meaningful to the individual who happens to hold this attitude 
- Such attitudes are likely to change when it becomes difficult to continue with the existing attitude 
- Hence, with the availability of counter-information, sustained availability will lead to internalisation of the information 

**Ego-Defensive Function of attitude**: (6:30 PM)

- We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of darkness and the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
- Attitude helps us to enhance our self-esteem, defend us against various arrows of life
- It protects us from acknowledging the basic truths about ourselves; it is a means to release frustration 
- These defences are more used by those who are insecure and anxious 
- Very difficult to change this attitude as it stems from personality inadequacies 
- Hence, the need of the hour is to provide an environment in which individual feels truly valued and ready to lower the defences 
- Such exploration will require the individual to experience empathy and unconditional positive regards 
- Eg - prejudiced attitude; grapes are sour; culture of blaming others; justifying your actions which can otherwise leave you embarrassed 

**Value Expression Function**: (6:45 PM)

- It helps a person to establish his identity and to convey both to himself as well as others what kind of person he is 
- It helps us in the exercise of impression management 
- It helps us communicate who we are and makes us feel good because we have asserted our identity
- Example - status on WhatsApp; quotation on t-shirts; wearing sweatshirts of educational institutions, etc 
- Let us suppose the core value of the individual is freedom, as a result, the individual encourages a flexible work schedule, the democratic decision in the organisation, freedom wrt dress code, etc 
- The change will occur if individual values have changed  or new attitudes will express the underlying values better 

**Attitude-Behaviour (a-b) Consistency**: (6:56 PM)

- Background and examples:
- X has a prejudiced attitude against a certain community. Hence being a landlord, X refused to give the house on rent (a-b Consistency)
- Lapierre Study - Attitude is not always consistent with the behaviour
- It was reflected in this study wrt racial attitude towards Chinese couples in America 
- The study by Corey - Cheating behaviour does not depend on attitude towards cheating but how poorly one has performed in the exam 
- **Factors affecting (a-b) consistency:**
- **Individual Factors:**
- High on self-monitoring - In the different situations with different people they act like  every different person 
- Their behaviour results from pragmatic concern about what is appropriate in each situation 
- Low on self-monitoring -  Their behaviour is usually an expression of their true feelings, attitude and beliefs 
- **Situational factors**:
- Attitude as a heuristic - When you have information overload; no time to plan or contemplate before the behaviour 
- Hence, whatever attitude you possess you will act accordingly
- For example, brand impact on behaviour; recruitment in an organisation;  
- Bandwagon effect - Suppose you have X attitude and others have Y Attitude and you hold other in high regards then there is very less probability of A-B Consistency, etc 

**Topics for the next class**: Continuation of attitude, etc 
 
# Ethics Class 05
 
**A brief overview of the class**. (5:05 PM)  
**Attitude Strength**: (5:08 PM)

- Attitude Relevance: The relevance of the attitude depends upon the vested interest of the individual with respect to the attitude object 
- The strength of the attitude is also determined by whether the individual has direct exposure to the attitude object 
- For example - the attitude of an individual towards a sport 
- How has the individual acquired the attitude - Attitude with respect to reservation, nepotism, etc
- Attitude specificity - Specific attitude is stronger than the general attitude
- For example, are you religious or how often do you visit religious shrines
- Attitude Accessibility - How quickly the attitude comes to our mind when we are exposed to the attitude object 

**Social Influence**: (5:30 PM)

- Background - Concept of Social Influence and Scholarly Perspective:
- Carl Hovland was recruited by US armed forces to bolster the morale of the soldiers to keep continuing their fight against Japan 
- Post World War II, social influence has become a significant field of study 
- Knowledge of social influence can help in changing people's attitudes, beliefs, actions, etc 
- For example, people following traffic rules can influence the behaviour of those who violate the rules 
- It is defined as a change in a person's behaviour, thoughts, attitude, due to interaction with other individuals in the society 
- According to French and Raven, social influence can be viewed as an outcome of an application of social power
- For example, reward, coercive, legitime, referent and expert 

**The mechanism through which Social influence is manifested:** (5:55 PM)

- **Conformity**:
- What is conformity - It is a type of social influence in which individuals change their attitude and behaviour so as to fall in line with the existing social norms 
- Why do people tend to conform:
- Normative social influence - Need to be liked by others whose acceptance we desire is referred to as normative social influence 
- Informational Social Influence - The more you are uncertain and lack expertise, the more you tend to go with the group 
- Self-categorisation - Ingroup and ingroupism - the struggle for power/prestige/resources - Group conflict 
- Attributional error - ingroup heterogeneity and outgroup homogeneity - Prejudice and violence 
- We have a desire to place ourselves in some or other category 
- Group membership facilitates this 
- We identify with our group to maintain our "self-concept"
- And more important is the membership of the group as a tool to promote our identity
- The stringer will be our affiliation and greater are the chances of ingroupism 
- Factors affecting conformity:
- The size of the group 
- Status of group 
- Unanimity among members 
- Immediacy 

**Compliance**: (6:31 PM)

- **What is compliance:**
- It is a form of social influence involving direct requests from one person to another 
- It is technically, changes in behaviour and not in attitude 
- Satisfaction is derived from compliance due to the social effect of accepting influence 
- **Principles of compliance**: Robert Cialdini:
- Liking and friendship - We comply with requests from friends or the people we like 
- Commitment and consistency - Once we have committed ourselves, we are more willing to comply with the request for the behaviour ie consistent with that position  
- Reciprocity - we comply with the request of someone, who has provided us with a favour 
- Scarcity - We try to secure opportunities that are scarce 
- Social validation - we comply with a request for action if the action is consistent with what we believe persons similar to ourselves are doing 
- Legitimacy/Authority - We show a willingness to comply with requests from someone who has a legitimate authority 
- **Techniques of compliance**:
- Foot in the door - You start with a small request and once it is granted, you escalate it to the larger one 
- Door in the face - Requesters begin with a large request but when it is refused, retreat to the smaller one (which was actually desired)
- That's not all - Requester offers additional benefits to target persons before they have decided to comply or reject the specific request 
- Small extra concessions increase the pressure to reciprocate 
- Deadline Technique - Target persons are told that they have only limited time to take advantage of some offer 
- Playing it hard to get - Increasing compliance by suggesting that the person or the object is scarce to obtain 

**Obedience**: (7:15 PM)

- **What is obedience:**
- It is a form of social influence in which the person obeys the direct orders from another person to perform some task or action 
- **Why do we obey**:
- Visible badges 
- Transfer of responsibility 
- The gradual escalation of authority figure's order 
- Proximity with an authority figure 
- **Destructive Obedience:** 
- Stanley Milgram's Experiment and Crowd-Mob Flowchart
- The subjects were asked to give the shock if the confederates make a mistake and with every subsequent error the intensity of shock will increase 
- The shocks were given in the range of 100-440 volt 
- The majority of psychologists believe they would not go to the extent of 440 volt
- However, more than 90% of the subjects did go to that extent 
- This is an example of destructive obedience 

**Topics for the next class**: Continuation of Persuasion, etc 
   

# Ethics Class 06
 
**A brief overview of the class**. (5:08 PM)  
**Persuasion**: 

- Concept and Aristotle's Perspective 
- Elements of Persuasion and steps involved in Persuasion 
- Barriers in the process of persuasion

**Concept of Persuasion:** (5:21 PM)

- The process of persuasion is aimed at changing the person's or group's attitude or behaviour towards some events, idea, object or another person by using written or spoken words to convey information, feeling or reasoning or a combination of them

**Aristotle's Perspective on Persuasion**: (5:31 PM)

- Ethos - the credibility of speakers 
- Pathos - appealing to emotions 
- Logis - logic+data+facts
- According to Aristotle, the following strategies can be used to bring about successful persuasion
- 1. Ethos:
- It is an appeal to ethics 
- To convince someone of the character, authority and credibility of the persuader
- It can be done in multiple ways; for example - By being a notable figure in the field demonstrating the mastery over the vocabulary of the field 
- Being introduced by some established authority 
- 2. Logos:
- It refers to the logical appeal ie to site facts and statistics

- Logos can be developed by constructing logical arguments, drawing historical analogies and citing facts 
- 3. Pathos:
- Making an appeal to emotions ie convincing the audience by creating an emotional response ie trying to invoke sympathy 
- Pathos is most effective when the author or speaker has the same value set as that of the listener 
- Pathos can be developed by using meaningful language, emotional tone, emotion-evoking examples

**Elements of Persuasion**: (5:44 PM)

- **Who** said **what** to **whom** by **what** means 
- Who - source; What - message; whom - receiver; what means - channel factor

**Steps involved in Persuasion**: (5:46 PM)

- **A**ttention - interesting, utility, distinct, generating curiosity 
- **C**omprehension - It refers to the ability of the source to make the target group understand the message; hence it is important to take into cognisance the target's group frame of reference 
- **R**etention - The target group should be able to retain and retrieve the message presented and for this, the message should be presented repeatedly and we need to highlight the salient points in the message 
- **A**cceptance and **A**ction - Persuasion is said to be successful if the target group not only receives the message but also acts upon it in a manner intended by the source 
- Source to the target group - Barriers such as sematic, psychological and physical can exist 
- Persuasion is a receiver centric exercise and hence necessary to overcome the barrier 
- Sematic Barriers:
- Sematic refers to the science of meaning and the barriers occur due to the following reason:
- 1. The words or sy=mbols can have more than one meaning 
- 2. Due to foreign or technical words in the message 
- 3. The barriers can also arise due to discrepancies in the verbal and non-verbal aspects of the message 
- The barriers can be overcome:
- 1. By using symbols that are receiver friendly 
- 2. By making communication idea centric rather than word centric 
- 3. Using illustrations and relevant examples to support the message 
- Psychological Barriers:
- It arises because of incompatibility between the attitude and value system of the source and the target group 
- It can also be due to emotional separateness between the two or due to power distance 
- The psychological barrier is the result of personality inadequacies of both source and receiver 
- To overcome this barrier there is a need to build a climate of trust and understanding 
- Physical Barrier:
- It arises due to disturbances in the physical environment that obstruct the flow of communication 

**Elements of Persuasion:** (6:15 PM)

- Source: credibility (conformity); attractiveness (identification - physical, communication, attitudinal); power (compliance)
- **Credibility**: It refers to the degree to which the target group believe in the position advocated by the source 
- Assess the credibility - is judged by whether the source is informed or not, whether there exists consistency in past behaviour or not 
- Trustworthiness and expertise go hand in hand; however, in case of conflict trustworthiness has an upper hand 
- Concept of sleeper effect - Low and high credible source - gap exists 
- Reinforce the credibility - development, good governance, social media, walking the talk, leading from the front, etc 
- **Attractiveness**: 
- An attractive source is perceived as more likeable and therefore the target group members are more receptive to the counter attitudinal message issued by the source 
- **Power**:
- It is the potential to influence, the behaviour of the target group in the intended direction and the greater the power of the source, the greater the probability of the successful persuasion 

**Message**: (6:37 PM)

- Message Discrepancy:
- Zone of acceptance, Zone of indifference and Zone of rejection 
- Facilitator, fencesitter and resistor 
- The facilitator is one who is warm/kind, empathetic, flexible, open-minded, a good listener, etc 
- To choose a credible, attractive and powerful source 
- Present the message in a culturally congruent manner 
- Make it interesting and utilitarian 
- Ensure their participation in the internalisation of the message
- **Fear Appeal**:
- Mild appeals to fear generally work better than strong appeals since strong appeals produce the defensive mechanism where the target group insulate themselves from the messages issued by the source
- Fear appeals are effective if they provide specific recommendations about how the change in attitude or behaviour would prevent the negative consequences described in the fear evoking messages
- **Drawing Conclusion**:
- Message is unstructured
- Message not related to core values
- The receiver is uninformed on the issue
- Not very educated/aware
- Do not consider "drawing conclusion" as an insult to their intellect
- Do to have any hostility between source and receiver
- **Sideness of the message**:
- One-sided message
- The target group is intelligent
- Not are of another side
- Already agreeing to your persuasive message
- Pros/Cons:
- The target group is intelligent
- The target group is already informed about the other side of the message
- It holds a counter-attitudinal approach
- It is having apprehensions about the intent of the source
- **Emotional and Factual Appeal:** Emotion + Factual \>\> Emotional \>\> Factual \>\> Neither Emotional/factual
- **Channel factor**: It is dependent upon both the nature of the message and the frame of reference of the target
- **A pleasant form of distraction**:  It positively reinforces the effectiveness of the persuasive appeal. It can be a form of food and humour 

**Receiver**: (7:10 PM)

- Many times the target group do not selectively intentionally avoid information but because of the culture in which they live 
- They get exposed to that information happens to support their existing viewpoint 
- Even when the persuaded is able to overcome the cultural barrier and reach the target group, there is a problem of selective attention and interpretation, etc

**The class started at 1:03 PM**  
**A brief review of the last class.**  
**Integrity (1:05 PM)-**

- Often honesty and integrity are considered synonymous with each other but there is a basic difference between the two values.

- It is an external concept and does not guarantee adherence to the highest standard of behaviour.
- On the other hand, integrity is the mother of all refers and refers to steadfast adherence to values and principles so as to result in the highest standard of behaviour and consistency in one's action, thoughts and behaviour irrespective of time, place and circumstances.

- **Selflessness**- Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of public interest.
- They should not do so in order to gain financial and other material benefits for themselves their family or friends.
- **Integrity** - NOLAN committee has defined integrity in a narrow sense as holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.
