**_Madhav Agarwal and Ratnesh Agrawal_** _— two friends, one mission, and a bond forged through shared dreams. From school classrooms to college corridors, their journey was always side by side. United by a common goal of cracking the UPSC, they spent over 300 hours on video calls — dissecting concepts, solving doubts, and building the notes that would become the backbone of their preparation._

_Madhav went on to secure AIR 211 in CSE-2023 and then soared to_ **_AIR 16 in CSE-2024_**_. Now set to join the_ **_Indian Administrative Service_**_, he is living proof that quiet determination, when sustained with laser focus, can turn even the toughest dreams into destiny._

_Ratnesh, who reached the_ **_UPSC interview stage in CSE-2023_**_, chose a different but equally powerful path. With the same intensity and sharp thinking that marked his preparation, he stepped into the world of real estate. Today, he’s a_ **_dynamic builder in Indore_** _— shaping skylines and lives with a vision rooted in public purpose and entrepreneurial fire._

_These notes are a result of their shared struggle, deep friendship, and uncompromising pursuit of excellence — a_ **_gift to future aspirants_**_, from two dreamers who refused to settle for average, each leaving a mark in his own way._

10. 2021: Q9. Examine the uniqueness of tribal knowledge system when compared with mainstream knowledge and cultural systems. (Answer in 150 words) 10

1. Tribal knowledge systems represent **inter-generational wisdom in band societies** passed on to the present times through **centuries of experience and learnings.** While similar characteristics can be seen in evolution of mainstream knowledge and culture, **tribal knowledge systems are unique due to following reasons:**
    1. Tribal societies have **contemporary knowledge of nature** due to continued closeness to forests, flora and fauna. **Mainstream societies** have moved on to **agricultural** basis of society, and their cultural knowledge represents **impressions of their tribal past, which no longer exists.**
    2. While **mainstream knowledge systems** are based on **rigorous refining and questioning** of ideas through discussions and scientific verification, **tribal methods** are based on **conservation of knowledge**. For example, the awareness among **tribals of Andaman & Nicobar** about a wall of sea helped them against **Tsunami in 2004.**
    3. Tribal knowledge systems are stored in **songs and stories,** while mainstream knowledge is preserved in **books and recordings.**
    4. Tribal knowledge systems promote **integrated learning** for the community. **In mainstream** society, knowledge and traditions have bifurcated, with **traditions becoming a subject of study instead of mode of studying.**
    5. Tribal knowledge systems are **non-exclusionary** and **marked by equity.** Mainstreams knowledge systems are mired in barriers like **cost of education, patent protections, social exclusion etc.**
2. Tribal and mainstream societies are **not mutually exclusive systems**. Constant interaction and mutual dependence have enriched both. The way forward should be based on mixture of **mutual learning and preservation** through **salad bowl model instead of assimilation.** Recent initiatives like India’s **Traditional Knowledge Digital Library** initiative or the Nehruvian model of **Tribal Panchsheel** are some other approaches.

- Alakappa, Kapilvastu, Kushinagar, Pava, Vaishali, Rajgriha, etc)

- - - In the next stage, relics of Buddhas disciples and companions were similarly enshrined. During 200 BCE to 300 CE, Stupas- with or without relics became important part of Buddhist monasteries.
        - The Stupa represented many things in the Buddhist tradition:
            - It stood for the axis mundi (the centre of the universe),believed to be the living presence of the Buddha, a depository of his protective powers and living energy.
        - The Stupa art expounding Buddhist ideals by using folk motifs and narratives:
            - The narrative art of Bharhut and Sanchi Stupa, depicting Jatakas of Buddha's previous birth in sculptures
            - **Sculputure -** Depicted Buddha as **empty seat, Manushi Buddha**, **dharma chakra for sermon**
            - The scene of the birth of Buddha in some Stupas shows Mother Maya flanked by two elephants (Gaja-Lakshmi motif)
            - Anda: symbol of latent creative power representing the cycle of death and rebirth. Anda relates to the universe in sometimes called the Garbha or 'womb'.
            - Harmika: located at the summit of the anda, symbolized the zenith beyond life and death (nirvana)
            - Yasti: Rising from the harmika was the yasti or pole (that was imagined to run through the anda into the ground) which represented the axis-mundi (world axis or centre of universe) that connected heaven and earth.
            - Chattras: Above the anda, the yasti serves as a support for chattras (umbrellas) that signify the supremacy of the whole structure. Symbolised the tri-ratna of Buddhism (in diagram below)
            - **Vedika:** Keeping with the ancient tradition of enclosing a sacred tree with a fence, the chattra was enclosed by a **railing or vedika**. The lowest _vedika_ had four entrance gateways or toranas. The orientation of the toranas (east, south, west and north) corresponded with the direction of the sun's course: to sunrise, zenith, sunset and nadir.
            - Ayaka Pillars: Five Ayaka pillars symbolically represents the five main events in Buddha s life viz., the birth, the great renunciation, the enlightenment, the first sermon and the final extinction.
            - ![GS1 Art Culture](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 9.jpeg>)#diagram
        - Hence, the early Buddhist Stupa art and architecture, though religious in character assimilated the secular folk motifs and narratives for

expounding the Buddhist ideals.

##### Reasons why Buddhism/Jainism came

- 1. The **Vedic rituals were expensive, sacrifices** - complicated and meaningless. It confused the people
    2. The rigid caste system prevalent in India generated tensions in the society. (**Kshatriyas had resented the domination of the priestly class**. **Both Buddha and Mahavira belonged to Kshatriya caste**)

##### The teachings of Upanishads- highly philosophical- not understood

by all

- 1. The growth of trade - **improvement in the economic conditions of the Vaishyas**- wanted to enhance their social status but the orthodox Varna system did not allow this- began to extend support to Buddhism and Jainism

##### Causes for the decline of Buddhism

- 1. The Buddhists **began to adopt Sanskrit**, the language of the elite. So

##### masses moved away

- 1. After the birth of **Mahayana Buddhism**, the **practice of idol worship**

and making offerings led to the **deterioration of moral standards**

- 1. The revival of Brahmanism and the **rise of Bhagavatism**. In **8th century AD, Adi Sankara** greatly cleaned up Hinduism and brought a very forward outlook. His efforts were assisted by other south Indian gems like Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, etc.
    2. **Rajput rulers were warlike and could not follow the policy of Ahimsa**. Besides, the Kings of the Gupta period patronised temples in honour of Hindu gods and goddesses. Thus, the **lack of royal patronage**brought about the decline of Buddhism.
    3. Moreover, the **attack of the Huns** in 5th and 6th centuries and the Turkish invaders in 12th century **destroyed** the **monasteries**.
    4. **Buddhism was mainly an urban religion** with the rural India always Hindu. When **Islam came to India**, it impacted the urban regions first and thus **Buddhism became the first victim**.

##### Contribution of Buddhism

- 1. The **concept of ahimsa was its chief contribution**. Later, it became one of the cherished values of our nation.
    2. It had also promoted the spread of Indian culture to other parts of Asia.
    3. **Religious revolution**- **Simplicity of his teaching** of truth connected with masses Explanation of sufferings through **4 Simple noble truths (v/s Three Jewels in Jainism)** and the the wheel of dhamma was **understandable by ordinary people unlike the scriptures** interpreted by priests only.
        1. Focus was on ethical living rather than rituals, animal sacrifices, etc. Authority of Vedas was challenged. Faith was given rational basis.
        2. It preached atheism that is, there is no God that will help us in Moksha but we ourselves are the makers of our destiny.
        3. **Buddhism does not focus on gods or deities** - While some Buddhist traditions incorporate deities, they are not central to achieving liberation
    4. **Social revolution**- It **opposed Caste and Varna system**, any form of hierarchy and discrimination
        1. Women were given equal status as men which was against the Shastras like Manusmriti (social code).
        2. Use of **Pali language** as opposed to Sanskrit which could be read only by Priests, **broke the monopoly over knowledge**.
        3. Emphasis on ahimsa, avoidance of extremes led to establishment of peaceful society.
        4. Tried to **narrow gap** between rich and poor by advocating its followers **not to accumulate wealth**.
    5. Its **contribution to the art and architecture** of India.- The **stupas** at Sanchi, Bharhut and Gaya, chaityas and viharas in different parts of India.
    6. It promoted **education through residential universities** like those at Taxila, Nalanda and Vikramasila.
    7. Economic- Vedic practice of killing cattle indiscriminately in sacrifices stood in progress of new agriculture.
        1. ![GS1 Art Culture](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 10.jpeg>)**Dharmasutras forbade money lending** on interest which was widely practised by **Vaishyas**

##### Ashoka’s Contribution in spread of Buddhism

1. Cultural Contribution: Ashoka sent Mahendra, Buddhist monks and missionaries on expedition to countries like Sri Lanka, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, China, Japan etc. Along with teachings of Buddha, they have made critical contribution to unfurl Buddhist festivals, cuisine, societal values etc. and specifically concept of nirvana.
2. Architectural contribution: Ashoka built stupas (best ex- sanchi and 9

stupas-AKPVR), viharas, chaityas, pillars, capitals and also expand the process of inscription writing on rock edicts. eg: **Bodh Gaya Temple was started by Ashoka**

- 1. Alakappa, Kapilvastu, Kushinagar, Pava, Vaishali, Rajgriha, etc

1. Musical Contribution: Musical chanting most often in Sanskrit and Tibet (now Intnagible Heritage) are integral part of Buddhism. Buddhist music prominently includes Honkyoku, Buddhist chant.
2. Ashoka **used local languages** and scripts (**Pali**) on inscriptions to make them easily understandable for common man and for cultural contact.
3. Helped to develop Mahaviharas such as Taxila.

##### Dhamma Gosh rather than Beri Ghosa Others contributors to Buddhism

1. Post Mauryan- **Menander** (**Milinda**)- Bactrian Greek who invaded India- patronised Buddhism, dialogue with Nagasena
2. **Kushans**- Kanishka- embraced Buddhism- **Mahayana Buddhism** came during his time (during 4th council by him), patronised Ashvaghosa (author of Buddhacharita), Gandhara 3 Mathura imp cities of art during his time
3. Gupta- **Kumaragupta- founder of Nalanda university +** Bagh buddhist paintings
4. **Harsha**- erected stupas and monastries (one at Nalanda) all over his kingdom, **Kanuaj assembly** to honour Huien Tsang, **patronised Nalanda** uni by donation- int reputation during his reign
5. **Foreign rulers- Sailendra rulers** of Indonesia- **Borobudr** monument at Java- most wonderful B stupa in world

##### Mauryan art and architecture (Caves, Pillars, Rock Edicts, Stupas)

1. Before Ashoka the tradition largely consisted of working in wood and clay. India has the brick ruins of Mohenjodaro. Buildings of Vedic and Buddhist era were of wood. Before Ashoka wooden pillars were regularly erected.
2. Ashoka is known to have built 84,000 stupas to commemorate various events of Buddha’s life. Sanchi stupa best example. According to Megasthenes, Pataliputra’s grandeur matched that of the cities of Persia
3. Ashokan edicts were **inscribed on stone pillars** that were made of single columns of polished **sandstone** and **had capitals on their top**. The best preserved of all Ashokan edicts stands at Champaran Bihar. The most famous capital is the one at **Sarnath, which shows four lions** and the Dharmachakra; **Rampurva had Bull**
4. Besides pillars- **Yakshi from Didarganj**. The beauty of these figures lies in the exactness of their workmanship
5. Rock cut caves: The **Lomash Rishi and the Sudama** caves - These caves cut from solid rock were provided **by Ashoka for Ajivika sect**. These caves **marked the beginning of the rock cut architecture** which was patronised by later rulers too.
6. His stone and **rock cut edicts** (14 major and other minor, **No.13- war with kalinga)** inscribed in Pali, Prakrit and in Kharoshti and Brahmi script. eg: **Sohagura Copper** Inscription, **Stone potrait at Kanaganahalli.**

##### Emperor Ashoka, who ruled the Mauryan Empire from 268 to 232 BCE -

##### Changes after Kalinga War

- 1. Referred to as **Piyadasi**
    2. Admin side: Decentralisation and local governance promoted; Dhamma Pillars & edicts made; Promotion of public welfare - roads, rest houses, hospitals, and wells
    3. Military Strength: Reduced aggression; Reorganised military (military exp to dev of infra); **Strategic defensive posture (for defence from external threats); Disciplined army (**tribals were disciplined, **war for dhamma);**
- Economic and social conditions during Mauryan period
    - **Royal incentives for industries**. Industrial arts and crafts proliferated as a result of swift communication through a network of goods and long roads.
    - **Employment of slaves** in agricultural operations.
    - **Formation of Shrenis and guilds**. They provided training, raw materials, and distributed product to merchants. They were provided with high autonomy because of their high importance in urban economy.
- Achaemenid (Persia) rule and influence
    - Administrative structure of the Mauryan empire was influenced in some measure by that of the Achaemenid rulers of Persia. The cultural effects of the contacts with the Persians were also significant. The Persian influence may also be traced in the preamble of Ashokan edicts.
    - The Persian scribes brought into India a new style of writing called kharosthi. It was derived from the Aramaic script, which was written from right to left. Many of Ashoka’s inscriptions found in north western India are written in kharosthi.
    - The Mauryan art and architecture were also greatly influenced by the Persian art. The monolithic pillar edicts of Asoka are somewhat like the victory pillars of the Achaemenid empire.

##### Archimedean (aka Persia) vs Asokhan pillars

1. The shaft of Asokan pillars is monolithic whereas the Archimedean pillars have joints.
2. Asokan pillars are erected without any support base whereas **Archimedean pillars have a support base**.
3. The **bell shaped part of Asokan pillars is at top** while that in **Archimedean pillars is at bottom**. However bell shaped part of Asokan pillars is an inverted lotus.
    1. #diagram
    2. ![GS1 Art Culture](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 11.jpeg>)
4. The **Asokan pillars were not a part of any other structure**. The purpose behind their construction was to engrave instructions. But **Archimidean pillars** were part of the **palace** and their job was to **support** the roof.
5. The Asokan pillars have capitals which have sculptures of lions, elephants and bulls. But the **Archimidean pillars have no capitals** and only images of humans are engraved on their shafts.

Alexander(Macedonian/Greek) and his influence - **Indo-Greek Art & Architecture has its origin in Alexander Invasion**

1. Achaemenid empire was finally destroyed by the Greeks under Alexander. Alexander came to North west India and did not come beyond it because his soldiers feared armies of Nanda’s of Magadha. Though the contact between the Macedonians (Greek) and ancient Indians was for a brief period, its impact was fairly wide in range.
2. Alexander’s invasion brought Europe in close contact with India, as sea and land routes were opened between India and the West. A close commercial relation was also established. The traders and craftsmen used to follow these routes.
3. Alexander’s invasion paved the way for political unification of north western India by conquering the warring tribes of this region.
4. The influence of Greek art is found in the Gandhara School of art.

##### Indians also learnt the art of making gold and silver coins from the Greeks.

1. Many ideas and notions of Indian philosophy and religion which filtered into the Roman empire flowed through the channel opened by Alexander.
2. Much valuable information about the social and economic condition of north western India can be known from Greek accounts left by Megasthenes. Ex: Crafts were developed, trade with outside world.

##### Caves

##### Evolution of Buddhist Cave Architecture

- 1. Phase-1: It **began with the construction of Lomas rishi and Sudama caves in Barabar hills by Ashoka**. These were simple caves.
    2. Phase-2: The **second stage (100 BC) showed up at Kondivite**- contained a stupa and a circumambulatory path around it (**Quadrangular Flat Roof**)
    3. Phase-3: The next stage was when **rows of pillars were built parallel to the walls** creating a circumbulatory passage right after entering eg:

**Kalra, Ajanta, Bhaja,** Pitalkhora

- 1. Phase-4: **During the Satavahana time, caves got royal patronage** and became more elaborate and ornamented. Multi-storied caves came up- **Triple storied vihara at Ellora**. Other examples are **Nasik caves, Kanheri caves**.
    2. #diagram
    3. ![GS1 Art Culture](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 12.jpeg>)

1. Jaina Caves vs Buddhist Caves:
    1. Jaina caves were cut in sandstone which is easy to cut but not good for sculpting. But Buddhist caves were cut into hard rocks and were better for sculpting.
    2. The Jaina caves had no congregation halls or rock cut shrines. The Buddhist caves on the other hand had clear halls and the shrine area.
    3. The **Jaina caves were simple and reflected the asceticism of Jaina monks**. The **Buddhist caves** on the other hand were an elaborate and **spacious affair.**
    4. In terms of similarities, the sculptures use similar motifs like animals, plants. Examples of Jain caves are **Khandgiri and Udaigiri** in Orissa,

##### Mangi Tungi Caves of MH

##### Types of Jain Architecture:

- - 1. **Caves** (covered above): Ellora, Sittanavasal Cave
        2. **Statues: Bahubali Statue**- Shravanabelagola, **Statue of Ahimsa (Rishabnatha)- Mangi-Tungi Hills**
        3. **Jianalaya (Temple): Dilwara** Temple- Mount Abu, Rajasthan;

**Girnar Temple**- **Gujarat**; Ghantai temple of Khajurao

- - 1. Jaina stupa is also found in Mathura which is called Devanirmit Stupa.
    
    1. The ascetic nature of these religions inclined their followers to live in natural caves and grottos in the hillsides, away from the cities.

##### Shunga Dynasty:

Began from circa 185–73 BCE

Decline of the Mauryan Empire led to the rise of regional powers, including the Shunga dynasty

Revival of Brahmanism; Hindu Iconography (deities and motifs); Influence of Buddhism remained (elaborated stupas with Buddha’s narrative reliefs); Architecture (Shunga stupas eg: Sanchi had carved toranas, built prayer halls chaityas and dwellings viharas); **Used location material and techniques** for diversity (**See how generic content is written**)

##### Stupas

1. The stupa originated as a simple semi circular mound of earth, later called anda. Gradually, it evolved into a more complex structure, balancing round and square shapes.
2. Above the anda was the harmika, a balcony like structure that represented the abode of the gods. Arising from the harmika was a mast called the yashti, often surmounted by a chhatri or umbrella. Around the mound was a railing, separating the sacred space from the secular world.
3. The **early stupas at Sanchi and Bharhut were plain except for the stone railings, gateways**-which were richly carved and installed at the four cardinal points; **Yasti had 3 rings**
4. The **new stupas had a 2 circumambulatory path** with stone railing, **two staircases leading** up to it, toran dwars on all four sides. Sculpture decoration

was found on the railings and the gateways. Examples are the stupas at

**Sanchi-II,** Nagarjunkonda, **Amravati**, etc.; **Yasti had 5/7 rings**

- 1. #diagram

1. ![GS1 Art Culture](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS1 Art Culture 13.jpeg>)
2. Dharmachakra at centre of stupa resembles Buddha’s first sermon
3. In AP stupas- 5 free standing pillars were erected. These represent the 5 important events in Buddha’s life birth, renunciation, enlightenment, first sermon, death
    1. Why did Sanchi survive while Amaravati did not- Amaravati was discovered before scholars understood the value of the finds. In British times- practice of collecting ancient sculptures ex-situ by removing them from archaeological sites like Amaravati. Request of Europeans to take away the eastern Gateway of Sanchi was refused by Shah-jehan Begum. She even provided money for preservation. No such ruler existed for Amaravati.
4. The **Ajanta caves in Maharashtra, a World Heritage Site**, are **30 rock- cut cave Buddhist temples** carved into the sheer vertical side of a gorge near a waterfall fed pool located in the hills of the Sahyadri mountains. Like all the locations of Buddhist caves, this one is located near main trade routes and spans six centuries beginning in the 2nd or 1st century BC.

##### Satavahanas

1. They were successors of the Mauryas in Deccan and the Central India.Most important king was Gautami Putra Satakarni (AD 106-130) who raised the power and prestige of Satavahanas to great heights.

##### Issued lead coins.

Social conditions during Satavahana time

1. The Satavahana society was divided into four classes. This division was based on economic activity and status. **Women were honoured**. They were given higher education and they took part in religious functions. Some of the rulers even **added their mother’s name** to their own name, such as Gautamiputra Satakarni
2. The Satavahanas were Brahmanas. Therefore, **Brahmansnism made rapid strides** under their rule. The Brahmanas were accorded the highest place. Effort was also made to revive the Varna system.

##### However they also constructed Buddhist Chaitya and Viharas eg: Sanchi II + Amravati is other type - where only panel sculpture - by Satvahanas & Ikshvaku

1. Inter marriages among the Hindus and foreign tribes of the Sakas, the parthians and the Greeks were freely consummated so that these foreigners were absorbed forever in the Hindu social order.

##### Gandhara school of Art

- - Around Peshavar during 1st-2nd C AD
    - It is between the 2nd and 5th century CE that Gandhara Art and the Art of Mathura came into existence as their separate identity. While the early Buddhist artists used symbols to represent the presence of the Buddha, **beginning with the Kushana rule, the Buddha was represented in human form**. Both Gandhara and Mathura Art schools reached their peak during Kanishka
    - **Originated during Indo-Greek (Bactrian) rulers but real patron were Kushanas (**Mathura and Gandhara **both** by Kushana) esp Kanishka
    - Blend of Indian and Greco-Roman elements
    - Kanishka made stupas in Greco-roman architectural style- many ruins **found in Peshawar, Rawalpindi**
    - Features of Gandhara Art: Spiritual Buddha Sad Buddha Bearded Buddha Less ornamentation Great detailing Buddha in Yogi postures Greek factors like wavy hair, large forehead, long ears; Grey sandstone
        - Moulding human body in realstic manner with minute attention to physical features like Moustache,muscles, curly hair
        - Thick drapery with large and bold lines
        - less carving, less ornamentation and symbolic expressions.
        - Played major role in evolution of Buddha image in Mahayana Buddhism
    - 2019: Highlight the Central Asian and Greco-Bactrian elements in Gandara art; 2014- Gandhara sculpture owed as much to Romans as to the Greeks. Explain
        - Gandhara called Greco-Buddhist Art- in areas of Afg, NW- closely associated with Mahayana B
        - Map: Bactrian, Indo Greek in NW India; Then became Greco-Bactrian →

How it came to India? Invasion of Alexander during Nandas

- - - **Region on crossroads** many cultural influnces as in the vicinity of

##### ancient silk route

- - - Patronised by Kushana ruler
        - Central asian elements
            - **Disc shaped halo** around Buddha similar to persian culture of

##### reverence of sun

- - - - **Kharosti script** on Buddhist inscriptions
            - Long overcoats, Sword & scabbard (not in Roman)
            - Figures with **conical and pointed caps** on their heads resemble the Scythian caps of similar design
            - The regular depiction of fire worship in the Gandhara art, a trait which was probably derived from Iranian sources
        - Greco-Bactrian elements
            - **Wavy hair, moustche**, **third eye/dot** btw eyebrows, symbolic expression such as of calmness
            - Grace and sharp physical attributes were inspired from Greek gods such as Apollo, Zeus
            - Muscular formation of body on lines of Hercules and Atlas
        - Roman elements (majorly influeced by greek but roman impact on gandhara quite noticiable)
            - Large forehead, large earlobe, broad chest & shoulders similar to gladiators, Tall sculptures
            - Standing buddha similar to roman emperor statues
            - The Gandhara school drew upon the anthropomorphic traditions of Roman religion and represented the Buddha with a youthful Apollo-like face, dressed in garments resembling those seen on Roman imperial statues. Its significance lies in the fact that until then Buddha was not represented in a human-like figure.
                - History- (Greece ruled under Roman empire)

##### Mathura school of art

1. Mathura (imp city under Kanishka) School of art (1st C AD) developed during post Maurya period and reached its peak during the Guptas It is known for its assimilative and indigenous character and is known for earliest Indian representations of the Buddha.
2. In its **early phase, Buddha was depicted as symbol of either two footprints or wheel. Later**, Buddha images represented in human form.
3. In **Mathura, more stress** is given to the inner beauty and **facial emotions** rather than bodily gesture or realistic human body representation. The **halo around the head of Buddha was profusely decorated** unlike the Gandhara Art form.
    1. **Cheat code:** Gandhara art has **spiritual image** (wavy hair, unshaven face, half closed eyes, veins & muscles visible) whereas Mathura art **has delighted image** (extensive clothes, round body, ornamentation; red sandstone)

##### Halo is used in Gandhara unlike Mathura (from Iranian Influence); Depicted here as god/divine vs more as a king in Mathura

1. Also, since the development of Mathura art took place indigenously, wherein it used locally available spotted red sandstone and Buddha images were modelled on the lines of earlier Yaksha images, **Also images of Shivlingas, Parvati, Vishnu with Ayudh, Yakshinis, Jain tirthankars were made (so not just Buddhist)**
2. Mathura during the Kushana rule, came under the influence of Gandhara School. With the increased demand of Gandhara Buddha, some Mathura sculptures too incorporated many Hellenistic (relating to Greek history) elements Ex: Sarvatobhadrika image of 4 Jaina’s standing back to back, **Standing Buddhas of the Sarnath** and Kausambhi.
    1. The first Mathura image makers never intended to sculpt an anatomically correct human Buddha. Later, the human Buddha images evolved
3. Thus, Mathura and Gandhara art cross fertilised, and the bulky Mathura Buddha gradually gave way to the slender elegance of the Gandhara image. The result of this synthesis refined and purified the Buddha image that appeared in the Gupta period, which later became the model for Southeast Asian Buddha images

##### Mathura vs Sarnath vs Amravati School of art

1. In north India, Mathura, remained the main art production site whereas Sarnath and Kosambi also emerged as important centres of art production.
2. Amravati is other type - where **only panel sculpture** - by **Satvahanas & Ikshvaku**
3. Buddha images in Sarnath have-transparent drapery covering both shoulders, and the halo around the head has very little ornamentation whereas the

Mathura images continue to depict folds of the drapery in the Buddha images and the halo around the head is profusely decorated

- 1. Below is **Sarnath Style - Mixture of Amravati and Mathura style** - Pink colour buff stone

##### Gupta Age

The Gupta period witnessed a tremendous progress in the field of art, science and literature and on account of this it has been **called a golden age**. A few scholars even call this period a period of renaissance. The cultural progress witnessed during the Gupta period may be called the culmination of Indian intellectual activities. Following were the areas of achievements: **SF:** LAMP - SSC

- Literature: The Sanskrit language became prominent during the Gupta period. Poetry and drama flourished at the court of CG II, at his new capital of Ujjain who kept the **Nine Gems, at his court**
    - Love stories: Meghdootam, Abhigyana Shakuntalam, Vikramorvashi were by Kalidasa. **Mricchakatika** (sattire on society; Love affair) by Shudraka
    - Erotic literature: Kamasutra by Vatsayana
    - Inspiring literature: Panchatantra kathas by Vishnu Sharma
    - **Religious** literature: **Puranas, the Mahabharata and the Manusmriti were recast in their present form** in the Gupta period. Other books such as **Raghuvamsam, Kiritarjuniyam**
    - **Buddhism**: In addition to these the important Buddhist books **Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa** were also compiled in the Gupta Age; **Buddhist lexicon** named **Amarakosa** was compiled by Amarsimha
    - Development of **Kavya style**. Sanskrit now as a secular literature.
    - Sanskrit grammar based on **Panini (wrote Ashtadhyayi)** and **Patanjali** (wrote **Maha**bhasya) was developed
- ⭐Architecture: **Both the Nagara and Dravidian styles** of art evolved during

this period. eg: **Temple at Deogarh Jhansi,** Vishnu reclining on the serpent Shesha (Ananta), **Dashavatara Temple 5th century, Nalanda University**,

- - **Initial sculputures of Shiva at Elephanta Caves** (Climax of cave making) - **Main linkage to Rashtrakutas**
- Metallurgy: Craftsmen were efficient in the art of casting metal statues and pillars. Eg: **Delhi Iron pillar**, Copper stautes of Buddha found at Sultanganj
- Paintings: **Padmapani paintings** at Ajanta paintings and **Paintings at Bagh** belong to this time. They illustrate the life of the Buddha as depicted in the Jataka stories. The paintings at Sigiriya in Sri Lanka were highly influenced by the Ajantha style
- Sculpture: Gupta art is an outcome of the earlier arts of Amravati, Mathura and Bhahrut, although completely different in its own way. The **focus now moved to the female figure**, making **human as a pivot of Gupta sculpture**. Eg: **relief of Goddess Ganga** from Besanagar, seated Buddha from Sarnath, standing statue of Sakyamuni (another name for Buddha)
- ⭐ Science & Tech: Gupta period witnessed a brilliant activity in the sphere of **Mathematics (decimal place value system by Aryabhatta**; while **Brahmagupta** gave rules for **zero**); Astronomy (Varaha Mihir & Aryabhatta explained earth as sphere, occurence of eclipses, heliocentricism), **Astrology and medicine** (transplantation of internal organs was known as per book **Sushruta (Surgeon)** Samhita which was sponsored by CG II)
- Coinage: Samudragupta issued eight types of gold coins. The figures inscribed on them are illustrative of the skill and greatness of Gupta numismatic art. Samudragupta is represented on his coins playing the lute (Veena). **Silver coins**

##### was called '

**rupayaka**

- Social conditions:

##### ' (Rupiah by Sher Shah Suri)

- - **Brahmanism supremacy continued and caste system became rigid**. Religious functionaries were granted land called agrahara, free of taxes for ever.
    - **Though women were idolised (ie. concept of tri-devi** came up) in literature, **mother goddess were worshipped**, **they were accorded lower position**. Gupta era saw **child-marraiges, denial of education, practice of sati (evidence from Eran in MP)**, proliferation of **prostitution**, objectification of women
    - According to **Fahien**, Religion was brahmaism in gangetic valley while buddhism in north west areas. **Buddhist feelings were accommodated eg: Samudragupta patronised** and **allowed** Sri Lankan king **Meghavarman** to build monastery at Bodh gaya
    - Number of untouchables (nirvasita shudras) and out-castes increased.

##### Plight of Chandala is highlighted by Fa-hien

- Gupta administration:
    - Gupta kings adopted pompous titles such as 'Parameshwar', 'Maharajadhiraja', which signify they ruled over lesser kings in their empire. Element of divinity in kingship was present.
    - Council of ministers existed. The empire was divided into 'Bhukti' (province) placed under the charge of an 'Uparika' (viceroy), Bhuktis were divided into districts, placed under the charge of 'vishyapati'. The

sub-districts were called 'Peth' and the village was under 'Gramika'.

- - Guptas did not maintain vast bureaucracy like that of Mauryas. Kumaramatyas were most important officers in Provinces.
    - A large part of the empire was administered by feudatories **(aka Samantas)** Fiscal and administrative concessions to priests and administrators.
    - Civil and criminal laws were clearly demarcated. Road were safe for all
    - Land revenue was fixed at 1/6th rate but was relaxed during famines and increased during wars
    - Brahman supremacy continued. Religious functionaries were granted land called agrahara, free of taxes for ever. They were authorised to collect taxes in those lands
- 2014: Taxila university was one of the oldest universities of the world with which were associated a number of renowned learned personalities of different disciplines. Its strategic location caused its fame to flourish, but unlike Nalanda, it is not considered as a university in the modern sense. Discuss.
    - **Bihar-Nalanda**- est by **Kumargupta** but prominence under harsha and pala kings, famous scholars- **aryabhatta**, Huan tsang and I-tsing spend time here, major centre for mahayana but other schools taught too
    - **NW-Taxila University** had been associated with renowned scholars belonging to different disciplines like Chanakya (wrote – Arthashastra in Taxila itself), Panini (Book: Astadhyayi; language & grammar), Charvaka (Ayurveda, herbal meds) etc, its strategic location at the crossroads of major trade routes i.e, Uttarapath (connected Gandhara in the west to Magadha in the East); The Sindh route from Kashmir to Central Asia caused its fame to flourish.
    - However, despite of the above Nalanda University is regarded as a university in the modern sense due to following reasons
        - Subjects /Curriculum – Taxila primarily an imp centre of Hindu and Buddhist learning with focusing on teaching of Vedic literature and art skills like archery and hunting . Whereas Nalanda University taught more secular subjects like Economics, Politics Astronomy, Mathematics, Science, etc.
        - Students – Nalanda University strong Buddhist curriculum attracted large no. of students from outside India like Korea, Turkey, Mongolia, Tibet, Japan ,etc enabling cross-cultural intellectual discourse . Whereas, Taxila University had mostly students from Indian Janpadas and adjoining areas.
        - Infrastructure – Nalanda- multiple classrooms, extensive library , accomodation for students and teachers, etc Whereas, Taxila – most of the learning was given by teachers at their houses privately.
        - System of Education - Nalanda – formal and centralised system of education. Teachers at Taxila taught according to their perspective and in the process forming their own schools of learning. Nalanda had formal degrees at the end of the course in unlike Taxila.
        - Both Taxila and Nalanda were great centres of learning of their times which had a profound impact on Indian culture and knowledge. Also, recently Nalanda University has opened up after

800 years is testimony to the fact that its importance in education and culture is immense.

## Temple Architecture (with other dynasties)

1. The **temple building architecture reflects a synthesis of arts, ideals of dharma, beliefs**, values and the way of life cherished under Hinduism.
2. Nagara, Dravida, Vesara, etc., are different styles of temple architecture. Pallavas (7th century-9th century) and Cholas (9th century-11th century) were the major kingdoms which epitomized the Dravidian architecture. Chalukyas (7th century-11th century) followed Vesara style of architecture in the Karnataka region. Chalukya art was followed by Hoysala art (13th century).

##### Nagara Style

- - North Indian temples. The **Nagara style has its origin** in the structural temples of the **Gupta period**, especially the **Dashavtara temple of Deogarh .**The **Lingaraj temple**, dating from the 11th century, is one of the **grandest and is regarded as a gem of Nagara** architectural style.
    - The plan is square, exhibits a curving shikhara. Earliest temples had only one shikhara, but in the later periods multiple shikharas came.
    - The entire temple is built on a stone platform (named jagati) with steps leading up to it.
    - The **garbhagriha** is located directly **under the tallest tower**.

##### Dravidian Style

1. **Dravida** architectural features go back to Gupta period
2. Unlike the Nagara temple, the dravida temple is enclosed within a compound wall
3. The front wall has an entrance Gateway in its centre, which is known as Gopuram
4. The main temple tower is known as **Vimana.** The vimana is like a **stepped pyramid** that rise up geometrically rather than the curving shikhara of north India
5. A large water reservoir or a temple tank enclosed in the complex is general in south Indian temples

    1. The Pala rulers (area of modern day bengal, bihar, parts of UP)were great supporters and admirers of Buddhism.
    2. They made monasteries (viharas) and temples in eastern India to promote Buddhism.
    3. **Dharmapala**, the second Pala ruler, founded the **renowned Vikramshila University** near Bhagalpur in Bihar attracting students from all-over India and Tibet. **Devapala**, the Pala king of Bengal, granted five villages for the maintenance of a monastery at Nalanda.
    4. Students and pilgrims throughout South East Asia came to these monasteries for education and religious purposes and returned with specimens of Pala Buddhist art.
    5. Regarding the **Mahabodhi Temple** at Bodhgaya, **many of the sculptures in the niches** in the temple are dated to the **8th century Pala Period**. (super duper generic points)
    6. The **Nalanda bronzes** are reflectant of **Pala Period metal sculptures**. A **miniature terracotta image** of a fasting Buddha, a **six-foot-tall votive** stupa and a black stone statue of Buddha in abhay mudra (fearless mode) from the Pala period reflect the ubiquity of Buddhism then.
    7. **Pala period had several manuscripts** **with Buddhist themes** like images of Vajrayana Buddhist deities on palm leaves. Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita is a good example of a Pala Buddhist palm-leaf manuscript.
    8. **Grand Somapura Mahavira** monastry in Bangladesh; **Spread of Buddhism to Tibet via Palas**

        1. eg: in GJ - Mixture of hindu and muslim characteristics can be seen during Akbar
    2. Initial rulers had less time, focus on consolidation - Built some mosques at Panipat, Lahore
    3. During **Akbar’s** reign, Mughal architecture had **regional influence** (Gujarati, Bengali and Rajput tradition), while **Jehangir and Shahjahan** included **Persian elements** predominantly
    4. Large scale construction **under Akbar- Agra fort in red sandstone**, other forts at Lahore, allahabad, bulit fatehpur sikri- has Jama Masjid,

**Buland darwaza**, **Jodha bai’s palace, Panch Mahal**, **Humanyun’s tomb in Delhi**, use of balconies predomininant

    - Mughal miniature is secular (Hunting campaigns, portraits or scenes from durbar), while Rajasthani and Pahari have religious touch. They included more religious themes as from life of Radha Krishna, Gita Govinda and Rajput lifestyle.
    - Mughal art was largely a royal art, while Rajput style was practiced by folks as well
    - Mughal school features muted colours, giving it a shadow and depth, the Rajasthan school uses bold primary colours which give the painting an abstract look
    - Mughal style is evolved from Persian Miniature painting style, so had marked influence of Persian style which was mixed with local styles. Rajasthani School has a considerable local influence on the other hand.

## Bhakti and Sufi Movement

##### 2014: Sufis and medieval saints failed to modify either the religious ideas and practices or the outward structure of Hindu/ Muslim societies to any appreciable extent. Comment. (Answered below as limitations)

##### 2018: The Bhakti movement received a remarkable re-orientation with the advent of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (SCM).

- - Born in mayapur, Bengal
    - Jatra traditional theatre - musical & dance based relation
    - His sampradaya is called Gaudiya
    - **Founder of ISKCON was the follower of SCM** (thus world’s largest religious structure is being built in Mayapur to honour SCM)
    - Philosophy of Achintya Bheda Abheda (philosophy of **inconceivable one-ness and difference** - by SCM)
    - Write other general points of Bhakti Movement

##### Bhakti Movement

- - **Thing of regionally diverse examples:** Lal Ded, Guru Nanak, Dadu Dayal, Mirabai, Tukaram, Bassavana, SCM, Shankaradeva (don’t worry TT Desk, Nirguna saints se example yaad aa jayenge)
    - The Bhakti movement started in the 6th-7th century AD from the Southern part of the country. It was a religious reform movement which emphasised on single-minded intense devotion to God. It advocated for a personal connection to God through complete devotion and surrender. The movement is classified into ‘nirguna’ and ‘saguna’ traditions

##### Important features:

- - - Unity of God or one God though known by different names. eg: **Achintya Bheda Abheda (philosophy of inconceivable one-ness and difference**

- by SCM)

- - - The **Nirguna sect** even discarded the need of physical depiction of god
        - Belonged to diverse background (Brahamas, lower caste, weavers)
        - **Role of Guru -** needed to guide devotees to embrace salvation
        - Bhakti, intense love and **devotion**, the only **way to salvation**
        - **Condemnation** of complicated rituals, ceremonies and blind faith;

##### Rejection of idol worship

- - - Open-mindedness about deciding religious matters
        - **No distinction of different castes**, higher or low
        - Preaching’s through **local or regional languages** and abdicating elite languages like Sanskrit

##### Impact: (Issues tackled Caste, Religion, Social Evils, Gender/Women, Language, Music, Misc)

- - - According to them there was no distinction and consideration of high and low castes on the basis of birth. Their doors were open to all classes. For example, through the concept of ‘**Langar**’ by Sikh gurus
        - Tried to generate an environment of **good will between the Hindus and the Muslims**. Most of the promoters stressed that **Rama and Rahim were one** and the same. Some of the rulers adopted liberal religious policies under the impact of the Bhakti movement.
        - The Bhakti saints were **social reformers** also. The evil practice of **Sati** received some **set back**.
        - Concept of **Vasudev Kutumbakam** given by Ramanujacharya ⭐ (Statue of Equality)
        - **Women were encouraged** to join kirtans. **Mirabai, Lal Ded** (Kashmiri Shaivite), **Andal** (only female Alwar), Bahinabai (devotee of Lord Vitthoba)
        - Local languages can be sole question: In place of Sanskrit, Bhakti saints preached through the medium of local languages which could be understood very easily. **Surdas used ‘Brij’ dialect.** Tulsi Das composed his works in ‘**Awadhi**’. Shankaradeva popularizing **Assamese**, Chaitanya spreading their message in **Bengali**, Mirabai in Hindi and Rajasthani

##### Gyaneswari was written in Marathi, Basavana’s vachana enriched Kannada

- - - - Even in sufism, local languages were promotes eg: **Amir Khurao used Braj bhasha** with persian for couplets. New local language **Hindavi** emerged from Urdu
        - The greatest gift of the Karnataka's bhakti movement was the development of **Carnatic classical music**. **Puranadaradasa** is considered as the father of Carnatic classical music
        - Emphasised earning of wealth through honest means. It encouraged the value of social service to the poor and the needy. It developed a humanitarian attitude. It pointed out the virtues of contentment and self control; Importance of **mental health** was emphasised in talks of **Lal Ded**
    - Limitations of both Bhakti and Sufism together:
        - There was **no royal patronage** for these movements which could have assist it in propagation. The **upper class of the society was still orthodox** and opposed the changes in the outer structure of the religion.
        - The Sufi saints and Bhakti saints did **not form institutional structures**. In the absence of organization, the lineage of saints could not continue for a long
        - The movement **further divided the Hindu society**. For instance the followers of Kabir came to be known as **Kabir Panthis**
        - The Sufi and Bhakti saints **failed to offer a proper alternative to the social customs** that they attacked. Thus, the absence of an alternative to the social customs left the status of the traditions unaffected
        - Political offices accepted by Suhrawadi and Naqshabandi schools of Sufism; Could not reform hardline muslim rulers such as Aurangzeb
        - These movements **were functioned locally (Raidas had impact in Awadh area)** and there was little or no interaction among these religious leaders. **Lack of integration** was the major region that it failed to leave a large impact
        - While their message was received by a good number of audience, the **memory of the same could not last long due to the nomadic nature** of these saints
    - Famous Leaders:
        - Saguna: **Ramanand** (his disciples were Kabir and Ravidas; Used hindi to propogate), **Namadeva (praised Vithoba), Tukaram** (**founder**

**vari-varkari sect**, Pandherpur MH), Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Tulsidas (wrote ramcharitramanas)

- - - Nirguna: Kabir, Gurunanak, **Ravidas** (propogated place called

##### 'Begumpura’)

##### South vs North Development

- - - **South** was 7-9th Century; Developed vernacular lang like Tamil; Impacted temple arch - not just worship but place to sing dance (eg: Tirupati) + evident in the continued importance of temple festivals in South; Role of various saints;
        - **North** was 14-17th century; Here also diverse languages; Regionally diverse (somewhere Krishna, Somewhere Rama); Shift away from ritualistic and caste- based practices towards a more personal and direct form of devotion; **blended Hindu and Islamic elements due to interaction with Sufism**

##### Sufi Movements

- Sufism was a **liberal reform movement within Islam**. By the end of 10th century, a group of people turned to mysticism (meditative) and asceticism in protest of materialism of caliphate. They were critical of dogmatic interpretation of Quran and Sunna
- Sufism rather stressed the elements of love and devotion as effective means of the realisation of God. In Sufism, self discipline was considered an essential condition to gain knowledge of God. **While orthodox Muslims emphasise external conduct, the Sufis lay stress on inner purity**.
- Sufi saints such as **Moinuddin Chisti, Nizamuddin Auliya,** Fariduddin Ganj-e- Shakar (aka **Baba Farid**) were the pioneer Sufis who are still loved, respected and honoured in India

##### Important features:

- - Concept of **silsila** which was an **unbroken spiritual lineage** connecting the Allah/Prophet with the Pir (master) and finally the Murhsid (disciple)
        - #diagram Allah → Prophet → Pir → Murshid
    - They preached spirituality through **music**, which **remembered God by zikr** (reciting name), this enabled reach to common masses. Their musical gatherings were called sama. Many women too were able to enjoy and contribute to Sufi music. **Khayal style** owes a lot to sufism
    - The Sufis were very **liberal in their religious outlook**. Even today, **Dargahs of Sufi saints are visited by both Hindus and Muslims** and people from all castes. It played a key role in bringing the Hindu and Muslim communities together.
    - They believed in the essential unity of all religions and thus took ideas not only from Quran, but also from Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity etc. In the later period, **Akbar appreciated Suf i doctrines** which shaped his religious outlook and religious policies.
    - They **openly crticised the rulers of their time** eg: Nizamuddin Auliya (**_Hunuz Dilli door ast-with GST_**)never paid visit to any sultan (while there were few sufis who also accepted political offices)
    - Sufis too composed poems and a **rich literature** in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. The most notable writer of this period was **Amir Khusrau** the follower of Nizamuddin Auliya
    - The Sufis rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars.

## Numismatics

##### 2017: How do you justify the view that the level of excellence of the Gupta numismatic art is not at all noticeable in later times?

- - Explain the spectacular nature of Gupta Coins;
    - Reasons for reduced excellence post gupta is:
        - Fall of Roman Empire, loot by Huna tribes impacted the flow of coins in later periods
        - **South Indian coin** designs were confined to **dynastic crests**– boar (Chalukya), bull (Pallava), **tiger (Chola), fish (Pandya)** while some Chalukyan coins left one side blank
        - Focus of rulers shifted to other factors eg: **Harshavardhana focused on Buddhism** (and less on coinage)
        - **Multiple dynasties arose between HV and Gupta** (therefore less focus)
        - Prohibition of idolatry in Islam severely limited the scope of beautifying coins of DS and Mughal period. Kings also had to debase their currencies thus reducing lusture and quality
        - Medieval kings were involved in continuous feuds within and across other dynasties leading to lesser time
        - British coins were monotonous in design as they had textual information on obverse side and portrait of the king or queen on the reverse side

##### Evolution of Numismatics:

Timeline: Punchmarked coins under Magadha (non - uniform eg: Karshapan) → Post Mauryan (Indo-Greek gods/bi-lingual, Satvahanas-lead, Shakas-dates) → Gupta → Southern (Chola had king standing, fish of pandyas) → Rajput (sanskrit names)→ Delhi Sultanate (tanka & jittal by Iltutmish, Rupiah by SSS) → Mughals (Mohur, Illahi coins) → Britishers

- Punch marked coins: Early coins were die-struck manually and therefore were not uniform in shape and design. Punch mark coins of Magadha were very famous, they generally had five symbols. Mauryan coins were also punch marked (as mentioned by Chanakya) eg: Nishka, Satmala, Karshapana
- Post-mauryan phase:
    - Indo Greek Coins: First to issue gold coins, bilingual (greek and pali), Greek gods and bustor heads of kings
    - Satavahanas: First to use lead coins, coins are devoid of any beauty
    - Shakas/Scythians: Head of the king on one side and Buddhist chaitya or stupa on the the other (first to have dates)
- Gupta Age: coins were mainly made of gold; Depicted kings in martial acts (hunting, posing with weapons) as well as leisurely activities (playing the veena, sitting on a couch, talking to queen) on one side and images of goddess on other side; Kumaradevi coins
- Southern:
    - Chalukyan dynasty: With one side haivng animal/temples and other side left blank
    - Pandya: Issued square shaped coins with elephant/fish
    - Chola king Raja Raja-I had the standing king on one side and seated goddess on the other side
    - Coins made under Vijaynagar Dy were called Fanam and Tara
- Rajput Coinage: name of the king in Sanskrit on one side and a goddess on the other side
- Delhi Sultanate: coins did not bear any image, had details of names and year; Silver Tanka and Copper Jital was introduced by Iltutmish; Token currency by MB Tuglaq; Rupiah and the daam by Sher Shah suri
- Mughals: standard gold coin of the Mughals was the Mohur; Akbar brought Illahi coins, Jahangir had coins with couplets and zodiac signs
- Paper currency and coins also brought by Britishers
- Significance of coins: Reveal trade ties with other kingdoms (eg: Roman coins in gupta age), Dates on coins provied value to other info, **Coins help in deciphering languages** (Kharoshti script deciphered using Kushan era coins), Reflect economic conditions of the time (gold coins during gupta and token currency during tughlaq); Coins used even today to celebrate commemorative occasions (75th independence New 20 Rupee coin); **Chronological Understanding of History (**Western Kshatrapas**); Successions: Coins helped understand the line of succession (Chandra Gupta were** different from that of **Samudra Gupta** showing the transition); **Titles** (Satavahanas coins reflect their maternal name)

## Literature

2018: Safeguarding the Indian art heritage is the need of the moment. Comment [Significance & threats to A&C]

- India has a **vast basket of diverse art and cultural** heritage which **need institutional support and encouragement** to address areas critical for their survival and preservation.

##### Threats faced:

- - **Change Agents:** Tourism, Modernisation, Globalisation (Cultural homogenisation), Technology replacing entertainment experience (**puppetry** has been **replaced by TV)**, **Mechanisation of art forms** (machine made sarees)
    - Reducing interest and awareness, Smuggling/Theft (**Stolen artefacts, no uniform database**), Mechanisation of art forms (machine made sarees are cheaper) hurting traditional work, Cultural homogenisation due to globalisation, **Poor maintenance** (eg: poor state of **Ajanta paintings**), **Unregulated tourism,** Encroachment on monuments, Recents incidents at Red Fort (farm law issues); Use Societal change agents - Global/urban/Commercialisation of festivals, Private trade without any authority to claim it - eg: Amravati taken by Britishers (good practise: Sultan Jehan protected Sanchi); Technology replacing entertainment experience; **Decaying state of cultural institutions**
    - **2023:** Ministry of Culture said that **50** ~~of India’s 3,693~~ centrally protected monuments have **gone untraceable**
- Significance:
    - India has a **uniqu**e identity in the world for its art and culture which represents Indian civilization on world platform and if it vanishes the uniqueness of India will get affected.
    - Economic: Tourism potential for art monuments and museums is very high; It creates jobs for a lot of people from art industry including tribals
    - Art heritage also represents “unity in diversity” of India and binds people together
    - Art and culture is also a part of soft power in world politics (Indian Council for Cultural Relations **(ICCR) offers more than 3,500 scholarships annually** aimed at promoting intellectual and academic activities of India)
    - Understanding past had made us a better society today. Eg: culture of urbanisation from Harappan age helped planning of Chandigarh, Chausath Yogini to Parliament
    - Various art are on the verge of extinction such as Manjusha painting of Bihar, traditional art of Puppetry, naga craft, etc.
    - **Soft Power -** International monuments conserved by ASI → **Bamiyan Buddhas (Afghanistan), Angkor Wat (Cambodia)**
- Way Forward:
    - **Strengthening Legislation** and Initiatives: The Antiquity Act of 1947, Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (**AMASR) Act 1958,** Antiquities and Art Treasures Act of 1972 particularly provide for the prevention of smuggling and illegally dealing in antiques
    - Tapping of the **Public—Private Partnership (PPP) models** for sustenance of Arts and Crafts eg **Adopt A Heritage Scheme through Monument Mitra**
    - Strengthening institutions such as ASI - as CAG highlighted ASI needs to be more proactive and vigilant in its efforts

##### Inter-agency collaboration - ISRO and ASI together to help conserve the architecture

- - Cultural awareness: through curriculum modification, oﬄine and online training, involvement of universities and colleges in promoting
    - Preserve art heritage through virtual media, and promote local paintings on products like face maks, wallet, mobile cover, pillow cover, etc
    - Cultural Mapping (explained below): can play a vital role - govt has already launched a mission for the same, but it should now be taken on war footing (considering large scale impact of pandemic on traditional artisans, steps not taken would lead to loss of art)
- Conclusion: It is the duty of every citizen to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.

**Current Measures:** Schemes by Ministry of Culture

- Adopt a Heritage Scheme: Collaborative effort of tourism min, culture min, ASI to preserve monuments and provide basic amenties (clealiness, water, singnages, wifi) through Monument Mitra (which can be pvt, public indus)
- **SCHEME FOR PROMOTION OF CULTURE OF SCIENCE**: Setting up of Science Cities and Science Centres in all the States of the country, implemented by National Council of Science Museums
- **National Mission on Cultural Mapping 2015**: Budget of 3000 crore
    - Cultural map that would chart geographies, artists, resources and institutions, find the gaps, and ensure optimal fund utilisation
    - **What can mapping do?** It can, for instance, locate a derelict cinema and renovate it as an auditorium in a town where there are none, or **create transport and tourism infrastructure around a declining craft village**

##### SAFEGUARDING THE INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE AND DIVERSE

CULTURAL TRADITIONS OF INDIA: cover all recognized domains of ICH such as oral traditions, language, Performing arts, Social practices, rituals, etc.

Implemented by Sangeet Natak Akademi

- Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat (which includes exchanges, cultural mapping of sites), Project Mausam, Seva Bhoj scheme
- CDAC made software named **“Jatan”** that is set to **revolutionise museum experience**; Similarly Darshak app allows details of objects by scanning a QR code; **Digital Hampi**
- Cultural Heritage Youth Leadership Programme by CCRT aims to promote, understand and develop fondness for India’s rich cultural heritage amongst the youth
- Others: Tribal haats, **GI tag** to the local products, e-haat, **AWSAR Scheme - Local heritage at airports**

##### GI Recognition to Chaau Maska in WB - led to global recognition and economic prosperity

- Recent measures: Research centre on Indian Art set up at Zurich Museum by some art historic researchers

##### Why traditional arts are dying:

- After the advent of new methods of communication and entertainment, the traditional art forms and their practitioners have suffered due to the **neglect of the new generation** and steadily decreasing customers

##### Problems:

- - Behavioural changes in people who are now thinking the ancient arts backward
    - **Art forms are not seen as a viable mode of profession** due to the similar cheaper machine made products
    - Traditional puppetry has been replaced by the television, as a form of entertainment
    - Increasing migration has further decreased the number of people who used to practice such arts
- Methods to save them
    - Providing funds to various museums to save the vanishing traditional arts
    - Airport Authority of India (AAI) has launched an initiative “AVSAR” - Airport as Venue for Skilled Artisans Of The Region
    - Ekta Mall – Unity in Handicrafts Diversity is a showroom of handicrafts from different states
    - PM Vikas (Vishwakarma Yojana) - for encouraging traditional arts and handicrafts
    - BHARAT SHRI - Digitalisation of manuscripts
    - Govt should help in linking the products of traditional art and crafts practitioners, with professional enterprises, which can procure the products at reasonable price, so as to project this field as a viable avenue for profession
    - Annual art festivals, more and more awards for recognition, **using international platforms (eg: COP 13 logo of CMS had Kolam** which traditional art form of South India)
    - Supporting **e-commerce** websites to sell the Art forms

##### Decaying of Cultural Institutions

Attached bodies under MoC: ASI, National Archives of India

**Autonomous Bodies unde MoC**: Akademis (Sahitya, Sangeet, Nat. School of Drama, Lalit Kala Akademi), Buddhist Inst, libraries, museums, zonal cultural centres

**Cultural institutions serve the purpose of conservation of one’s heritage and its passing on to future generations**along with its modern adaptations. In India although some cultural institutions have been and still are pillars of strength, but a lot many are fading into oblivion due to host of factors mainly poor governance, stagnation and poor upkeep.

##### Reasons

- The **head** of theses institutions is normally a **generalist senior bureaucrat** who has no special knowledge or work experience in the cultural domain of that institution **(often treated as ‘punishment’ posting)**
- **Budgetary allocation** for upkeep, modernisation, digitalisation is hardly significant, the case of museums in Indian is a glaring example (**Total budget of FY24 ~3200 crore is equivalent to cost of 2 Rafale jet planes**)
- No proper policy or guidelines are formed to guide the working of these institutions. The case of ASI digging for gold at the behest of epiphany of old sadhu pointed this.
- Dilapidated structures, **prone to hazards**, like the fire in Nehru Museum in Delhi, **waterlogged Kesaria stupa** in Bihar
- National Museum of India, National Archives as well as Indira Gandhi National Centre are set to be demolished to make way for the Central Vista Project (relocation is complex process; The artefacts at National Museum still lack complete inventory)
- Misplaced priorities: Committee formed in 2016 to study ‘evolution of Indian culture from 12,000 years ago’ did not submit report even in 2021 (RTI revealed)
- WF: The need of the hour is the interjection of ICT, dedicated policy, regular fund allotment in budget, specialised experts as heads.

##### Challenges wrt stolen Artefacts

- An integrated database of existing and stolen artefacts hardly exists in India with the National Mission for Monument and Antiquities, hence sufficient information on theft cases is very difficult. The Ministry of Culture’s initiative to document the seventy lakh antiquities in its possession in 2007 has only reached eight lakhs until 2014
- The **CBI,** which handles antiquities theft as part of its special crimes division, is

**overburdened** and also does not have the requisite qualifications.

- Some state governments have special wings as part of their police force but these too are understaffed and unqualified
- The **process of registering antiquities** under the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act 1972 is **extremely cumbersome** and the act is outdated also
- Fear of unnecessary government attention also deters registration
- The CAG report on Antiquities in 2013 remarks about the country’s poor acquisition, documentation and conservation systems like museums

##### Indian Culture Abroad

India had established commercial contacts with other countries from the earliest times. It had inevitably resulted in the spread of Indian languages, religions, art and architecture, philosophy, beliefs, customs and manners

China: **Connected by land routes, sea routes**, travellers Fahien and Hiuen Tsang, Buddhist monks visited from both sides eg: Bodhidharman from south india. Japan also impacted

Central Asia: Cultural exchanges were there as visible from discoveries of ancient stupas, temples, monasteries, images and paintings found in all these countries

Tibet: Buddhism, **Tibetan alphabet** was devised with the help of Indian scholars,

##### Buddhist monks during attack on Pala dynasty took shelter in Tibet

Sri Lanka: **Art of stone carving went to SL from India**, famous paintings of Sigiriya were modelled on the Ajantha paintings, visit of Ashoka’s children with saplings of bodhi tree, role played by Ashwa Gosh for Hinayan Buddhism

Malay Archipelago had remained an important link between India and the Far East. Several Hindu kingdoms existed here between fifth to fifteenth centuries A.D. The **most important Hindu kingdom in the big island of Sumatra was Sri Vijaya**

The Indians learnt many new things from the foreigners for examples **minting of gold coins from Greece** and Rome, **art of making silk from China**, art of growing betel from Indonesia, etc. The art and culture of the various countries got itself reflected over the Indian culture, but than this was reflected in the other countries also.

Modes of spread of Indian culture: Travellers, Expeditions (to SL during Ashoka), Trade expansion (spread of buddhism to Malaya during guptas), Naval power (Bay of bengal termed as Chola lake)
