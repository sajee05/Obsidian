**_Madhav Agarwal and Ratnesh Agrawal_** _— two friends, one mission, and a bond forged through shared dreams. From school classrooms to college corridors, their journey was always side by side. United by a common goal of cracking the UPSC, they spent over 300 hours on video calls — dissecting concepts, solving doubts, and building the notes that would become the backbone of their preparation._

_Madhav went on to secure AIR 211 in CSE-2023 and then soared to_ **_AIR 16 in CSE-2024_**_. Now set to join the_ **_Indian Administrative Service_**_, he is living proof that quiet determination, when sustained with laser focus, can turn even the toughest dreams into destiny._

_Ratnesh, who reached the_ **_UPSC interview stage in CSE-2023_**_, chose a different but equally powerful path. With the same intensity and sharp thinking that marked his preparation, he stepped into the world of real estate. Today, he’s a_ **_dynamic builder in Indore_** _— shaping skylines and lives with a vision rooted in public purpose and entrepreneurial fire._

_These notes are a result of their shared struggle, deep friendship, and uncompromising pursuit of excellence — a_ **_gift to future aspirants_**_, from two dreamers who refused to settle for average, each leaving a mark in his own way._

**Note:** These notes are the result of a group effort over the past few years. You'll find pink (or other coloured) highlights at the start of many topics—these usually mark key terms, definitions, quotes, etc., based on our memory cues at the time. While most content is updated, some sections—especially in **GS3**—may contain older material, so do cross-check and update where needed. Don’t get confused by the highlights; use what’s useful and feel free to build your own notes from them.

To assist with updates, we’ve added a **Current Affairs & Value Addition** section at the end of the notes. It can help you **enrich your answers** and also serves as a reference on how to make concise, effective short notes.

    2. 2019: Indian government has recently strengthed the anti-terrorism laws by amending the unlawful activities (Prevention) Act, (UAPA), 1967 and the NIA Act. Analyze the changes in the context of prevailing security environment while discussing scope and reasons for opposing the UAPA by human rights organisations
        1. Recent amendments in UAPA: The amendment allows government to designate individuals apart from organisation suspected to have terror links as 'terrorists'.
            1. Apart from investigation by ACP, DCP of Police, Investigation can also be done by officers of NIA (inspector rank and above)
            2. Permission of seizure of property related to terrorism be taken from DG of NIA (rather than DG of Police)
        2.

            1. Emerging linkage of terrorism with OC called for coherent approach, thus calling for NIA amendment
            2. Allow NIA to speed up investigation which was currently delayed by states
            3. Members of banned terror groups often form new ‘indv’ outfits → But domestic law did not allow indv designation as terrorists (background of Masood Azhar issue)
        4. Criticism by HR org:
            1. UAPA
                1. State can arbritary declare Terrorist without objective grounds- violate art 14,19,21

Current Affairs 2021: Delhi HC redefined the boundaries of Section 15 of the UAPA-Terrorist activity cannot be broadly defined to include ordinary penal offences. By doing so, it raised the bar for the State to book an individual for terrorism under the UAPA

- - - - 1. violate right to repuation by terming as T for just possesing books of particular ideology- neglect academic intrests,social boycott in future jobs
                2. Right to dissent - neglect Demo.
                3. As per MHA data, there has been 72% rise in UAPA cases in 2019 compared to 2015. The conviction rate is mere 2.2%
                4. Vague definitions eg of terrorist act u/s sec 15 of UAPA - allows misuse

            3. Economic trap: Cheque book diplomacy
    3. 2015: ISIS: Religious indoctrination via digital media, Mission, dangers posed
        1. ISIS- want to est Islamic state based on sharia law- recently claimed at est province in kashmir
        2. Why ISIS challange?- Pak ISI involement, ISIS losing territory elsewhere,India hotbed of radicalisation-online,communal riots, police injustice to minority,AFSPA
        3. India fight towards ISIS- Not much influence compared to other C,Liberal spritual minority, FR-justice in courts

        1. In light of the growth of IT sector in the country-NCSP annonced but actual implementation is still short of required.
        2. Features:
            1. Creating a secure cyber ecosystem, generating trust in IT transactions.
            2. The NCIIPC is to be the nodal agency to protect critical infrastructure, while another 24×7 agency, CERT-In, is to coordinate all emergency response and crisis management.

        3. Criticism of policy
            1. Mainly covers defensive and responsive measures - no mention of offensive capability.
            2. The policy avoids addressing privacy vs security, censorship vs freedom of speech
            3. Most of the cyber crimes are expected to be dealt with by the local police under state government in combination with outside consultants. No efforts are taken to upgrade skills of local police.
            4. NCSP is silent on dealing with threats emanating from new technologies- need to update policy regularly
            5. CSP fails to address the overreach of state in cyberspace. Further, with state outsourcing to private companies to build systems for mass surveillance, there is every chance of private data falling into wrong hands.- Aadhar issue
            6. India less CS workforce where as China has around 5 lakh personnel
    6. 2013: Cyber warfare? India’s preparedness? Need for Digital Armed Force

            3. NCIIPC- protects critical infra,other institutions,cert in 24/7 certy fin etc
            4. 5th Global conf on cyber space in india 2019 for pvt,int collab
        5. Way forward:
            1. Cyber diplomacy- coop on cyber intelligence like tradional int coop RAW,mossad

            3. Breaking means used to radicalise the youth
            4. Using technology
            5. Intelligence gathering of local involved
            6. Try to reform local instead of harsh punishment- will prevent vicious cycle of recruitment- elder brother killed, younger joins
            7. Cooperation b/w police forces and border guarding forces
            8. Augmenting state forces by centre
        2. Ways to manage favourable perception among locals
            1. Ideological- Intelligence agents helping to change perception to pro- country
            2. Role model- IAS,IPS rewarded in front of youth

    1. 2018: India’s proximity to two of the world’s biggest illicit

opium-growing states has enhanced her internal security concerns. Explain the linkages between drug trafficking and other illicit activities such as gunrunning, money laundering and human trafficking. What countermeasures should be taken to prevent the same?

- - 1. Introduction: Indian lies between Golden Crescent on the west and Golden Triangle in the east (India has become both destination and transit)
        2. Possible ways they are linked:
            1. Financial channel use, IT expertise use
            2. Using cross border routes of drug traff to facilitate HT, gun smuggling
            3. Fund generated from HT, Drugs requires money laundering
            4. Youth on drugs- easy prey for T’s,HT, need guns for domestic use-promote arms smuggling
            5. Same linkages of all OC’s with authorities- use of each other contacts eg custom and drug mafia- blackmail- arms smuggling too
            6. Barter system with one another
        3. Give examples from Eastern,western and myanmar,sea borders
        4. Countermeasures
            1. _Written below_

    1. 1985: Drug abuse and drug addiction: Challenges, steps for victims
        1. Intro- AIIMS - “Magnitude of Substance Use in India” to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.
            1. Around 5 crore Indians reported to have used cannabis and opioids at the time of the survey
            2. **Punjab** followed by West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.
        2. Reasons
            1. **Stress Buster:** studies or work pressure, an unemployed youth.
            2. **Peer pressure-** glamour attached to drug taking, youth from other state in metropolitan cities, social media.
            3. **Flaws in the legal system:** unable to tackle drug cartels,

crime syndicates and ultimately the **ISI**which is the **biggest supplier of drugs.**

- - - 1. Smuggling of drugs- neighbouring countries
        
        1. Challenges:
            1. Legally available drugs such as tobacco are a huge problem
            2. Currently, the country has more of the young population with disposable income where willingness to take risk is high. The availability of drugs in the country makes it a lethal mix
            3. Lack of availability of rehabilitation centres
            4. Stigma attached to mental health, drug abuse
        2. Way Forward
            1. Tackle cause rather than act- Mental health issues, vicious cycle leading to inc of depression.
            2. Voluntary support as well as support from from physicians, psychologists, family is required
            3. Society needs to understand that drug-addicts are victims and not criminals
            4. Strict action is required from police officers at the excise and narcotics department to curb the problem of drug menace in the country
            5. Radical political decisions like that one of alcohol prohibition in Bihar may be another solution. When people do not

exercise self-control, a state has to step in, as part of the Directive Principles of State Policy (Article 47)

- - - 1. Education curriculum should include chapters on drug addiction, its impact and also on de-addiction. Proper Counselling is another alternative
            2. Strictly implement the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act

##### Basics of Cyber Security

- Facts
    - Cybercrimes increased by 63.5% in 2019 compared to 2018 - NCRB Report
    - According to McAfee report, India ranked 5th in terms of ecommerce security breaches- alamworthy as India terms as software capital of the world. Cost of downtime 30 cr a day if cyber security attack on public infra.
    - FBI Report 2019 - India 3rd among Top 20 that are victim of cyber crimes
    - Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) remarked that cyber crimes increased by 500% during the pandemic
- Meaning of CS:
    - As per _Section 2 of IT Act 2000_ - CS means protecting equip/computer/comm devices/info stored therein from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction;
- Significance and Need
    - 3rd largest internet users in the world (700 mn ➡➡ 974 mn by 2025)
    - Strong govt. impetus towards e-governance (may bring personal data under public domain)- Digital India mission
    - Large % of exports are IT centric (software capital)
    - Recent cyberattacks on nuclear plants etc (1 Cyber attack in every 10 min)- Critical Infra-powergrids,vaccine data systems.
    - Start up push (India 3rd largest in world for tech startup)
    - Cyber**in**security of indv, organisation and states rose in time of COVID-19

- largely due to increase in screen time

- Types of cyber threats
    - Cyber crimes
        - Idenitity theft - steal personal info- FB Cambridge Analytica
        - Israel Pegasus spyware on whatsapp; Kundunkulam attack by ‘Dtrack’, PMO Twitter account hack
        - Denial of service attacks,Child sexual offences,Cyberstalking,cyberbullying
        - Cyber defamation: It is defamation by anything which can be read, seen or heard with the help of computers.
        - Corporate smear: It is a false rumour about a company, its management or its stock that is posted on the Internet. This is bad for business.
    - Cyber terrorism
        - By non state actors- Osama 9/11 stock market use for T
        - Threat to India’s nuclear plants, Power grids, Critical security infra
        - Christchurch attack
    - Cyber warfare
        - By state actors- emerging as 5th domain of warfare
        - Value of traditional deterrents such as land size GDP size have become less (as even small island naitons can engageg in cyber warfare)
        - Cyber tensions bw US China, Russia invol in Trump election,Attack by US and Israel on Iran nuclear prog
        - Alleged attack by chinese firm on India’s power system and ports in Oct 2020 (as per US Firm’s Report)
- Challenges
    - Digital illiteracy: _Write fact if any;_ Lack of digital hygiene where people click suspicious emails/texts
    - Shortage of trained workforce: required 10 lac vs current state 62k (as per analyst estimates)
    - Imported equipments: Dependence as high as 70% ~ prone to ‘backdoor’ vulnerabilities- mostly from China- Huewai issue recently
    - Lack of comprehensive data protection law
    - International vulnerabilty- US PRISM prog -collects international communication of domestic/foreign citizens from FB,google- highlighted by Snowden; Wikileaks highlighted that CIA has advanced capabilities with which it can leave ‘false finger prints’ confusing investigators to lead to other nation states rather than USA
    - Aadhar card breach of UIDAI cheif on twitter by French Hacker- shows insitutional vulnerability
    - Lack of coordination among insititutions: Blame game and turf wars b/w groups whereas cyberspace has no boundaries; Pvt sector playing limited role (overlapping responsibilities fails to create proper accountability)
    - Low reporting of cybercrimes
    - Economic challenges: eg: Posed by bank mergers - diff in sec softwares - threats are ⬆
    - Technocracy- Increased power of Twitter,FB- banning of people of one ideology eg donald trump- sets dangerous precedent
    - Major resources of nations are concentrated to protect military & strategic targets, but the civilian infra such as healthcare system is also under attack (as evident from attacks during pandemic)
    - Sophetication of cyber crimes - Pegasus spyware could be installed with just Whatsapp missed call (zero click attack)
- Measures taken
    - Institutional
        - Under PMO:
            - National Information Board (NIB) is apex policy-making wing on cyber security headed by NSA
            - Office of National Cyber Security Coordinator was estab in 2015 to advice PM on strategic CS issues
            - For Criticial Infra: National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) which comes under NTRO is mandated to battle cyber security threats in strategic CII such as air control, nuclear and space (NTRO comes under PMO)
        - For Non-Criticial Infra: CERT-In = National nodal agency for CS under Meity; There are sectoral certs as well such CERT-fin
            - Cyber Swachhta Kendra is operated by CERT-In
        - Under Defence Ministry: The Defence Cyber Agency (wef 2019) is a tri-service command of the Indian Armed Forces tasked with handling cyber security threats
        - Under Ministry of Home: (there are many other bodies as well)
            - Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C): The I4C will assist in centralising cyber security investigations, prioritise the development of response tools and bring together private companies to contain the menace
            - National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCCRP) is citizen-centric initiative portal to report any cyber crime; Special emphasis is for children, women
        - Apart from this MEA coordinates India’s cyber diplomacy push at international forums
    - Awareness
        - National Security Directive issued by Cabinet Committee on Security which aims to classify telecom products and their sources under the ‘trusted’ and ‘non-trusted’ categories based on the methodology developed by National Cyber Security Coordinator
        - Cyber Surakshit Bharat- for cyber hygeine among citizens
        - Asked all telecom operators to undertake **‘information security audit’** of their networks to check for check for any ‘backdoor’ or ‘trapdoor’ vulnerabilities
        - '_RBI_ Kehta Hai' Campaign to improve
    - Legislative
        - Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 (based on the recommendation of Justice BN Srikrishna Committee) to secure citizens data
        - Information Technology Act, 2000 (amended in 2008) to provide a legal framework for transactions carried out by means of electronic data interchange,for data access for cybersecurity etc
        - National Cyber Security Policy 2013
    - International
        - Status- US wants militarilisations of digital space, others resisting
        - Paris call- For common principles of C.S- but countries differneces on cyber security wrt role of pvt sector- west wants pvt,china russia wants state control
        - Budapest convention-Sole legally binding Int treaty to protect against cyber crimes, provides power and procedures,int coop,
            - India- not joined due to data intrusion by tech co.,other states.
        - India recently voted in favour of a Russian-led UN resolution to set up a separate convention as an opposition to Budapest convention
- Way Forward
    - A committee set up by the IRDAI has recommended the introduction of a cyber insurance policy - need to be expedited
    - There is a need for institutional coherence (jargon which means coordination 😛) along with doctrinal clarity (Currently there is no single doctrine which guides all players in CS space; A doctrine on lines of ‘no first use’ in nuclear space is needed to guide everyone) - A clear doctrine can boost citizen confidence, build trust among allies and clearly signal intent to potential adversaries
    - Need for effective 24/7 well trained cyber police, adhere to cyber security standards for govt,pvt processes- eg ISO guidelines for CS managment.
    - Need to develop domestic capabilities eg; through schemes such as Production Linked Incentives
    - Cyber forensics, security audits of govt, pvt org
    - Cyber detterence (offensive + defensive), Cyber diplomacy
    - Enhanced international cooperation
    - Promote cyber hygeine of citizens
    - **Uday Kotak Comittee -** recommended Risk management and IT

committee: Top-500 listed companies should have risk management committee of boards for cyber security

- - Skill building of youth needs to be tapped as they play big role in devising cyber securtiy solutions to effectively vaccinate digital products against viruses and cyberattacks eg through MOOC courses, partnership with reputed institutes
    - Standing Committee on IT chaired by Rao Inderjit Singh recommended reducing govt. dependence of foreign cloud servers
    - Data prot law- Effective imp
    - Social media co- Should not turn democracy into techocracy
    - Email Accounts of EEs belonging to IGCAR, BARC, SEBI, ISRO were hacked and the data provided in plain text over dark web; Its high time govt. **two-factor authentication** is introduced in email accounts of EEs of sensitive organisations
- Conclusion - In the age of digital interdependece, technology is insepearble so insurance for cyber risks only way.

2020: Discuss different types of cyber crimes and measures required to be taken to fight the menace

_Ans: Both covered above_

2016: Potential threats, Security framework to control cyber crime

_Ans: Both covered above;_ Potential threats - write using type of cyber threats

2018: Data Security: B. N. Srikrishna Committee Report, strengths and weaknesses of the report; Draft bill (comparison)

Ans: Key features of the 2019 Bill

- Personal data (data that can identify an individual): Various types such as Critical personal data, Sensitive personal and General personal data
- Applicability: Processing of personal data by Government, companies incorporated in India and foreign companies dealing with personal data of individuals in India; Processing of data by fiduciaries only if consent is provided by the individual
- Obligations of data fiduciary (an entity or individual who collects and decides the means and purpose of processing personal data):
    - Personal data can be processed only for specific, clear and lawful purpose
    - Transparency and accountability measures such as security safeguards and instituting grievance redressal mechanisms
- Rights of the data principal (the individual whose data is being collected and processed):
    - Obtain confirmation from the fiduciary on whether their personal data has been processed
    - Right to be forgotten which will allow users to erase their personal data published online
    - Restrict continuing disclosure of their personal data by a fiduciary, if it is no longer necessary or consent is withdrawn.
- Data Protection Authority: which may take steps to protect interests of individuals, prevent misuse of personal data and ensure compliance with the Bill
- Central government may direct data fiduciaries to provide it with **any**

**non-personal data** and **anonymized personal data** for better targeting of services

- Transfer of data outside India:
    - Critical personal data can must be stored _and_ processed only in India
    - Sensitive personal data must be stored within India but can be copied elsewhere provided certain conditions are met
    - Personal data other than sensitive and critical personal data don’t have such localisation mandates
- Criticism of the Bill
    - Deviance from Justice B N Srikrishna committee
        - Data Protection Authority’s composition is dominated by the government, as contrasted with the diverse and independent composition
        - Blanket power of exemption from all provisions of the law (including access to personal data without consent, citing national security, investigation and prosecution of any offence, public order) in favour of a government agency
            - Section 35 uses the words when “necessary or expedient” →

it should be replaced with “necessary and proportionate” (Puttaswamy Judgement)

- - Other criticism
        - The bill stipulates that social media intermediaries allow for the **voluntary verification of their accounts** by **any users** who use their services from India or register from within India. However,

the proof users need to submit to the social media intermediary to verify their accounts is unclear. No other country has the provision for a voluntary verification mechanism of this nature

- - - Section 91—a provision clarifying that govt reserves the right to

interpret any policies for the benefit of India’s digital economy - as long as this does not involve the use of personal data that can be directly used to identify an individual

- - - Current Status
            - Bill under scrutiny of Joint Committee
            - For detailed clause by clause comparison: [https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/personal-data-protecti](https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-how-it-differs-draft-bill) [on-bill-2019-how-it-differs-draft-bill](https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-how-it-differs-draft-bill)
            - Weakness of draft (UPSC)- Now focus on bill

**Non Personal Data - Kris Gopalakrishnan Committee** (_Unlike the above bill which focuses on personal data this is NPD)_

- Gopalkrishnan Committee has taken an **infrastructural view of data**. (below points explain this statement)
    - Data collected from various communities are considered to be ‘owned’ by the relevant community. Such ‘community ownership’ means that the data should be shared back with all those who need it in society, whether to develop domestic digital businesses or for producing important digital public goods.
    - Infrastructures are to be equitably provided for all businesses. Data have similar characteristics. What is needed, however, is to treat data as infrastructure, or ‘commons’, so that data are widely available for all businesses.
- Recommendations
    - Suggested that non-personal data generated in India be allowed to be harnessed by various domestic companies and entities
    - Suggested a separate national legislation and a separate authority to oversee non-personal data
    - Classified non-personal data into three main categories
        - **Public non-personal data:** It involves all the data collected by the government and its agencies during execution of all publicly funded works.
            - E.g. census, data collected by municipal corporations on the total tax receipts.
        - **Community non-personal data:** It involves any data identifiers about a set of people who have either the same geographic location, religion, job, or other common social interests.
            - E.g. The metadata collected by ride-hailing apps, telecom companies, electricity distribution companies.
        - **Private non-personal data:** It can be defined as those which are produced by individuals which can be derived from application of

proprietary software or knowledge. E.g data generated by companies like Google, Amazon etc.

- Importance of NPD: Use for targetted delivery of service; Useful for Indian entrepreneurs to develop new and innovative services or products
- Issues: No clarity over grievance redressal; Favours big tech cos, IPR issues
- Way Fwd: Like many other countries, India too will have to define non-personal data in a manner that protects intellectual property rights, serves genuine public interest and promotes innovation

##### Money Laundering

- Definition/Meaning:
    - According to INTERPOL Money laundering is concealing the identity of ‘proceeds of crime’ and projecting it as as ‘untainted property’
    - In simpler terms converting dirty money into clean money using complex processes
- **Objectives**: Hide criminal activities; Avoid tax scrutiny while using the laundered money(round tripping)
- **Tools used**: Smurfing (Dividing amt into smaller amts.), Hawala transactions (remittance w/o physical movt. of cash), Currency exchange, Shell cos., Fake investment, Fake invoices, Real estate investment ,using cryptocurrency for ML
- **3 staged process** of ML: _Refer images below_
- Impacts of ML
    - Economic
        - Tax evasion, volatility in markets, inflationary spiral,parralel economy
        - Corruption, Black money laundered
        - Policy distortion
        - Impacting FDI and investor confidence
        - Tax avoidance- welfare prog
    - Political
        - Financing terrorism,drug trafficking(Golden tri crescent),arms smuggling,antiques,envirometal illegal trade etc
        - Using NGOs to hamper developmental projects by external actors with vested interests
    - Social
        - Continuance of crimes and disharmony in society
        - Promotion of culture of bribery among officials → Impacts EoDB
        - Hawala culture- increase chances of fraud in society
    - International
        - Decline in credibility of sovereign bonds- eg Pakistan after being the grey list
- Challenges in tackling ML
    - Reluctance on part of countries to share info eg: Switzerland, Tax havens such as Cayman Islands
    - Sheer volume in India’s banking system eg:
    - The legal framework are not able to match up with the speed of growing technologies
    - Lax attitude of banking staff towards influential & powerful people promotes ML (eg: they do not exercise KYC norms properly)
    - Golden nexus between _you know who_
    - Weak and fragmented enforcement architecture having separate agencies to deal with ML, cyber crimes, terror crimes, etc
- Steps taken
    - International
        - FATF is an intergovernmental body established by the G7 summit in Paris in 1989 and responsible for setting global standards on anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism; Regular reviews are done under FATF
            - New-age challenges before FATF: Challenges to the global counter-terror and anti money laundering regime: including bitcoins and cyber currencies, illegal trafficking of wildlife as a source of funding, use of artificial intelligence in terror attacks and biowarfare as part of the wider challenge of the coronavirus pandemic
        - UN convention Trans National against Organised Crime (UNTOC), UN Convention against Corruption wef 2005 - Both widen the scope of ML by applying to TOC,C and urge states to create regulatory regime to combat
        - Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, under which the countries have agreed to take necessary measures. Initiative by OECD
        - The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO): It encourages its members to take necessary steps to combat Money Laundering in securities and futures markets
    - Domestic efforts
        - Criminalised money laundering under the PMLA, 2002.
        - Criminalised money laundering under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act), as amended in 2001.
        - Enforcement Directorate (ED) for investigation and prosecution of cases under the PMLA.
        - Financial Intelligence Unit – India (FIU-IND) for receiving, processing, analysing and disseminating information relating to suspect financial transactions
        - CERT-Fin on lines of CERT-in.
- Way forward
    - Several countries impose tougher monitoring norms on bank accounts operated by persons holding important position in govt, bureaucracy or their relative- i.e check neglect of KYC norms
    - Adhere to all standards of FATF in letter and spirit both mandatory and optional
    - Co-ordination btw inv agenices like ED,CBI,NCB in case of TOC linkages
    - Use of AI,Data mining for analysis on ML
    - Speedy trial under special courts of PMLA
    - Explore treaties on line of US FATCA with other countries for info on ML by Indians
    - Weeding out the black sheep NGOs (focused and proportionate measures, in line with the risk-based approach)

**PMLA**-core of legal framework for ML from 2002, provides for confistication of proceeds of crime

PMLA,2012

- Law links the provisions of Indian law with the laws of foreign countries.
- Adds the concept of reporting entity which would include a banking company, financial institution, business or profession.
- The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 levied a fine up to Rs. 5 lakh. The amendment act removed this upper limit.
- The act has provided for provisional attachment and confiscation of property it has reason to believe that the offence of money laundering has taken place.

PMLA, 2018

- Amendment in definition of “proceeds of crime”: It now allows the ED to proceed against assets of equivalent value located even outside the country.
- Corporate frauds: Corporate frauds is being included as scheduled offence under PMLA, so that Registrar of Companies can report such cases for action by Enforcement Directorate for money laundering probe.(Nirav modi, Vijay mallya,mehul choksi)

![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 4.jpeg>)

![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 5.jpeg>)Placement- deposit money into fin inst, Layering- several bank-bank transfers,most complex making it hard to trace,Integration- money reenters mainstream economy in legitimate form, diff to catch here in this stage if in previous 2 not caught.

2013: Money laundering poses a serious security threat to a country’s economic sovereignty. What is its significance for India and what steps are required to be taken to control this menace?

_Ans: Economic Impacts covered above; Way ahead covered above_

##### Communication networks, role of media and social networking sites

- Communication Network- CN part of of our critical information infrastructure which was defined in the IT Act, 2000 as “the computer resource, the

incapacitation or destruction of which, shall have debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health or safety.”

- Significance
    - crucial to the connectivity of other critical infrastructure, viz. telecom, civil aviation, shipping, railways, power, nuclear, banking, intelligence agencies, space, defence, and government networks.
    - present digital age- vital for economic security
- Concerns
    - Cyber attacks,increasing complexity of IT systems,wireless tech-more chances of attack
    - Hardware/software from abroad- Huwaie china issue
    - Much of infra in pvt hands- see security auditing etc adding to their costs
    - PNB-swift issue nirav modi- neglect of critical infra for risk mgmt
- Way forward
    - Domestic production of telecom equipment eg Reliance 5G
    - Electronic devices domestic production funds by Meity
    - Expertise by CERT-in to security agencies,better analytical capability , secured intra gov communication network,data protection etc
    - Write measures of cyber security management(above)
- Media
    - Positive Role
        - Coverage in large number of vernacular languages
        - Busting propaganda spread by LWE
        - 4th pillar of D,inform and educate people(corona),bridge btw people and govt
        - Hathras coverage- make public servants accountable
    - Negative Role/ Challenges to IS
        - Coverage of security operations - ending up helping TGs eg: 26/11 attacks
        - Irresponsible coverage of communal conflicts → Polarising the society further
        - Paid news - Supporting vested interests rather than truth
        - Media Trials - Impacts psychology of the person targetted(SSR case)
    - Need for self-regulation
        - Just like F of S&E , media also has reasonable restrictions- decency,morality,public order,defamation,security of india
            - Need for accuracy in reporting- shun irrelavant content to feed 24/7 cycle
            - National security paramount
            - Not to broadcast visuals harming peace-Palghar
            - Superstion- need disclaimer if news about it-Burari- educate people
            - Shun biasness
- Social Media
    - Positive Role
        - Empowering the vulnerable eg: Baba ka Dhabha
        - Real time engagement with people eg: MEA on Twitter
        - Immense role played during crisis communication such as COVID-19, disasters
        - Seeking feedback & inputs from citizens - e-governance
        - Partnership to lift up tribals eg: GOAL (Going Online As Leaders) - M/o Tribal + FB
        - Social movements- Enviromental, George Floyd, Feminist - things that tv media ignores
    - Negative Role
        - Buisness model of SM- advertisement scrolling- hardens beliefs- threat to peace eg US,India political divisions
        - Post truth world- Spread of fake news and hate message eg:
        - Subversion of democratic process eg: Cambridge Analytics
        - Identity theft and sell of personal data - Hampers fundamental rights
        - Used by extremists to fund, recruit, spread propoganda,train,execute(christhchurch incident)
        - Cyber bullying and pornography
        - Excessive power to tech co’s- selective blocking of content
    - Challenges:
        - Balancing b/w freedom of speech vs internal security
        - Anonymity and encryption - Challenges in regulation
        - Challenges coverd under cyber security above
    - Government efforts to counter Internal security challenges
        - Messaged to not forwards hateful content otherwise penal action-Delhi govt
        - Co-op with social media co- block fake,hateful content fast(eg whatsapp limit on forwarding)
        - Rajiv Gauba Committee recommended on making social media platforms accountable
        - banning porn,child pornography,blue whale games
        - Chinese apps as threat to national security-pubg,tiktok
    - Way forward
        - Youth sensitisation- demographic divident should not become D, disaster- attahced to tiktok,insta
        - Awareness for facts based content and not biased content
        - Int-coop to block extremist content

##### Linkages between development and spread of extremism

- How are they linked? Two Schools of thought
    - Extremism is the cause and Dev is the effect — calls for L&O approach
    - Dev is the cause and Extremism is the effect — calls for Dev approach

##### Left Wing Extremism (LWE)

- History and goal of LWE:
    - Started with 1967 Naxalbari,Believer in Marx idea of overthrow of state and estn dictatorship of proletariot
    - Claims to represent most oppresed untouched by India’s dev
- Trend:
    - From 200+ distt in 2004 ➡➡ 160 in 2014 ➡➡ 90 in 2019
    - Currently, 30% distt. account for 90% violence by LWE
    - Entry in newer areas such as Kerela (while reduction in older areas)
    - ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 6.jpeg>)
- Good statements for LWE
    - Red Corridor (from Pashupati to Tirupati)
    - _‘Discontent’_ provided fertile ground for spread of LWE
    - From Friction to Fusion (subtitle of 2nd ARC)
    - _2nd ARC 7th Report - Mixture of ‘police stick’ and ‘development carrot’ as panacea to tacke LWE_
    - Success story of AP: Grey Hounds + balance b/w dev and L&O approach (suggest as role model)
- ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 7.jpeg>)**Recent attacks**: Naxals blew up a bus using landmine in Narayanpur dist (CG), killing 5 policemen
- Causes/determinants:
    - Land Related Issues
        - _Why Land is imp? Primary factor of production in agri + cultural significance_
        - Displacement: As per PC Report 2008, >40% displaced = tribals of which 70% not rehabilitated
        - Eviction from forests: Done through Forest Conservation Act 1980

→ disrupted age old tribal-forest r’ship, excessive power to forest bureucracy

- - - Land alienation by zamindars, money lenders, pvt. contractors; Poor imp pf laws prohibiting transfer from tribal to non-tribal
        - Illegal mining (resource curse)
        - Non fulfilment of post independence land reform commitment
    - Socio-Economic Reasons
        - Poverty eg: Kareem Nagar (TG) 95% compared to state avg 50%
        - No access to basic resources eg: 2% rural houses have clean tap water in Dantewada
            - In the guard of protecting their culture & traditions - roads were not made
        - Lack of min. wages despite Act , Higher wages promised by Naxals (by pressurising industrialists) gives legitimacy to LWE
        - Social- Untouchability,bondel labour- mixing of caste and class issues
    - Poor implementation of constitutional & legal provisions
        - Article 244/Schedule V _(UPSC Question 2013)_
            - Tribal Adv Council (TAC) either not formed or recomm. not implemented by Governor
            - TAC coopted in the system- more tribal injustice
            - Governor’s report never debated in Parliament- leading to substandard functioning
            - Sch gives power to Governor to make regulationto prevent land alienation; could not prevent land grab by non tribals
            - Lack of resources with Governor to oversee good governance, dev, protection of customs
            - Sch says minor minerals and minor forest produce can only be exploited by tribals - but this was still misused by non tribals — no benefit sharing
            - Sch gives power to regulate money lending — Still exploitation faced from money lenders and zamindars
        - PESA 1996: Could not prevent land alienation despite specific prov; issues in ident. of beneficiaries, permission from gram sabha
        - FRA 2006: Good start but over the years the provisions have been diluted; Unapproved claim rights are pending with state forest depts.
    - Difference in definition of development
        - Development for them means nothing if makes them alienated from their culture, tradition
        - Planning commision 2008-modernisation cause of alienation resulting in- “developemnet induced displacement”
        - Mining projects,irrigation projects - land alienation-dont want jobs but land
        - Creation of SEZ-land acq
    - Governance & Excessive Force Issues
        - Vacuum filed by Naxals using Kangaroo courts (but these inst. are highly corrrupt and minimal respect to tribal culture)
        - Corruption in basic welfare-PDS,MGNREGA
        - Dev Gaps used by Naxals: eg: development of own schools, hospitals
        - Vicious cycle of violence (b/w both states and LWE),Police force,rapes
        - Golden nexus b/w LWE, lower bureaucracy, political class
    - External, Internal support
        - Nepal,China funding by Maoist org
        - Collab with other anti state forces- eg ULFA taining maoists, JK radicals ,NE insurgents
- Measures Taken
    - National policy and Action plan for LWE- multiprong approch- dev+security+rights
    - Developmental front
        - NITI aayog aspirational districts prog- most backward gets funds for public infra,rural roads,school,drinkiong water etc

        - Providing income tax benefits for setting indus units in backward areas
        - Civil Action Prog (CAP) - funds to CAPF’s- for welfare activites(festival foods, community infra etc by them- bridge gap btw them, win hearts
        - Skill Development: ROSHNI under DAY-Grameen- skill dev for rural youth,ITI centres, _Choo lo Aasman Scheme_ by Chattisgarh
        - Educational: POTA cabin schools, schemes _Padhe Dantewada, Likhe Dantewada_
        - PESA- governance power to tribals
        - Forest rights act2006- Gram sabha for land acq, individual and community rights
        - Surrender schemes-Withdrawl of court cases,rehab- monthly stipend of 4k for 36 months etc
    - L&O Front
        - Police, public order state subjects but MHA complements through:
            - Security related expenditure scheme- training,operational needs of security forces (reimb of exp by CG to SG)
            - Special Infra scheme- for weapons,infra of forces
            - Scheme of fortified police stations
            - Bastariya Battalion
            - Media - countering propaganda machinery
            - Elite Naxal forces such as Grey Hounds of AP, Black Panther of Chattisgarh
            - SAMADHAN Doctrine 2017 (core std. to be appllied while dealing with conflicts)
- Critique of State approach to Naxalism
    - Excessive use of force → Counterproductive → impacts innocent citizens more(Make diagram)
    - Lack of coordination b/w states (Naxals due to AP greyhound operation ran to other states- new areas affected)
    - Blame game, political statements b/w C and S → Loss of credibility of govt.
- Way Forward
    - Developmental front
        - 2nd ARC 7th Report
            - Sincerity in implementation of Sch V, PESA, FRA eg: Oversight Committee to implement FRA
            - Avoid non tribal personnel in tribal areas (by using regional cadres)
            - Mobilizing NGO (acts as link b/w govt. and LWE)
            - Strengthing cooperatives using TRIFED support
        - Posting of highly motivated officers rather than punishment postings (incentise and reward)
        - Providing flexibility in schemes to allow dev based on local needs
        - Rehab of displaced communities; Use Brazil/Japan Equity model to provide coownership
        - Odisha govt. plans developments projects such as intergrated farming of turmeric for Swabiman Anchal (Naxal affected area near Malkangiri Distt.) _Use it as an example/best practice_
    - L&O Front
        - State police forces must locally recruit and train
        - Senitization of CAPF
        - TOI report- “Dieseas not maoist kill most crpf in red zone”
        - IPS heading CRPF cadres- lack of motivation
        - Choke funding
    - Others
        - Perception management to break propoganda machinery
        - Tech- NTRO- UAV, tech for mine detection,geo tagging of CRPF personnel
    - Good initative- IAS saurabh kumar lunch (with tribal youth) with collector initiative in naxal hit CG.

##### Insurgency in North East

- Northeast India has an extraordinarily important international strategic dimension and is a vital part of the nation’s defence architecture
- Disparity in development within the region- heterogeneity among the NE states, high level of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, religious diversity (ethinic hotspot)
- Conflicts- National(want sep homeland-Nagalim), Ethinic(assam bangla issue), Subregional(many tribals-many demands of state- gorkha-bodo)
- Current Status
    - Work in Progress
        - Nagaland
            - Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) has 2 factions NSCN (I-M) and NSCN (K)
            - Approach: Naga Peace Accord with NSCN (I-M) and Cracking down of NSCN (K)
            - Demands: Sep. const, Flag, Greater Nagalim
        - Manipur
            - Ethnic strife between hill tribes and valley areas → 40+ insurgent groups
        - Assam
            - Tripartitie Assam Accord with AASU, Gov of Assam, GOI
            - Cracking down ULFA - _Operation All Clear_ with Bhutan
            - 2nd ARC Given reasons why youth joining ULFA - Pg 163 of Report (discuss if it needs to written)
    - Success Stories
        - Mizoram
            - Accord with Mizo National Front in 1986 then statehood
            - Relative peace prevails
        - Tripura
            - Demographic Inversion from 70:30 to 30:70
            - First state where AFSPA was completely removed in 2015
        - Meghalaya
            - AFSPA withdrawn; Situation among control [Background was fighting with outsiders + within themselves (Garo v/s Khasis, Jaintia)]
        - Arunachal Pradesh
            - Facing spill over effects as noted by Standing Committee of RS but largely peaceful
- General Causes of Insurgency in NE
    - Historical
        - Treatment of buffer zone by britishers (loose administration) →

incomplete integration

- - - Do not share Indian national movement → No common past
    - Geographic
        - Terrain is conducive for insurgency eg: Guirella warfare
        - Porous border and misuse of existing provision eg: Free Movt. Regime
    - Economic
        - Highest unemployment rates despite highest rates of literacy in the country
        - Difficulty in building infrastructure → No modern indus → No jobs

→ Discontent among youth

- - Demographic/Social
        - Influx of outsiders/illegal migration → Eg: Tripura/Assam →

Identity crisis in hotspot of ethnic diversity

- - - Tagging them together as ‘North East’ → _homogenizing effect_ →

People are averse to such idea due to attachment to identity

- - Political
        - Constitutional provision not implemented in true spirit eg: Sch VI, Article 371
        - Sch VI Autonomous Councils ended up creating multiple power centers instead of bringing in a genuine process of democratisation in the region
        - Reorganisation of states ignored ethnic and cultural specificities
    - Administrative
        - Weak police machinery; Fund siphoned by cronies;
        - High handedness of army under the garb of AFSPA
    - International
        - Training camps and ideological support received from BG, Myanmar, Bhutan & China
    - Rise of OC
        - Drugs: Proximity to Golden Triangle is impacting NE region eg: Moreh in Manipur
        - Extortion, parallel govts, Arms trading
- Measures taken by the government
    - Creation of ADCs under Sch VI
    - North East Vision 2020: Plan for infra, eco dev, HRD; Union Cabinet approved the North-East Industrial Development Scheme (NEIDS) to incentivise new industrial units
    - Make in North-East: To promote exclusive North East expertise in areas like tea processing, organic farming, bamboo farming
    - Comprehensive surrender cum rehab scheme to bring back youth
    - Separate ministry (M/o DONER); Creation of NE Council
    - Financial support to startup and businesses via _North East Venture Fund_
    - International coop: Kaladan Project, Connectivity through BG, IMT Highway, Tourism, Coop with Japan
    - Development schemes: UDAN Scheme, Skill dev schemes such as PMKVY
- Way Forward
    - Political
        - Write basic way forward wrt law and order of LWE here
        - Political solutions to the Assam problem should be discussed- Respect their idenitity through NRC in Assam.
        - The Autonomous District Councils (ADC) should be able to function without state hindrance(eg conflict btw both in Meghalaya as full sate in 6th schedule) → act as micro democractic institutions
        - Cooperation with neighbours (Op Sunrise with Myanmar, Op All clear with Bhutan for ULFA), Joint trainng/mock excersise of forces, ensure insurgents dont get weapons from Bang,Myan FMR misuse control
        - Golden triangle- protect youth from drug culture
        - Gradual repealing of laws such as AFSPA to win ❤ and 🧠 of
    - Economic
        - Pragmatic land use policy should be formulated for attracting industries in the region, encourage MSME’s from NE- Focus on sectors such as organic agriculture, renewable energy, cottage industry, etc.
        - Local tourism should be promoted with special focus in Incredibe India campaign - ‘_Meghalaya half away to heaven campaign’_ - particularly eco-tourism and adventure tourism
        - Have adequate road, rail and air connectivity, waterways, internet connectivity and financial inclusion
        - Education centres for higher education - IIT, ITI, IIM
    - International
        - Development plan for the North-east should factor in India-ASEAN ties
        - To address the issue of inadequate connectivity in the NER, India could consider initiating a regional multi-modal transit agreement between the NER and the four neighbouring countries.
        - Government should focus on expediting projects, including the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project, the

India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway.

- - Administrative
        - Each state within the NER may be encouraged to draw up their development blueprint in consultation with the NITI Aayog and the North-East Council (NEC).
        - Different states in the NER have achieved success in different aspects of human development. DoNER should document best practices of the region (Sikkim) and disseminate its findings to others.
        - Water management is a major issue in the NER. Early completion of ongoing irrigation projects in Assam and Manipur under the AIBP, should be accorded high priority.
        - One of the most pressing issues hampering the progress of hydropower projects in the region is rehabilitation and resettlement (R&R). Attractive R&R packages should be devised for hydropower projects in the region
        - Better incentives and rewards for officers working insurgency affected areas
- Conclusion: Most of the armed insurgencies across the world do not end in either total victory or comprehensive defeat, but in a grey zone called ‘compromise’

##### AFSPA

2015: Human rights activists constantly highlight the view that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) is a draconian act leading to cases of human rights abuses by the security forces. What sections of AFSPA are opposed by the activists? Critically evaluate the requirement with reference to the view held by the Apex Court.

- AFSPA
    - Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958, grants extraordinary powers and immunity to the armed forces to bring back order in the disturbed areas.
    - AFSPA empowers the Governor of the State to issue an official notification declaring the state or a region within as a “disturbed area", after which the Centre can decide whether to send in armed forces.
    - Some of these extra-ordinary powers include Fire upon anyone after giving warning, Arrest anyone without warrant, Stop and search any vehicle or vessel and Armed forces personnel have legal immunity for their actions.
- Arguments for AFSPA
    - Tackle asymmetric warfare
    - Demoralising effect on the armed forces if removed.
    - Army require minimum safeguards from legal harassment
- Arguments against AFSPA
    - Abuse of power: fake encounters and sexual assault. Justice Santosh Hegde Committee (on fake encounters) call it “symbol of oppression”.
    - Terrorism: It has failed to contain terrorism ,number of armed groups has gone up after the act was established instead responsible for the spiralling violence in areas it is in force.
    - Threat to fundamental rights: it weakens democracy. Human rights violations in AFSPA areas are not inquired into -against the principle of natural justice.
    - Diminishing credibility of democracy: People’s disillusionment with democratic setup is exploited by secessionists- vicious circle
    - The decision of the government to declare a particular area disturbed cannot be challenged in a court of law.
    - The justice Jeevan Reddy committee recommended that it should be repealed and the Unlawful Activities Protection Act strengthened to fight militancy
- **Observations made by SC** - Inquire every death; Relook into section 6 of AFSPA
    - The Section 6 of AFSPA which precludes any prosecution, suit or legal proceeding against personnel of the security forces is no longer valid if the deaths of civilians are unjustified
    - Every death caused by the armed forces in a disturbed area, be it of a common person or a criminal, should be thoroughly enquired into
    - AFSPA should be only used to supplement the civil authority and not supplant the same by putting in place military administration.
- **Recommendations of the Reddy Committee** - Review after 6m + parliamentary approval; Grievance cells
    - The Union government may also deploy the armed forces without a request from the state. However, the situation should be reviewed after six months and Parliament’s approval should be sought for extending the deployment.
    - The Union government should set up an independent grievances cell in each district where the Act is in force
- Way ahead
    - Amending the AFSPA act to delist offences like sexual offence etc from it and trying them out using having a robust judicial mechanism
    - Proactive role by local government towards real development, especially in social sectors
    - Slowly phasing out AFSPA based on threat perception as rooting out AFSPA totally might create chaos

##### Linkage of Organised Crime with Terrorism

- **Meaning and characteristics**: Pursuance of criminal activity as a business; Features: Specialization, Strict membership, Continuity beyond lifetime of memb,Hierarchy
    - Examples
        - Trafficking in cultural property
        - Idenity related crime- selling DNA,data- Jamtara
        - Enviromental -poaching(Pangolins),illegal trade,illegal logging eg: Illegal Rosewood felling in Kerela, biopiracy
        - Organ trafficking,Cyber crime,piracy
        - Narco drugs(Golden triangle /crescent), Human trafficking,counterfietiing currency, gun running
        - Spot fixing in sports eg: IPL
        - **Sale of counterfeit health products (medicine/injections) during pandemic** (to counter this INTERPOL conducted Operation Pangea XIV, in which CBI was also involved)
- **Components**: (Write by making diag)
    - Criminal groups, Protectors (Buisnesman,politicians,bureaucrats),
    - Specialist support (OGW,shootersetc)
- Differences and similarities between the two
    - Similarities: Both run in enterprise format; Both use violent means; Both seen as criminal in eyes of law
    - Differences: Covered in table

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Basis**|**OC**|**Terrorism**|
|Aim|Monetary gains|Pol/Sovereign demands|
|Means|Less violent|Extreme violence|
|Media attention|Remain hidden|Want constant attention|
|R'ship with state|Indifferent|Wants to overthrow state|

- Linkages between them (acts as force multiplier)
    - Background:
        - UNSC in resolution 1373 (year 2001) noted close connection btw int terrorism and trans org crime
        - Example - Madrid bombing in spain- drug trafficking mafia became radiclised and carried out bombings (Narco-terrorism)
        - On a scale where degree of linkage increases from left to right
            - Coexistence → Cooperation → Confluence
    - Coexistence: No r’ship; No interaction b/w them but both benfit from weak state stucture, society depended on non state supplier, tolerace for illicit activity.
        - Not cooperate (and thus only coexist) in many cases to reduce risk of increased attention from law enforcement agencies
    - Cooperation: Coordination on the basis of quid-pro-quo

(customer-service provider r’ship)- both require false docs,IT specialists.

- - - Examples: OCs providing arms to TGs and inturn getting help in form of cross border movt, TG’s benefiting from OG’s contol on territory
        - Indian Examples: Mumbai Blasts (LeT and D-Company); Insurgent groups providing patronage to OCs
        - ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 8.jpeg>)
    - Confluence: One performing the funtion of the other
        - Examples: ISIS controlling oil wells; Taliban in poppy farming; Insurgent Groups of Nagaland involved in extortion,Madrid narco terrorism; Naxal Groups involved in drug trafficking , Dawood ibrahim gang both TG’s and narcotics trafficker.
            - OC’s using terror to protect biz intrests, TG’s getting funding for pol motives,
            - However chances of change in aims- TG’s neglecting pol goal for money.
- **Reasons for linkage**: Improving communication, globalization; Terror fin issues after 9/11; Both can thrive better in lawlessness
- Measures taken
    - India ratified UN convention against Trans org crime(UNTOC)2000-int coop,mutual legal assistance
    - Bilateral coop with like minded Countries
    - CCTNS- coord of police and other org for investigation
    - Institutional setup: NIA,ED,NCB,CBI
- Challenges faced to combat OCs
    - No central level legislation (legislation are there at state levels eg: MH Control of OC Act 1995); Also no comprehensive coverage in IPC
    - Glorification of OCs by media, cinema eg: Mirzapur web series
    - Difference in laws,definitions,evidence ruleds across the globe → OCs take advantage of this- also diff in INTERPOL co-rd
    - Neglect of forensic science graduates and infra such labs
    - Ineffective security agencies: Issues with equip, training, etc.
    - Slow pace of trials and conviction even after spcl courts
    - Golden nexus b/w politicians, businesses and bureaucrats
- Way Fwd/Suggestions
    - Specialized law to deal with OC (or Centre can bring model act)
    - Right portrayal by media
    - Universal adoption of UNTOC
    - Dedicated infra - Specialised cells, forensic labs
    - Financial system monitoring for suspicious activity
    - Coopearte with social media co. , Christchurch call of action
    - Research on T,OC, Training to enforcemnt agencies
    - Cross sectoral training of agencies- NCB-ED-NIA
    - Public awareness- stop youth alienation
    - WF of Border security
    - Tackle corruption among customs,border forces
- Terrorism has a come a long way from using sea route to attack Mumbai in 2008 to attacking air bases through drones in 2020. International cooperation & consensus are required to deal with this challenge and India must take active role in the process.

##### Border Security - Challenges, Management

- **Basics**: 15000 km of land border; 7500 km of coastal border; Marked by uneven geographical terrain (from deserts to high altitude mts. to swampy marshes & rivers);
    - ABV quote- _You can change frnds but not neighbours_ - Need for BM
    - India’s ISC (Int. Sec Challenges) are closely linked to BM eg: Militancy J&K, LWE, NE insurgency, OCs, Illegal migration, etc.
- **Border Security v/s Border Management**: BS only focuses on territorial security from hostile elements; BM is wider and includes BS along with PES (pol, eco, soc) dev of border areas and legitimate trade and cultural ties with bordering nations
- Challenges associated with BM in India
    - Man made artificial boundaries not based on natural features like river etc - therefore porous
    - Unsettled and disputed boundaries with neighbours eg: LAC issue China
    - Organised crime- HT, Terrorisim, Drug T, Arms trade, FICN (Nepal)
    - Use of sophesticated technology by perpetrators eg: **Drone** Attack on Jammu Air Force Station in **2021** (due to their size they escape military radars)
    - Multiple forces → Challenges of coordination,command and control
    - Diversion of forces for domestic L&O duties eg: BSF used in election (no time for rest & training)
    - Intel Issues: Lack of effective intelligence sharing particularly at field level; Poor intelligence collection
    - Galwan valley- Forces without arms due to int treaty backfired- 20 martyred
    - Smuggling - undergroud couriers operating
    - Illegal migration → Changes in demographic profile → Subversion of democratic process
    - IB Report - Funding of NGO by external actors to stall India’s developmental efforts
    - Inadequacy of basic infrastructure eg: ITBP personnel took 21 days to reach last patrolling point at Arunachal-China border on foot
- Measure Taken
    - Aim- Need for balancing hostile intrestes with legitimate trade at borders
    - Dept of Border Mgmt at MHA- implements Border area Dev prog(BADP)- fencing,floodlighting,roads,dev of ICP’s, welfare to locals on border
    - ICP’s- entry/exit points having all facilities of visa,commerce,border security,banking- managed by Land ports authority of india
    - Pilot projects undertaken under CIBMS
    - Operation Sadbhavna by Indian Army to win ❤ and 🧠 of (eg: sponsored higher education of 110 students of J&K and Ladakh)
- Solutions
    - Use of technology
        - Extension of CIBMS eg: BOLD-QIT by BSF (from pilot projects to larger scale); Also address training, HR issues, ground level infra needed for use of tech
        - Mobilisation of space assets to secure borders (dedicated satellite for M/o Home)
        - Eg: Sensors, aerial imagery, drones
        - Laser use on vulnerable stretches, GSAT 7,7A- dedicated military satellites ,IRNSS
        - Better weapons
    - Developmental measures
        - Involvement of local population (act as eyes and ears); BGF are seen as face of governance
        - Border Haats
        - Better edu,hospitals for local
    - Operational Issues
        - Tackle psychological stress using yoga/meditation, food, bad climate issues of forces
        - Maintain pay parity with Army forces doing the same border tasks
    - International co-op
        - Resolve difficult terrain conflicts- eg Siachen avalanche- K Hanumnthappa 2016
    - Recommedation of GOM report on Internal secrurity 2001 still relavant today:
        - Take up demarcation of borders(land and maritime) with China,Pakistan,Nepal
        - Border state represantion too for effective imp of BM
        - Not deploy Border forces for non-B works like elections,law and order etc(ITBP-spcl force should not be deployed in naxalite areas)
        - If border placed under army- ensure full autonomy
- Challenges from Pakistan
    - Export of terrorism; FICN; Drug trafficking eg: Udta Punjab (proximity with Golden crescent)
    - Frequent shelling and violation of cease fire;
    - Sir creek , Siachen issue
    - Difficult terrain -desert, mountains,glaciers
    - Internationalisation of Kashmir issue; Nexus with China - CPEC, designation of terrorists
    - Specific Initiatives- NSG training BSF for counter terror, Madhukar Gupta Committee (4 states bordering Pak req. diff security mechanisms due to diff in terrain; Need for laser walls in marshy plains)
- Challenges from Bangladesh (longest border)
    - Cattle trafficking (loss of revenue to GOI);
    - Heavily populated border- Illegal migration (demo profile change in Assam, Tripura);
    - Safe havens for groups such ULFA and NDFB; Growing radicalisation/fundamentalism (communal violence in Assam)
    - Specific Initiatives- BSF and BGB- both increasing awareness
- Challenges from Nepal
    - Source of FICN; Support of Maoist groups (training camps); Conduit of terrorists (used by ISI as per wikileaks); Smuggling; Radicalisation of youth
    - Kalapani issue- Lack of proper demarcation
    - Specific Initiatives- New SSB intelligence wing, dev aid to create employment in Nepal
    - Smuggling of liquor into dry state of Bihar
- Challenges from Myanmar
    - Misuse of ‘Free Movt. Regime’ providing safe havens for NE insurgents;
    - Narco trafficking (proximity with Golden triangle)
    - Other OC - Arms trade, extortion
    - Refugee crisis - Rohingyas
    - Forest terrain- difficult to guard
    - Specific initiatives- 13 new ICP’s
- Challenges from China
    - Confusion b/w McMohan Line and Johnson Line; Claim over Arunachal Pradesh
    - Undemarcated LAC- different interpretaions
    - Disparity in infrastructure development vis-a-vis China
    - Support to Naxalism - ‘Spring Thunder’ (ideological & resource suppport)

##### Maritime and Coastal Security

- - **Basics/Significance**: 7,500 km boundary; Indo-Pacific as new global pivot; >90% of trade and 2 mn sq km of EEZ; Strategic importance of Islands, sea lines of communications, string of pearls
        - _History of 21st century will be written on the oceans_
    - Issues/Vulnerabilities:
        - Maritime terrorism/Piracy & Robbery: Attack on ports and ships
        - Infiltration of migrants, refugee influx eg: Sir creek, from BG and Sri L
        - Arms,goods,drugs smuggling, Infiltration (26/11)
        - Need to protect vital industrial and defence installation on borders (eg ISRO launching sites)
        - Attacks on Indian fishermen eg: Italian marines case; Prob also near Sri L
        - Governance Issues:
            - Lack of coordination among 3 tiers as led by diff ministries and govts.
            - Below par state level monitoring
            - Discontent among fishing communities: (they can act as eyes and ears)
            - Poor training, Shortage of manpower, Infrastructure issues (due to land acq.)
            - Difficult terrain, seasonal weather patterns
    - Measures taken:
        - Coastal security scheme Phase 1- 2005- better patrolling,infra
        - National Committee for Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security (NCS MCS) headed by Cabinet Secretary coordinates all matters related to Maritime and Coastal Security
        - CSS Phase 2 after major learning after 26/11 led to formation of NIA, 3 Tier Security Grid, NC3I (National Command Control Communication and Intelligence System), more police stations, mandatory registration, color coding of fishing boats, installation of transponders,navigation system

##### Various Security Agencies & their Mandate

![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 9.jpeg>)Security Infrastructure in India

##### Police Reforms

- Enforcement of L&O
    - Defence Forces
    - State Police
    - CAPF
- Intelligence Agencies
    - IB
    - R&AW
    - NTRO
- Investigation
    - CBI
    - NIA

Issues Related to Functioning of Police

- **Political Criminalisation Nexus: Second Administrative Reforms Commission** (2007) has noted that the excessive power in the hands of police has been abused in the past by the political executive
    - This nexus interferes with professional decision-making by the police (e.g., regarding how to respond to law and order situations or how to conduct investigations)
- Structural Issues:
    - Colonial and archaic Indian Police Act 1861 (model police act adopted by various states but various provisions not followed properly)
    - Top & Bottom heavy: Skewed structure with less officers at middle level
- **An Overburdened Police Force:** State police forces had 24% vacancies (about 5.5 lakh vacancies) in January 2016. Hence, while the sanctioned police strength was 181 police per lakh persons in 2016, the actual strength was 137 police.(UN

-222 per lakh)

- - Individual-enormous workload and long working hours, stress issues(IPS suicide)
    - Diversion to VIP duties
    - Structural causes (overburdened, lack of resources), approval by popular culture (disha rape case) and political pressure have **valorised violence & torture**
    - State of Policing in India Report 2019 - **one in two police personnel do not get weekly offs**
- **Need to set Police accountability:** complaints of unwarranted arrests, unlawful searches, torture and custodial rapes.
    - Need of accountability of the police to the political executive, internal accountability to senior police officers, and independent police oversight authorities.
- **Lack of Resources:** CAG audits have found shortages in weaponry with state police forces.
    - Also, the Bureau of Police Research and Development has also noted a 30.5% deficiency in stock of required vehicles with the state forces
    - Further, funds dedicated to the modernisation of infrastructure are typically not utilised fully. For example, in 2015-16, only 14% of such funds were used by the states
    - Both the points together show lack of political will to revamp police machinery
- Adhoc recruitment & removal of police heads - unlike central forces (overall the selection process is opaque negating democractic acocuntability)
- Trust deficit, Poor self image; Citizen have negative perception about police- fear more than public service
- Fitness not like Western countries - Cant run
- HR violation (encounter killing, custodial violence); Rakshak-Bhakshak Syndrome
    - CJI N.V. Ramana said police stations pose the “highest threat” to human rights and dignity
- Weak criminal justice system
- Mindset issues - where police officers themselves feel its is nothing wrong to beat convicts to extract info (2019 survey by Common Cause & Lokniti)
- There is a paradox: Citizens no doubt demand newer crime control measures which will keep them safe. At the same time they resent productive and smarter police innovations in the field because of perceived danger to individual rights and privacy
- No coordinated database for tracking wanted criminals/persons domestically - in its absence criminals from one police jurisdiction melt into popu of other
    - There is a need for nationwide integrated database similar to Interpol Notices (that help track fugitives internationally); This is can be then shared with countries bilaterally & ultimately deter criminals hoodwinking the law

Way Forward

- Curbing Criminalisation of Politics**:** Need for laws which debars persons with serious criminal cases from entering the assemblies and the Parliament
- Focusing on psychological mindset aspect as well - (which is often ignored)
- Model Police Act suggested formation of State Police Boards/State Security Composition which will have Leader of opposition, independent members, civil society etc - **the Board** will play a role in shortlisiting and selection of candidates for police **chiefs** (rather than adhoc appointment/removal followed currently; Though boards have been formed by states but they are either not balanced in composition or do not meet regularly)
    - Best Practice of UK: The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act, 2011, introduced **public confirmation hearings** as an additional layer of check for the appointment of the heads of their police forces known as Chief Constables (this ensures transparency)
- Revamping Criminal Justice System: Malimath Committee recommendations for devising a national policy paper on the criminal justice system. Some of the key recommendations are as follows:
    - A complete revamp of the entire criminal procedure system.
    - Creation of a fund to compensate victims who turn hostile from the pressure of culprits.
- Independent Complaints Authority: Eg: Model Police Act, 2006 requires each state to set up an authority comprising retired High Court Judges, civil society members, retired police officers and public administrators from another state.
- Implementing the SCs directive in Prakash Singh case 2006 (SC had to step in as CG and SG due to lack of political will failed to implement recommendations of successive committees)
    - Two aims- Increase autonomy and Inc accountability
    - Police Estab Board - to manage transfers, posting, promotion, service matters
    - State Security Commision - prevent politicisation of police by state govt
    - PCA- citien complaints against police
    - ![GS3 InternalSecurity](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 InternalSecurity 10.jpeg>)
- Well trained analysts to analyse intelligence data, special police officers only for intelligence gathering
- Special anti- terror sqaud in metro within police

Steps taken: MoU between NATGRID and NCRB

(MoU will give grant to give NATGRID access to the **Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS)**database, a platform that links around 14,000 police stations)

- Climate Change & security (Statelessness for refugees, Food sec issues, reversing devt measures)

#### Role of Community Policing:

- - Building Trust and Engagement: Community policing aims to build trust

and positive relationships between police officers and local communities. It encourages officers to work closely with residents, community leaders, and stakeholders to address safety concerns collaboratively.

- - Preventive Approach: It emphasizes proactive crime prevention strategies through community engagement, problem- solving, and addressing underlying causes of crime such as poverty, unemployment, and social exclusion.
    - Enhancing Intelligence and Surveillance: Community policing leverages community members as sources of intelligence, aiding in surveillance and detection of criminal activities. This grassroots intelligence gathering complements traditional policing methods.

    - See how many parts it can be broken: You wrote positive role of dev intiatives, shortfall, concl (No way fwd, no manifestation, etc)
    - **Approach**: Introduce the answer by defining militancy. In the body, explain the **manifestation of militancyin J&K (stone pelting, youth radicalisation, targetted killings).** (both in half page) Next, discuss how

developmental initiatives can be an antidote to militancy (reduce trust deficit, Win H&Mind, Jobs, Social integration, G20 meeting). In the next part, suggest what factors are making development lacking to tackle militancy (twin threats, hybrid militants, Complex linkage drug smuggling, Secterian violence, soc media for terror funding).
