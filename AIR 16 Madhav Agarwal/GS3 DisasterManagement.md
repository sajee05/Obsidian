**Note:** These notes are the result of a group effort over the past few years. You'll find pink (or other coloured) highlights at the start of many topics—these usually mark key terms, definitions, quotes, etc., based on our memory cues at the time. While most content is updated, some sections—especially in **GS3**—may contain older material, so

do cross-check and update where needed. Don’t get confused by the highlights; use what’s useful and feel free to build your own notes from them.

To assist with updates, we’ve added a **Current Affairs & Value Addition** section at the end of the notes. It can help you **enrich your answers** and also serves as a reference on how to make concise, effective short notes.

            2. Types of Vulnerability:
                1. Physical V: Geographica proximity to the source and origin of D; Phy condition infra eg: Wooden homes;

Houses on steep slope

- - - - 1. Social V: Based on presence or absence of social barriers in a society eg: Women, disabled, elderly, children
                2. Economic V: Based on economic status of the people which determines the intensity of damage eg: poor leaving in lower lying areas (as safer homes are expensive)
                3. Env V:
                4. Attitudnal V:

            1. Mitigation: Involves measures for prevention and risk reduction
                1. Prevention: Involves all the measures required to prevent the occurence of D wherever it is possible eg: a better water mgmt system can prevent floods
                2. Risk Reduction: (reduce risk as every D may not be preventable) Involves capacity development and reduction of vulnerability; Can be done in 2 ways

Structural measures: Involves physical construction of barriers, EQ resistant bldgs, providing engineering solutions, etc.

Non-structural measures: Involves policy formulation, knowledge dev and research, building awareness eg: Forming National Building Code is non-structural where as actually building the infra is structural

- - - 1. Preparedness: (Even after all mitigation measures there are chances of disaster therefore we need preparedness; _‘Safety favours only those who are prepared’_) It involves:
                1. Formulation of emergency plans

- 1. Covered below

##### General Best Practices

- According to **Sendai framework,** every $1 spent in disaster risk reduction leads to gain of $7
- The **Pillow Case Project by Red Cross**: Education program for kids where they create their own emergency supply kit by packing essential items in a pillowcase illustrated with Disney characters
- **‘Protorodhi Bondhu’** a community based volunteer force of was roped by Assam State DMA to tackle crisis during floods and COVID-19 (Good for quoting as example)
- Using **Community Radios** to aid in **disaster risk reduction** (pre, during and post)especially when all other forms of communications are disrupted; There are 276 community radios in India
- _Gaon buras and Gaon Buris_ (Red Army) help people of North east during disasters and epidemics (Official age slab is 35-60 but often headed by 80 year old) - also helped during covid epidemic
- Kudumbshree Kerela - women group during floods
- Japan
    - EQ sensitive electricity breakers- automotically stop elec if tremor felt- prevent later fires
    - Evacuation drills in schools from Class 1, random drills by city admin
    - Underground flood tunnel in Tokyo city
- General Conclusion:
    - Disaster-proofing lives and dwellings warrants a multi-sectoral approach: to build sturdy homes of suitable design, create adequate disaster shelters, provide accurate early warnings, and ensure financial protection against calamities through insurance for property and assets
- Odisha evacuate 1.2 million people in 24 hours- award by UN glbal plat for DRR, Google CWC collab to give people idea of flood level in city
- Under Legal Service Authorities Act 1987, the victims of mass disaster, flood, drought, EQ, industrial disaster, etc. are eligible for free legal services (use this in answers to bring out Polity angle)
- ADB Report 2014 - India would suffer 1.8% of GDP annually by 2050 from climate related events
- As per Global Climate Risk Index 2021, India ranks the 7th worst hit country globally due to frequent occurence of extreme weather events

##### ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 5.jpeg>)Basic Concepts

- **Hazard**: A dangerous condition or event that has the **_potential_** for causing injury to life or damage to property or the environment
- **Disaster**: Derived from 2 words Dis (bad) + Aster (star) - Bad star
    - D is the disruption in the functioning of a community or a society **_causing widespeading_** eco, social, env losses which **exceeds the ability of affected society** to cope using its own resources (someone else has to come help)
    - Not all H are D eg: EQ happening in desert will not cause damage
- H v/s D
    - Threat of loss v/s Event of loss
    - Within capacity v/s Beyond the capacity
    - No Vulnerability v/s there is vulnerability
- **Vulnerability**: Eg: People of Japan are not vulnerable as they are so prepared
    - V is what converts H into a D
    - V is used in context to vulnerable species; House on flat slope is not prone to landslide vs house on slope is vulnerable
    - V is the **_characteristics of an area_** which makes it more likely to be damaged by the impact of H
    - The D is when a H meets V eg: EQ in a desert is not D as there is no vulnerability
    - Causes of Vulnerability:
        - Poverty, lack of info, lack of inst. support, lack of skills/training
        - Population expansion (forcing people to live in flood plains), Unplanned urbanization
        - Environmental degradation
        - Disabilities
    - Types of Vulnerability
        - Physical V: Geographica proximity to the source and origin of D; Phy condition infra eg: Wooden homes; Houses on steep slope
        - Social V: Based on presence or absence of social barriers in a society eg: Women, disabled, elderly, children
        - Economic V: Based on economic status of the people which determines the intensity of damage eg: poor leaving in lower lying areas (as safer homes are expensive)
        - Env V:
        - Attitudnal V:
    - Characteristics/ Indicators of Vulnerability
        - Physical Indicator such as location, geography, environment and condition of infra, etc
        - Social I such as social barriers, patriarchy, education, beliefs, coping strategies eg: Tribes in Nicobar survived Tsunami (imbibed in their culture)
        - Eco Indicators such as income levels. production, employment levels, insurance, etc.
        - Demographic Indicators such as population numbers, density, age structure, minorities, etc
- Capacity
- Health Indicators such as pattern of diseases, availability of health services, etc
- Communication I such as public edu, warning systems, media, etc
- Organisation I such as govt and NGO services, laws and policies, etc.
    - The resources, means and strengths which enable the community to prevent, mitigate, prepare for, withstand or quickly recover from a

_hazard_ (as capacity hai to it would remain a H and not turn into D)

- - Capacity Development involves:
        - Physical Capacity - eg: Better infra, better location, etc
        - Social Capacity - Communities capacity to reduce the social barriers such as gender gap
        - Economic Capacity - Inc the economic status of vulnerable sections
        - Organisational capacity - diff org & sectors and provision of legal framework
    - Components of Capacity Development (things to do to ⬆ capacity)
        - Training - Skill dev, Mock drills
        - Education - In schools, colleges
        - Research - for better tech and policies
        - Awareness - Knowledge & info via interactions
- Risk
    - R is the measure of expected losses
    - It is the **_probability_** of harmful consequences resulting from interactions between hazards and vulnerable conditions; It involves the **_measurement process_**
    - Risk depends on
        - Nature/strength of hazard
        - Vulnerability
        - Capacity
    - Formula for Risk = (H x V)/C
    - Risk reduction is ⬆ in the capacity and ⬇ the vulnerability
- Disaster Management Cycle
    - Earlier approach was reactive (focus on post disaster); Now has shifted to proactive (pre disaster focus) - UPSC 2020 Question
    - DM includes sum total of all activities/programs/measures which can be taken up _before, during and after a disaster_
    - Pre Disaster: These are the activities to reduce the losses to be caused by potential hazards; It involves 2 components
        - Mitigation: Involves measures for prevention and risk reduction
            - Prevention: Involves all the measures required to prevent the occurence of D wherever it is possible eg: a better water mgmt system can prevent floods
            - Risk Reduction: (reduce risk as every D may not be preventable) Involves capacity development and reduction of vulnerability; Can be done in 2 ways
                - Structural measures: Involves physical construction of barriers, EQ resistant bldgs, providing engineering solutions, etc.
                - Non-structural measures: Involves policy formulation, knowledge dev and research, building awareness eg: Forming National Building Code is non-structural where as actually building the infra is structural
        - Preparedness: (Even after all mitigation measures there are chances of disaster therefore we need preparedness) It involves:
            - Formulation of emergency plans
            - Development of warning systems
            - Maintenance of inventories
            - Construction of shelter homes
            - Conduct of mock drills
            - Training of personnel
    - During Disaster:
        - Response: Involves immediate action in case of D such as warning & forecasting, assembling at shelter homes, immediate relief, evacuation to safer places

##### DM in India & International Initiatives

- DM in India before 2005
    - _Evolved from activity based reactive set up to a proactive institutionalised structure_
    - _D were dealt in a response centric manner_
    - Focus on pre disaster stage came up during first world conference for natural disaster reduction at Yokohama 1994
    - 1999: Odisha Super cyclone
    - _High Powered Committee formed and recomm. proper legal framework, org structure → No action taken_
    - 2001: Bhuj EQ
    - _DM Division with hierarchy formed under Home Ministry_
    - 2004: Took huge Tsunami to bring legal structure
- National DM Act, 2005
    - Envisaged the creation of a three-tier structure

|District|DDMA|-||

- - 2 institutions under Home Minsitry
        - National Institute of DM (NIDM)
        - National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)
    - NDMA: Apex body for DM in India headed by PM. It is responsible for
        - Formulation of 3 things:
            - Policy, Plan, Guidelines related to DM
        - Implementation of above 3 things
        - Provide timely & effective response to disasters

##### General Framework for any disaster

As per the Disaster Management Plan, hazards/ disasters have following types based on origin:

- **GEO-PHYSICAL:** Geological processes/phenonmenon - when the static equilibrium is disturbed on the Earth; Example- Earthquake, volcanic eruption, mass movements of earth/landslide
- **HYDROLOGICAL:** Caused due to deviations in the normal water-cycle or the over-flowing of water bodies; Examples- floods, landslides, tsunamis, coastal erosion etc.
- **METEOROLOGICAL:** Caused by factors affecting the atmospheric processes for **short lived to meso scale**duration, extending from a few minutes to a few days
    - Example- cloud burst, cyclones, tornadoes, heat waves, cold waves, sandstorm etc.
    - Meteorological vs Climatological is the differences in duration/life of disaster
- **CLIMATOLOGICAL:** These are due to the seasonal climatic variability for

**long-lived** macro-scale process; Example- drought, famines, forest fires, glacial lake outburst caused flood (GLOF)

- **BIOLOGICAL:** Biological/ organic in origin; Epidemics, insect infestation, locust attacks, stampede (animal stampede)

**BROADER POINTS FOR DISASTERS** _(Use for generic question eg: Mountain ecosystem)_

- **CAUSES-** NATURAL- Earthquakes; MAN-MADE- Building artificial reservoirs;
- **AFFECTED REGIONS-** (Map) - _1 extra mark_
- **IMPACT OF DISASTER-** Ecological (vegetation, animals, forests eg: death of animals at zoo in Odisha), Economical (property, cattles, crope/agri, industries dependent on primary sector), Impact on life/health (life loss, diseases), Sociological (migration, inc social tension), Impact on infrastructure and communication
- **MANAGEMENT: Pre-** Mitigation- Prevention, Risk reduction (structural, non-structural), Preparedness; **During**- Response; **Post**- Recovery, Rehabilitation, Reconstruction
- Agency and ministry involved
- **CHALLENGES** (reasons why DM is not able to happen; analyse issues at pre, during, post level)
- **EXAMPLES OF INITIATIVES TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT**- schemes and

programmes to deal with disasters (collect state examples along with national)

##### Earthquakes

- Intro
    - Sudden shaking of Earth crust. Sudden impact which is impossible to predict precisely- highly destructive
    - 59% of landmass comes under moderate to very high intensity (Zone III to Zone V)
- **Causes**-movement along plate boundaries- stress in crust- energy released by fault rupture in the form of seismic waves
- NATURAL CAUSES:
    - PLATE MOVEMENTS (Crust + Upper Mantle = Lithosphere = Plate);
        - Convergence:
            - Continent-continent: Example- India and Eurasian plates; intermediate, shallow (only shallow and intermediate - no deep due to less subduction) EQs
            - Continent- ocean: Example- Pacific plate beneath the North and South American plates; deep, intermediate, shallow EQs (all 3 depths possible)
            - Ocean-Ocean: Eurasian plate's oceanic crust is converging beneath the Pacific plate's oceanic plate at/near Japan; deep, intermediate, shallow EQs (all 3 depths possible)
        - **Divergence:** Continent-continent- shallow depth EQ- Example- East African rift valley; Ocean-ocean: is shallow depth eg: at Mid oceanic ridges
        - **Transform:** Causes one of the most violent EQ (as it gets locked for a very long time => pent up energy- suddenly it snaps) Example- San Andreas fault; Shallow EQ
            - Types of EQs based on depth: Shallow (more dangerous), Intermediate, Deep
    - VOLCANIC ERUPTION: Causes vibration in the nearby region eg: Eg: Indonesia
    - LANDSLIDE OR MASS MOVEMENT
- ANTHROPOGENIC:
    - MINING: Due to being underground + if its unscientific mining
    - RIS (Reservoir Indused Seismicity); Rocks below the reservoir may not be able to contain pressure Eg: Koyna reservoir of Maharashtra
    - NUCLEAR BLASTS
- **Effects** (analyse each on PESTEL for more)
    - Primary- damage to infra,human loss
        - Pipelines,railway line damage, Dams damage can lead to floods
    - Secondary- fires,landslides,chemical spills,floods,tsunamis,avalanche
        - changes in river courses
    - Tertiary- Post trauma stress
- REGIONS AFFECTED
    - **EQ ZONES IN INDIA-** Divided on the basis of **intensity** of the EQ- 4 zones- Zone II- Zone V- There is no safe zone in India (map)
- ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 9.jpeg>)
- Zone V: Sri Nagar, Dharamshala HP, Nanda devi area, Nepal-Bihar Border, Whole NE region (due to syntaxial bend), Kutchh, A&N Islands
- Zone IV: Areas around the Zone V - Himalayas, Ganga plain (incl delhi), Northern GJ, Western MH
- Zone II: CG, Odisha, JH, RJ, MP, Plateau regions of KR, TG and Vidharba region of MH
- Zone III: Remaning areas
- For every EQ, magnitude (energy released) is same for all places where it is felt (as magnitude measues energy released which is same for all) but the intensity (impact) is diff for diff places
- Therefore, DM for EQs aim to control intensity of EQ (as magnitude is not under control)
- EARTHQUAKE MANAGEMENT- NDMA GUIDELINES (These are specific; Also write general guidelines based on DM Cycle) **6 PILLARS OF EQ MANAGEMENT** given by NDMA
- Developing new EQ resistant structures: All news bldgs as per National Building Code so that they withstand the EQ. Also involves R&D of technologies required for EQ resistant structures
- Selective seismic strengthening and Retrofitting of existing prority structure and life-line structure- i.e. modify the existing structures to make them EQ proof (Enforced via safety audit of existing bldgs by local govt. bodies) eg: Schools, hospitals, heritage bldgs, dams, reservoirs, parliament.
    - Why retrofit? Estimated that the cost of retrofitting would be around 5-10 per cent of the cost of new construction
- Regulation and enforcement-: Implementing the safety measures & building codes by the respective states govts.
    - Use indigenous knowldege of construction instead one size fits all
    - Eg: Bhongas in Kutch region, Ekra constuction made of bamboo in Assam
- Awareness and Preparedness- eg: dev of handbook on safety, short-films, vulnerability mapping at the local level, involvement of NGOs and community participation
    - As 80% search and rescue done by locals and our first responders
- Capacity development: R&D, training and education (make people about the strategy of DROP, COVER and HOLD when shaking is felt)
- Emergency Response: Should always be by the local admin, volunteer groups (as time is of the essence)
    - Other mitigation measures: (as not possible to prevent EQ, better stay prepared and mitigate)
        - International- CDRI, BIMSTEC mock DM excercises
            - CDRI: Body that will pool best practices and resources from around the world and allow countries to build

disaster-resilient Infrastructure (as countries try to provide immediate relief, but there is no focus on building

disaster-resilient Infrastructure)

- - - Higly advanced tech for EQ monitoring centers like the ones in Japan,USA , more centres like the one estb in Uttarakhand to disseminate early warning of estimated date of EQ.
        - The sites for all large dams and nuclear installations in the region need to be reevaluated from a seismic point of view
        - A SAARC seismological agency needs to be set up (to ensure concentrated approach)
        - Soil to be analysed before construction. Same EQ can feel different on good and weak soil (diagram)- need to avoid alluvial soilds of river plains

● ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 10.jpeg>)

- CHALLENGES IN DEALING WITH EARTHQUAKES
    - Cant accurately predict time of EQ
    - Inadequate enforcement of the national building code (NBC) eg: repeated building collapse in Eastern delhi region (laxmi nagar)
    - Absence of earthquake resistant structures and poor regulation by Municipality
    - Lack of adequate preparedness and response capacity
    - Absence of system of licensing engineers
    - Lack of formal training among professionals in earthquake resistant practices
- INTITATIVES
    - NBC- Guidelines for new construction activites
    - NATIONAL EARTHQUAKE RISK MITIGATION PROGRAMME: Centrally

Sponsored Scheme which is implemented by NDMA for capacity building and public awareness in Zone IV & Zone V areas

- - PREPARATION AND UPGRADATION OF EQ HAZARD MAPS
    - The Pillow Case Project by Red Cross: (can be used for other awarness initiatives)

##### Floods

- **Intro**- State of high water level along river channel/coast leading to inundation of land.
    - Over 40% of districts now show a swapping trend: flood prone areas are now becoming drought prone & vice versa
    - While the number of rainy days during monsoon have decreased,

**single-day extreme rainfall** events are increasing, leading to flooding.

- Causes:
    - Natural- Shallow river beds, 85% rains during SW monsoon, river course change, sedimentation deposition (siltation), cloud burst, tsunami, cyclone generated sea waves, climate change, increased glacial melting leading to GLOF
    - Anthro- Deforestation (reduces water percolation and retention), Badly planned drainage, International dimension- (China Siang), Dam mismanagement and issue of coordination btw states (Karnataka-Kerela), faulty irrigation practices (over irrigation leads to salinisation which leads to less percolation), Unplanned urban expansion, Dumping sewage in rivers, Growing age of the dams in India (they are becoming obsolete and their floors are accumulating silt/sediments)
- ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 1.png>)
- Diag- Also highlight urban flooding -Mumbai,Chennai,Hyd,Pune etc
- **FLOOD PRONE REGIONS**- 12% (~40mn hectares) of the land is flood prone in India out of 329 mn hectares(Rashtriya Barh Aayog) ; Regions along with

reasons

- - BRAHMAPUTRA AND BARAK BASIN
        - Causes- excessive monsoons, topography causes the upliftment of clouds and heavy precipitation, very high soil erosion due to younger sedimentary rocks causing siltation
        - Shifting in the river course- when the rivers enters the plains from the mountains (Brahmaputra Basin is completely plain)
        - Average annual loss due to flood in Assam is to the tune of Rs.

200.00 Crores.

- - - The Brahmaputra and Barak river systems which account for one-third of India’s run off, are highly prone to floods
    - GANGA BASIN: Flooding is majorly caused by the left bank tributaries (they come from the Himalayas); Reasons: Sudden increase during monsoons, river course shifting, example- Kosi river, deforestation
    - INDUS (PJ, HY areas): Lower trib of R, B and Sutlej; Faulty irrigation practices- caused salinization and water logging; Deforestation
    - PENINSULAR RIVERS: All of them are in the old stage; channels are rocky (unlike plain region in north and NE) - hence less flooding; Water availability is less; However sudden increase can lead to huge losses Eg: 2019 floods of KR, MH and Kerela
    - COASTAL REGIONS OF ODISHA, ANDHRA PRADESH AND TAMIL NADU-

Mainly due to cyclones and storm surges

- **FLOOD MANAGEMENT**- AS PER NDMA GUIDELINES
    - STRUCTURAL-
        - Construction of reservoirs- like Damodar River Project by DVC to control the flow of water
        - Construction of leevees/flood walls/embakements (Succesful case- Yamuna)
        - Dredging/ desilting the river
        - Afforestation
        - National River Linking; Diversion of flood waters
        - Bioswales are channels designed to concentrate and convey stormwater runoff while removing debris and pollution
    - NON-STRUCTURAL MEASURES-
        - Flood plain zoning (involves regulating land use; diagram),
        - Flood-proofing (eg: using anchors to lift foundation; leaving ground floor or lifting height of bldg; double storey building),
        - Integrated watershed development programme (to deal with issue of water availability/scarcity through water shed approach),
        - Emergency response, skill training of the people etc.
- Initiatives
    - Aapda Mitra Scheme: Centrally Sponsored Scheme which is implemented by NDMA focused on training volunteers in 30 most flood prone distt. of India
    - Draft River regulation zone- limit construc on flood plains,CRZ
    - Dam safety bill 2019
    - India-Water Resources Information System by CWC
    - North East Water Management Authority - apex authority for developing all projects related to hydropower, agriculture, biodiversity conservation, flood control, inland water transport, forestry, fishery, and eco-tourism in the Eight North Eastern States
    - Collaboration with other countries in releasing of waters downstreams (eg: with Bhutan, China)
- CHALLENGES
    - DATA- NON AVAILABILITY OF CONTOUR MAPS- We need to know the slopes and contours of the land- there is no such contour data available- reduced scope of flood-plain zoning
    - UNPLANNED URBANIZATION AND ENCROACHMENT OF FLOOD PLAINS-

For cultural, religious activities- where regulation and implementation is difficult

- - LACK OF AWARENESS- About safety and response eg: People unprepared during Karnataka floods
    - LACK OF FORECASTING AND WARNING SYSTEM
    - Current level of technology allows for a lead time of only 24 hours to the decision makers at local levels. We need to fully adopt 'Ensemble Flood Forecast' system (as used by USA, EU) which comes with a lead time of

7-10 days. (currently this is under testing stage by IMD)

- - Multiplicity of agencies: CWC needs data from IMD regarding rf, this process often leads to delays
- Way forward
    - National Water policy, 2012, recommends conducting morphological studies, based on which planning, execution and maintenance of revetments, spurs, embankments, etc. could be carried out.
    - o Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts.
    - • Incorporating storage space in the reservoirs as a preventive measure during the floods.
    - Central Water Commission (CWC) had circulated a Model Bill on Flood Plain Zoning to all the States in 1975 to guide of States for enactment of legislation in this regard

##### Urban Floods

- Urban flooding is the inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in densely populated urban areas, caused by intense rainfall (on impermeable surfaces) which overwhelms the capacity of drainage systems.
- increasingly common now as the changing weather pattern resulted in more high intensity rain in fewer rain days
- significantly different from rural flooding as urbanisation leads to developed catchments which increases the flood peaks from 1.8 to 8 times and flood volumes by up to 6 times
- Causes:
    - Meterological- write basic causes of floods
    - Anthropogenic
        - NO/ LOW PERCOLATION OF WATER: As it is covered with concrete- very less soil availability
        - URBAN HEAT ISLAND: Closely spaced buildings → heat gets trapped in between the buildings → Causes easy precipitation
        - ENCROACHMENT OF LAKES AND WETLANDS eg: Flooding in

Chennai, Bangalore

- - - IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF SEWAGE: impedes the regular flow of water during rains eg: Mumbai, Hyderabad (have century-old drainage system, covering only a small part of the core city)
        - LESS NUMBER OF TREES AND CUTTING DOWN OF TREES
        - Unplanned urban settlements without considering natural flow of water
        - Sudden release of water from dams located upstream of cities/towns - CAG Report said Chennai floods in 2015 are man-made as it involved release of excess water from

Chembarambakkam reservoir to Adayar river in an indiscriminate manner (also CWC norms not followed)

- - - Indiscriminate disposal of solid waste leading to blocked drainage systems
- **MANAGEMENT OF FLOODS**- AS PER THE _NDMA GUIDELINES_
- _Note: M/o Urban dev is the nodal agency for Urban Floods_
    - Real time data collection via Local Network Cells under IMD
    - Pre monsoon desilting of drains to be completed by March 31 every year
    - Construction of rain gardens to inc percolation
    - Rainwater harvesting to reduce the surface run-off (to store the water falling on roof of indv houses) - Very simple and quite effective when implemented on indv house level
    - Vulnerability and risk assessment with a multi hazard concept (so that topography and natural drainage is considered while expanding)
    - Capacity dev and risk assessment; Early warning systems; Training for emergency response
    - Urban drainage management: Smaller check dams, storage areas for excess areas
    - Storm water drainage system, removal of solid waste
    - Create an Urban Flooding Cell under the M/o Urban dev in each state
    - For effective management of floods, one need to understand whether a region is prone to tidal events at its coasts or extreme rainfall events
        - For tidal events: We need to build closure dams, tide breakers, storm-surge barriers
        - For rainfall events: We need to build rainwater storage structures, lakes, detention basins
    - Green Infrastructure such as Lakes and Bioswales must be developed by cities
- Other initiatives
    - Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) in coordination with Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai developed an Integrated Flood Warning System for Mumbai called ‘IFLOWS-Mumbai’
    - CFLOWS-Chennai - India’s first integrated coastal flood warning system
- Existing Challenges
    - Ignorance of maping and comprehensive risk assessment which inhibit effective policy approach
    - Disintegration of investments
    - Lack of consultation of stakeholders
- Way forward
    - Integrated approach should be adopted for sustainable urban planning by empowering and educating Urban Local Bodies in decision making and planning of flood mitigation infrastructure.
    - Vulnerability analyses and risk assessments should form part and parcel of city master plans.
    - Disabling encroachment in sensitive zones through robust anti-encroachment laws.

##### Cloud Burst

- Sudden downpour usually over 10 cm/hour average in a very small area (compared to some areas in RJ get 10 cm Rf in a _year_)
- Global warming effect- CB more likely
    - Eg: Mumbai 2005. Leh 2010, Kedarnath 2013
- **Formation of CB**: Very high convection (upward movement of air/air currents)

→ Convection is so strong that it is not allowing the clouds to precipitate as there continous upward movt.

- - Cumulonimbus clouds are forming at high speeds
    - If above thing happens in mountain valleys there is funnelling effect - which further increases the rate of convection
    - Once it reaches upper reaches of atmosphere → air becomes thinner → loses its capacity → sudden dropping of water like a soggy paper bag causing CB
- AREAS AFFECTED
    - **HIMALAYAS:** includes J&K, HP, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Northern WB (Darjeeling), the North-East - _except Assam_
    - **DESERT REGIONS-** Rajasthan and parts of MP (due to high level of moistures)
    - **MONSOON COASTS-** West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat
- PREPAREDNESS
    - Warning is difficult as it requires a very fine network of radars, which is very expensive
    - Need for better targeting by identifying areas showing symptoms of CB by IMD
    - Thus, preparedness is important (preparedness is same as for floods)

##### Drought

- Drought is a serious shortfall in the availability of water mainly but not exclusively due to deficiency of rains
- It results from a long period of dry weather and insufficient precipitation, which causes acute dry conditions
    - Crop failure leading to scarcity of food grains (akal), fodder (trinkal) and shortage of water (jalkal) and all the three together is called **Trikal**
- **NATURAL CAUSES** (all are factors that are affecting monsoons)
    - VARIATION IN MONSOONS: Delay in monsoons- 15 days delay causes huge disturbance; Variation in amount- even 10% variation is announced as a deficiency; Variation in regions- some areas receive fewer rains
    - EL-NINO- The chances of drought are more in an el-Nino year; El-Nino- the cyclic movement of air and water
    - MADEN JULIAN OSCILLATION- Negative phase of MJO = droughts (unlike stationary El-Nino, MJO is a moving thing in tropical region)
    - INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE- Sea-saw variations between the eastern and western parts of the Indian Ocean; Negative- bad for Indian monsoons
    - VARIATION IN GLOBAL CLIMATE- Due to climate change impacting patterns of monsoons
- **ANTHROPOGENIC CAUSES** (most imp as drought can be largely controlled)
    - MISMANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES:We have a good amount of water available in India- but unable to manage Example- excessive extraction of groundwater in comparison to recharge, faulty irrigation practices (eg: Sugarcane prod is Vidharba)
    - LAKES AND WETLAND DEGRADATION: We don’t have the capacity to hold excessive rain- we are unable to store the water (high surface runoff)
- HOW A DROUGHT IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TYPES OF DISASTERS
    - SLOW DISASTER- Drought is called a creeping disaster- it is very slow in onset; More than it affects the urban areas
        - _Note: Other slow onset disasters are climate change, desertification, soil degradation - For all these remember to highlight need to focus on ‘preventive measures’_
    - LONGER DURATION AND AFFECTS LARGER AREAS- Affects eople’s

livelihoods over a large area

- - DROUGHT MANAGEMENT- can prevent droughts
- **TYPES OF DROUGHTS**- [As per the National Commission on Agriculture]
    - METEOROLOGICAL DROUGHT: Significant decrease in normal precipitation
    - AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT: When the soil moisture and precipitation are inadequate to support healthy crop growth
    - HYDROLOGICAL DROUGHT: Depletion of surface and sub-surface (underground) water resources
- DECLARATION OF DROUGHT
    - Long term average is the average for the precipitation of the previous 50 years; If overall rainfall is within + and - 10% then = Normal rainfall
- ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 11.jpeg>)
- REGIONS AFFECTED BY DROUGHT
    - **EXTREME-** Most of Rajasthan to the west of Aravallis, Kutch in Gujarat
    - **SEVERE-** Eastern Rajasthan, Most of MP, Eastern Maharashtra ie. Vidarbha, southern parts of Jharkhand, Inner Karnataka and Telangana- Rayalseema, Northern TN
    - **MODERATE-** Northern Rajasthan, Haryana, Southern UP, Remaining parts of Gujarat & Maharashtra (except the high monsoon coastal part), TN, Karnataka
    - Rest all are normal/drought free
    - ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 12.jpeg>)
- MANAGEMENT OF DROUGHTS
    - RAIN-WATER HARVESTING AND CONSERVATION- Through collection and channelling of rainwater
    - SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE- growing coarse cereals, soil moisture

conservation, construction of check dams, ponds, choosing the crops depending on the rain availability

- - IDENTIFICATION OF GROUNDWATER POTENTIAL- Through aquifer

mapping, planning for interlinking of rivers

- - DRIP AND SPRINKLER IRRIGATION
    - DROUGHT PLANNING-Involving improving effectiveness of preparedness and response efforts
    - DROUGHT MONITORING- Involving continuous observation of rainfall, water in reservoirs and comparison with existing water needs
    - LIVELIHOOD PLANNING- Identifying of those livelihoods which are least affected by droughts such as cattle rearing etc.
    - CLOUD SEEDING- Was done in Karnataka; Not very successful due to lack of study of varied affecting factors
- Initiatives - DROUGHT CRISIS MANAGEMENT PLAN, 2015
    - Suggestions from NDMA to the states. It involves-
        - Providing employment through MGNREGA
        - Strengthening of PDS
        - Recharge of groundwater by building check dams
        - Farm loan waiver or arranging for crop loss compensation

##### COVID as a Disaster

COVID-19 is the first pan India biological disaster being handled by India , first time that a pandemic has been recognised as a ‘notified disaster’ in the country by MHA, DM Act invoked for the first time in India to impose lockdowns

Issues with Current Framework of COVID-19 Disaster Management

- Issues with legal framework: DM Act never meant to be a legal mechanism to control the otherwise functional state governments, confusion among the masses, especially the vulnerable population (migrants, slum dwellers etc about changing guidelines
- Over-centralisation of powers: A top-down approach adopted by the central government left states with no manoeuvring space that could be used to design and enforce lockdowns keeping cultural and social norms in mind.
- Management of a health crisis has become an issue of law and order: “lockdowns,” “curfews,” “fines” and “surveillance.”, police state instead of welfare state
- DM Act is not suitable to deal with fake news/false warning being spread through social media and internet as it was passed in 2005 and then social media had not been as accessible or as available as it is now
- Migrants issue has also exposed the lack of co- ordination between the Union and State governments.

Learnings from present management of COVID-19 disaster

- Inclusion of ‘Restriction’ and ‘Refrain’ in Disaster Management Strategy: Three ‘R’s of disaster management- ‘Rescue, Relief and Recovery’. Restriction- on people for acc DM laws, Refrain- awareness to curb fake news
- Ground Level Implementation and Federalism: Contrary to the centralised structure of DM Act, India’s disaster response must be decentralised. Varied capacity of different states necessitates a lot more agile and differential approach of disaster management.
- National and state political and administrative agencies should be more collaborative and consultative.
- Role of Courts: complaints of discrimination, police excesses, starvation, lack of medical aid etc. from various corners of the country. There is bar on jurisdiction of courts and there is no grievance redressal mechanism under DM Act-need for PIL,Special leave.

Disaster Management (DM) Act, 2005 used to tackle COVID

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) under the DM Act is the nodal central body for coordinating disaster management, with the Prime Minister as its Chairperson. The NDMA lays down policies, plans and guidelines for management of disaster.

The 2019 National Disaster Management Plan issued also deals extensively with Biological Disaster and Health Emergency. This is the broad legal framework within which activities to contain COVID-19 are being carried out by the Union and State governments.

##### Industrial Disaster

Styrene gas leaked from Vishakhapatnam based LG Polymers India

- Industrial disasters are large scale industrial accidents, large scale environmental pollution, and product injury cases that have the potential for killing, injuring or otherwise affecting large numbers of people and natural environment. eg Bhopal gas tragedy.
- According to the Labour and Employment Ministry, in three years (2014-2016), more than 3500 workers lost their lives while more than 50,000 were injured in accidents that occurred in factories.

**Reasons** for Industrial Disasters

Apart from natural reasons such as earthquake or a cyclone, major reasons for this can be following-

On Part of Industry

- A lot of chemical manufacturing is in the small and medium sectors, whose ability to invest in industrial and environmental safety as well as occupational health is limited.
- Increasing tendency to skip long-term training and skill development by resorting to casual labour in the operational area. Low Level of awareness of safe machinery, unsafe practices.
- Poor reporting systems add to the problem. Many accidents and deaths go unreported.

On part of Government

- Labour falls in the concurrent list- multiplicity of legislations and changing regulations from state to state often pose compliance problems.
- Relaxation of Industrial Regulations: For ease of doing business.
- Failure to stop encroachment: Urban populations have encroached on spaces that were originally demarcated for industry, including the buffer (and green) zones.
- Ensure Doctrine of Absolute Liability: This concept evolved in India after the case of M.C Mehta vs Union of India (1986)-enterprise owes an absolute duty to the community on account of hazardous nature of the activity

Legal Provisions related to Industrial Disasters

- Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986-Set discharge and product standards for restricting pollution and ambient air and water standards.
- Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989- Importer must furnish complete product safety information to the competent authority
- Chemical Accidents (Emergency, Planning, Preparedness and Response) Rules, 1996- Centre is required to constitute a central crisis group for management of chemical accidents; set up quick response mechanism termed as the crisis alert system. Each state is required to set up a crisis group and report on its work.
- Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991- Imposes liability on the owner of hazardous substance and requires the owner to compensate victims of accident. Mandates to take insurance.

Way Forward

National Disaster Management Plan-2019 suggests the following steps to prevent the Chemical (Industrial)

Disaster.

- Understanding the risk: It involves strengthening Information Systems, Monitoring, Research which include Zoning/ Mapping of industrial zones,understanding PESTEL vulnerability.
- Inter-Agency Coordination- seamless communication among central and state agencies to ensure quick, clear, effective dissemination of warnings, information, and data.
- Investing in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) – Multiple routes for reliable access and escape, Decontamination facilities.
- Investing in DRR – Non-Structural Measures - Formulate/ strengthen rules, norms, and laws such as factories rules. No human settlements in close proximity of hazardous industries, legal actions for noncompliance of Manufacture Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals (MSIHC) Rules, compensation to chemical accident victims.

##### Locust Attack

- 2020 - worst desert locust attack in 26 years.
- United Nations (UN) has also warned that armies of locusts swarming across continents pose a “severe risk” to India’s agriculture this year.

Reasons

- Favourable weather conditions: led to spread beyong Rajasthan to MP,Maha etc(unlike earlier)
- Indian Ocean Dipole: Rising temperatures due to global warming amplified IOD- Heavy rain triggers the growth of vegetation in arid areas where desert locusts can then grow and breed.
- Cyclones: The cyclonic storms transformed the empty desert tracts into large lakes providing damp soils where the locust swarms breed.
- Westerlies: The westerlies also brought with them several bouts of rainfall - more breeding and influenced movement.

Effects of locust attacks

- Crop damage: wiped out crops spread over 5,00,000 hectares in Rajasthan- threat to India's food security Allergies: Locust swarms often create allergens that aggravate allergies.
- Harmful pesticides for Locusts : toxic and high level of exposure to the pesticides may cause nausea, dizziness and even death. They can also impact soil fertility by altering the ecological balance.
- Air travel: Threat to aircraft especially in the critical landing and takeoff phase of the flight.
- Effect on trees: Locusts also destroy the forest and urban vegetation areas if they are unable to find the crops to feed.

Steps taken by India

- Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), under Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, is responsible for monitoring, survey and control of Desert Locust in Scheduled Desert Areas mainly in the States of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
- 200 Locust Circle Offices have been set up to conduct survey & control operations in coordination with District Administration and agriculture field machinery of affected States.
- The Centre has compensated some of the farmers who suffered losses from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) Fund.
- Hindustan Insecticides Limited - Domestic production of pesticide to control locusts along with providing to affected countries.

Way Forward

- Use of bio-pesticides:
- Cooperation from East African countries to South Asia inc Pak.

Active role of organisations:

- World Meteorological Organization’s role is to forecast the more immediate weather changes thatmay exacerbate the locusts’ attacks.
- Food and Agriculture Organisation has also laid out a standard operating procedure to deal with locust menace: Desert areas receiving rainfall are to be surveyed for live locus or their eggs

##### Landslide

- Movement of mass of rock, debris or earth downslope is called as landslide. It is a type of mass movement under the direct influence of gravity (reduction in structural control of land); May lead to flood if river channels are blocked by river diversion
- **Natural Causes**: EQ, Excess Rf, Cloud burst, Steep slopes
- **Anthropogenic Causes**: Shifting agriculture, Road construction w/o scientific retaining wall (dislodges the rock structure and changes the angle), Soil erosion, Unscientific expansion (using excessive dynamites in fragile himalays eg: recent Kinnaur landslide in HP)
- **Regions Affected**: ~15% of land area (India has the highest number of landslide deaths in the world)
    - VERY HIGH HAZARD REGION: Steeper regions of Himalayas in J&K, HP, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh
    - HIGH VULNERABILITY: The entire Himalayas and NE (except Assam as its plain region)
    - MODERATE VULNERABILITY: Shivalks, Aravallis, the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats
    - LOW VULNERABILITY: Trans-Himalayas, Laddakh, parts of NE
    - ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 13.jpeg>)
- Why Himalayas are more prone to landslides:(GS1 question 2016)
    - Natural Reasons:
        - Youngest fold mountains of the world
        - Tall and steep slopes(lead to fast debris flow) with more than 10 peaks > 8000 metre
        - Frequent occurence of EQs
        - Not stable yet as there is continous movt. of Eurasian and Indian plates (movt. of 5cm/year)
        - Excessive precipitation due to monsoon and western disturbance- cause surface and soil runoff- triggers landslides
        - Rivers are in youth stage causing high vertical erosion
    - Anthropogenic Reasons:
        - ⬆ Deforestation, Soil Erosion- holding capacity weakened
        - Encorachment for building roads, mining( blasting leads to sudden landslides), other infra uses heavy vehicles on fragile areas
        - Slash and burn agriculture
        - Unsustainable tourism practices
        - Study done in Kinnaur HP shows - tunnelling in mountain, excessive dynamites used in hydropower projects; Even the

afforestation efforts added issues such as inter-species conflicts, less than 10% survival rate leaving the whole ecosystem fragile

- - Compared to Western ghats(GS1 question 2013)
        - H technically unstable and young than WG, In Himalays presence of snow triggers movement induced landslides, loss of forest cover due to difficlut regulation of Himalayas, Hydroelectric proejcts related construction in H, steeper slopes than WG
- MITIGATION
- The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has released National Landslide Risk Management Strategy (NLRMS) (Mains 365 2020)
    - Hazard Zonation: Involves preparation & validation of land slide zoning mapping , making use of advanced state-of-the-art tools such as Unmanned AerialVehicle (UAV), very high-resolution Earth Observation (EO) data.
    - Land slide monitoring and early warning systems involving real time monitoring system for landslide prediction (inputs are rainfall, geological studies, whether water is getting collected in some areas, etc)
    - Preparation of mountain zone regulation and policies involving enforcement of building regulations and structural safety
    - Stabilisation & mitigation of landslides and creation of special purpose vehicle (SPV) for landslide management
    - Awareness program: Involving awareness generation and preparedness and to take preventive measures before disasters such as construction of retaining walls, correction of drainage pattern (letting it flow naturally)
    - Capacity building and training of vulnerable sections at grass root level
    - Other measures:
        - Terrace farming to replace Jhumm cultivation
        - Afforestation programmes
        - Retaining walls to be built on vulnerable mountain slopes
        - Arrangments for landslide insurance and compensation for losses

##### Cyclones

- It is a tropical weather system in which winds equal or exceed 64 kmph. It is an intense low pressure system associated with tropical regions (temperate cyclones are not very disastrous)
- While talking of cyclones, use terms such as gale winds, landfall, etc
- AFFECTED REGIONS
    - Generally BoB:Arabian Sea - Ration is 4:1 but in recent times more cyclones are coming up in AS
    - 5-6 cyclones form every year on an average
    - Cyclone seasons: Pre monsoon (May-June), Post monsoon (Oct-Nov)
    - **MOST AFFECTED:** WB, Odisha, Andhra P, TN, Pondicherry, Gujarat (overall all 13 states and UTs are prone)
        - is the most probable region from the Arabian Sea; Recurvature of cyclones affects other states
- **Causes**: Covered in geography
- **WARNING:** India has one of the best systems spearheaded by IMD. The tracking is done through on INSAT satellites. Warning information spread through various channels of media, SMS to fishermen and general public.
    - But the accurate _landfall prediction_ can be given only few priors
- **MITIGATION METHODS**: as per NDMA guidelines
    - HAZARD MAPPING: of vulnerable regions and estimate the severity of damage using meterological records of wind speed & direction
    - LAND-USE CONTROL: involves regulation of land use and enforcement of building codes
    - ENGINEERED STRUCTURES: To withstand wind force and flood damage. Also constuction of shelter homes, coastal plantation through green belt as a wide buffer zone; Building the communication lines underground
    - FLOOD MANAGEMENT: discussed above
    - IMPROVING THE VEGETATION COVER: at coastal and around settlement to break wind speeds
- Initiatives
    - National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project: It is a Centrally Sponsored States supporting all the coastal states. It aims to support in risk mitgation, last mile connectivity, dev of cyclone shelters, roads/bridges to habitations, etc
    - IMD uses **Doppler weather radars (DWR)** which **send radio waves** to gauze size and speed of moving water droplets; IMD also collabs with other agencies such as of **Japan, USA** (Success of IMD to forecast helps in reducing loss of life)
    - 5-stage classification by IMD for cyclones which start from cyclonic storm and ends at super cyclonic storm (> than 222 kmph)
    - India one of the best cyclone warning systems- IMD through INSAT
    - West Bengal launched a project to plant 5 crore mangrove trees in cyclone-hit Sundarbans

##### Tsunami

- A Japanese word for ‘harbour waves’
- Natural Causes: EQ along the normal and reverse fault not along the transform fault; Marine volcanoes, Landslides (quite possible in Indian scenario due to huge sediment deposition by eastern flowing rivers in BoB)
- **Regions affected**: Eastern coast is more prone due to location of trenches such as Java, Sunda
- Total of 13 Tsunamis but data is not recorded properly
- **WARNING:** Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre managed by INCOIS (Indian Nat. centre for Ocean Information services), Hyderabad which gives warning for India and other countries in the Indian Ocean. It is capable of detecting Tsunami within 10 minutes for any EQ of magnitude 4 and above
    - ITEWC is declared as Regional Service Provider for IOR by the UNESCO
    - It uses network of seismic stations, sea level gauge stations, etc.
- MANAGEMENT AS PER THE NDMA GUIDELINES
    - TSUNAMI RISK ASSESSMENT AND VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS: Based on

coastal land use maps and coastal bathymetry (bathymetry to study the depth)

- - TSUNAMI PREPAREDNESS: through establishment of real-time seismic monitoring network(RTSMN); Role of media; ‘Tsunami Escape’ direction signs boards must be established
    - Structural mitigation measures such as construction of submerged sand barriers, backwaters, construction of bio-shields (planation of mangroves), Dev of break waters, sea walls and coral reefs, Dev a network of local knowledge centres
        - _Mangroves of West Bengal saved the state from being largely impacted by the Cyclone Bulbul_
- ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 14.jpeg>)
    - REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF TECHNO-LEGAL REGIME:

Implement the Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) strictly

- - EMERGENCY TSUNAMI RESPONSE involving public-awareness campaigns & voluntary organisations to ensure affective search and resuce operations

##### Heat Waves

- **Meaning**: A heat wave is a period of **abnormally high temperatures,** more than the normal maximum temperature. Heat waves typically occur **between March and June,** and in some rare cases even extend till July.
- How do heat waves occur?
    - Heat waves occur when a ridge of high pressure sits over a region for an extended period of time, bringing down dry, hot air to the ground. As the air sinks, it warms and compresses and it becomes very hot by the time it reaches the surface
- ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 15.jpeg>)Criteria
- Mitigation: as per NDMA
    - Government Engagement: Mandating participation of all levels of govt.
    - Appointing State Nodal Agency and Officer
    - Drafting and developing Heat Action plan: The State Nodal Officer can coordinate with local IMD office to start receiving summer season forecasts and release early warning and daily alert system with colour codes
    - Strategies for reducing extreme heat exposures and adapting to climate change (Long Term): States should consider mitigation strategies, such as increasing green cover, cool roofs, etc
    - Evaluating and Updating the plan after every hot season
- Others:
    - Public awareness through SEWA, ASHA workers
    - Build on the “Green Cover” activity to establish tree-plantation campaign in hotspot areas

##### Wild Forest Fires

- Stats:
    - **1/5th of Forest** are prone to **fire** says Forest Survey Report
    - With at least one in four people dependent on forests for their livelihood, India is losing at least ₹1,100 crore due to forest fires every year, says a new World Bank report
    - eg: Fire at Bandipur Reserve in 2019
- Reasons:
    - Manmade: Inflammable materials left behind such as burning bidis and cig, slash-and-burn cultivation (major reason for forest fires in north-east India)
    - Natural: Thunderstorm
        - The dry deciduous forests in central and southern India face 5 to 6 months of dry period and are vulnerable to fires
- India’s Initiative
    - National Action Plan on Forest Fires (NAPFF):
        - It was launched in 2018 to minimise forest fires by enhancing capabilities of forest personnel and institutions in fighting fires and swift recovery subsequent to fire incidents
    - Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme (FPM):
        - FPM is the only centrally funded program specifically dedicated to assist the states in dealing with forest fires
        - Nodal officers for forest fire prevention and control have been appointed in each state
- International Efforts:
    - When a fire anywhere in the world is detected by NASA’s MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), the Forest Survey of India (FSI) analyses the data and pinpoints the location to the exact forest compartment
    - The Sentinel-3 World Fires Atlas Prototype product has been developed by European Space Agency
    - Mobile hospital initiative by Australia to treat animals affected by bushfires; Same model can be adopted by India for human-wildlife conflicts
- **Way Forward**: Tackling forest fires is even more important in India as the country has committed to bringing 33% of its geographical area under forest cover by 2030, as part of NDCs

##### Community based DM/ Role of Media

- Community is the first line of responders. They possess traditional knowledge to deal with the disaster. They are better connected with ground level details
- **Pre Disaster**: Role played in location specific training, awareness generation, risk assessment using traditional knowledge based inputs, Formulation of emergency plans, Conduct of mock drills, Maintenance of inventories
- **During Disaster**: Volunteer groups and community can allow for evacuation to safer places based on warning received. Taking all the vulnerable sections along. Coordinating with media
- **Post Disaster**: Collection & distribution of relief supplies; Accurate damage assessment, Psychological support to affected people, Controlling anti-social elements
- _On the same lines role of media for DM can be written_
    - Main role is to provide accurate and factual details without exaggeration
    - Countering -ve reporting & propoganda by vested interests
    - Pressurising the govt. towards DRR in some specific area

## Current Updates and Value Additions

#### Short Notes on Committees:

- - NCRWC-7th sch, Joshimath (Mahesh Ch Mishra Cmt), Himalayas (Ravi

Chopra Cmt), PK Mishra Task Force (said to Restructure NDMA, dissolve NEC, Increase financial resources); CAG Report (Vacancies are there in NDMA Advisory Committee; Many projects stopped midway due to poor planning; Top down approach-leading to minimal role of NGOs/CSO);

- - **World Bank’s EPIC Response** Framework: **E**WS, **P**reparedness, **I**ncident response, **C**ompensation
    - **Aapda Mitra Initiative** is to train 1 lac volunteers in 350 dist prone to LS, cyclone, EQ, floods, etc
    - **LS Waynad**: Due to sand quarrying, faulty construction, deforestation & road bldg; **Gadgil Cmt had warned** the dangers of Waynad if road construction and settlement continue at same space
- **Map** banaya toh **1 mark** extra

#### Data:

- - Cloud Burst 10cm/hr;
    - Forest Fire - 1/5th forest;
    - EQ 59% (in IV, V),
    - Flood 12%,
    - Droughts 68%,
    - Cyclone 5700 out of 7500km, 4:1 Ratio of BoB:AS
    - As per UN, suffered eco losses $80bn in 20 yrs between 1998-2017;

#### Generic Points:

- - **Use terms**: EWS, Hazard zonation (via EO satellite, drones), Contingency

planning, Quote govt schemes (eg: Jal Shakti Abhiyaan or National Watershed Project in droughts); Role of NGOs - Kudumbashree - work

with rural communities to promote livelihood diversification; Anthropogenic reasons for disasters mein **DUMA short form mat bhulna + Industrialisation + causes of disaster are linked (quote one in other -** eg: EQ → LS; Inc Rf → CB, LS, GLOF)

- - Evolution: Hyogo 2005 - DM Act 2005 - DM Policy 2009 - Sendai F - DM Plan 2016 (isme phir areas aaye na) - DM Plan 2019 (climate wala)
    - **Impact of any disaster:** On human (health, migration, diseases, etc), on economy (trade, agri productivity), on flora/fauna/fungi, On critical infra/security risks
    - **Lessons ya measures to take aaye:** So breakdown into Preparedness, Mitigation, Response, Rehabilitation (use key terms), EIA, Construction of eco-passages to safeguard flora/fauna
    - DM Cycle banao short mein answer mein - Pre, During and Post
        - **Pre-Disaster** =Prevention, Risk Reduction (S & Non-St) Preparedness 'Safety favours only those who are prepared' **During Disaster** = Response **Post Disaster** = Recovery, Rehabilitation, Reconstruction
    - Make formula: Risk = (Hazard x Vulnerability)/Capacity
        - Hazard = pontential, Vulnerability = characteristics; V is what converts H into disaster

#### Joshimath Land Subsidence

- ![GS3 DisasterManagement](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/GS3 DisasterManagement 16.jpeg>)

#### Conclusions:

- - **Can quote recent incidents in conclusion** and say we must ensure they

do not get repeated eg: Bhopal Gas tragedy (hazardous wastes)

- - India has established the first G20 Disaster Risk Reduction Working Group
    - Goal of the **UN Secretary General’s Early Warnings for All Initiative,** which **seeks to create universal coverage** for everyone by the end of **2027**
    - India recognised as **Champion for DRR**; As per **Sendai**, **$1** in DRR leads to gain of **$7**
    - **National Policy on DM 2009** - guides us to mainstream dis mgmt in dev proces and see reconstruction as an opportunity

#### Marine Heat Waves:

- - Seawater temperatures exceed a seasonally-varying threshold **higher by**

3-4 degree for at least 5 consecutive days

- - **Factors**: **El-Nino**, **Ocean current** (build **areas of warm** water); Global warming (Ocean absorb 90% GHG); **Geog factors (reduced wind flow** that affect heat release via evaporation)
    - **Effects**: Marine ecosystem, **Algal bloom**, Coral bleaching, Fishing impact as sea grass/kelp destroyed; **Monsoon affected**; **Tourism** affected; **Blug flag beach;**
    - Conclusion: SDG 14, CRZ Norms, UNCLOS

#### Heat waves:

- - The India Meteorological Department (IMD) declares a **heatwave** when

**temperatures exceed** 40°C in plains, **37°C** in coastal areas, and **30°C** in hilly regions.

- - **IMD** should **integrate wet bulb temperature measurements** into heatwave **declarations** (Wet bulb temperature, which **considers both temperature and humidity**, can better represent the actual heat stress on the human body) + Develop **heat action plans** considering humid heatwaves and enhance public awareness; **Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan as best practice**
    - **Heat waves**: Cool roofs, Green cover, Heat Action Plans, Not a disaster as per DM Act 2005

#### CDRI

- - For Jt. Operation, Funds, Deputation of International Experts,

Coordination as global nature of cyclone eg; Cyclone Vayu from Arabian Sea near Oman

#### Fire Safety Measures:
