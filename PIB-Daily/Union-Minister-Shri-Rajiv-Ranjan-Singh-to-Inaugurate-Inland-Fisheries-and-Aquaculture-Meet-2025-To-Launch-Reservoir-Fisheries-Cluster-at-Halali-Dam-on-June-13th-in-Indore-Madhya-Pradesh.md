## Union Minister Shri Rajiv Ranjan Singh to Inaugurate Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Meet 2025; To Launch Reservoir Fisheries Cluster at Halali Dam on June 13th in Indore, Madhya Pradesh

### Inland Fisheries Hit 147 Lakh Ton in 2024-25, Register 140% Growth Over a Decade

The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying is organizing an “Inland Fisheries & Aquaculture Meet 2025” focused on development of Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture on13thJune 2025atIndore, Madhya Pradesh.The meet will be chaired by Union Minister, Shri Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying (MoFAH&D) in the gracious presence of Dr. Mohan Yadav, Chief Minister, Madhya Pradesh, Prof. S.P. Singh Baghel, Minister of State, MoFAH&D and Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Shri George Kurian, Minister of State, MoFAH&D and Ministry of Minority Affairs. On this occasion,Union Minister Shri Rajiv Ranjan Singh will inaugurate and lay the foundation stone for key fisheries projects for 7 Inland states and UTs with a total outlay of Rs.52 crores under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY). This includes the launch of the Reservoir Fisheries Cluster at Halali Damand the foundation stone laying of other PMMSY-supported projects, aimed at enhancing aquaculture infrastructure, boosting fish production, and generating livelihood opportunities across the inland regions.

Certificates will also be distributed by the Union Minister to the beneficiaries including fisheries Cooperatives, FFPOs and Fisheries Start-ups. Fishers will be awarded Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) and aquaculture insurance as well aimed at targeted insurance coverage, integrated digital access, and focused support for marginalized communities. Technical sessions will focus on key areas such as reservoir leasing policies, sustainable riverine and wetland fisheries, strengthening input supply, and unlocking the potential of cold-water fisheries.

The event will witness participation from fisheries ministers of inland states/UTs along with officials from the Department of Fisheries, State Fisheries Departments and ICAR Institutes. The event will be conducted in hybrid mode. This meet will serve as a vital platform for addressing region-specific challenges, promoting modern, eco-friendly approaches tailored to inland ecosystems, and enhancing livelihood opportunities, productivity, and long-term economic development in the fisheries sector.

Since 2015, the Government has made a cumulative investment of ₹38,572 crore under various flagship programmes to strengthen the fisheries sector.As a result, India’s annual fish production has witnessed a significant growth of 104%, rising from 95.79 lakh tonnes in FY 2013-14 to 195 lakh tonnes in FY 2024-25.Inland fisheries and aquaculture have emerged as key contributors, accounting for over 75% of the total production.This segment alone recorded a remarkable 140% increase, reaching 147.37 lakh tonnes in 2024–25, reflecting the enhanced utilisation of the country’s inland resources.

Inland fisheries and aquaculture involve catching and farming fish in freshwater and brackish water bodies like rivers, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. While inland fisheries harvest fish from naturally available species in fresh and brackish water, aquaculture uses controlled methods of fish farming such as pond and cage culture, along with technologies like Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS) and Biofloc. Inland fisheries and aquaculture offer year-round production, greater control over inputs and outputs, and better suitability for small-scale farmers. They also offer the unique advantage of bringing underutilised or unproductive ponds and saline affected lands into productive use, effectively turning ‘waste land’ into ‘wealth land’ while generating income and livelihoods, especially in rural areas. With support from 8 ICAR fisheries institutes, 4 fisheries subordinate offices and fisheries universities technology has become pivotal to the growth of inland fisheries and aquaculture. Under PMMSY and the Blue Revolution, 45,000 units—including RAS, cages, Biofloc systems, and raceways—have been approved across inland states and UTs boosting productivity up to 20-fold. A pilot with ICAR-CIFRI is also launched to explore drone technology for fish transport, monitoring, and sustainable management.
