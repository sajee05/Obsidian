## Raksha Rajya Mantri Interacts with NCC Mount Everest Expedition Team after their Successful Summit

Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Sanjay Seth interacted with the National Cadet Corps (NCC) Mount Everest Expedition team in New Delhi on June 11, 2025, after the team successfully scaled Mount Everest on May 18, 2025. During the interaction, the cadets shared their experiences from the expedition, highlighting the planning, training and challenges faced during the climb. Shri Sanjay Seth lauded the efforts and teamwork of the cadets for their incredible feat.

The feat marked the third successful Everest expedition by the NCC, following similar accomplishments in 2013 and 2016. The expedition team comprised ten cadets, five boys and five girls, with an average age of just 19 years, many of whom were novice climbers. They were supported by a contingent of officers, junior commissioned officers, instructors and non-commissioned officers, making it a well-coordinated and professionally managed mission. The expedition was flagged-off by Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh from New Delhi on April 03, 2025
