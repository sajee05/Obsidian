As part of the ongoing Viksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan, Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, visited Tigipur village on the outskirts of Delhi today. He was accompanied by Dr. M. L. Jat, Secretary (DARE) and Director General (ICAR), along with other senior officials and agricultural scientists.

This visit marked a significant initiative aimed at understanding farmers’ concerns, fostering direct engagement between farmers and scientists, and accelerating the adoption of modern agricultural technologies.

Shri Chouhan began the visit by participating in a Kisan Chaupal, where he interacted with farmers on key topics including seed production, polyhouse farming, strawberry cultivation, and the growing of other high-value crops. Commending the innovative approaches adopted by several farmers, he noted that such progressive individuals are at the forefront of transforming Indian agriculture.

The Minister also witnessed a live demonstration of drone technology, showcasing advanced techniques for spraying pesticides and nutrients. He spoke with the scientists regarding the cost-efficiency, scalability, and field-level application of these technologies. Later, he conducted a walk-through of a local nursery, interacting further with farmers and gaining insights into their practices.

Addressing the gathering, Shri Chouhan stated that the agricultural research will no longer remain confined to closed rooms. It will take place in the fields, in close collaboration with farmers. The feedback collected from villages by scientists will form the bedrock of future agricultural policy.”

He shared that in the past 15 days alone, 2,170 ICAR teams have engaged with the farmers nationwide, spreading awareness about research and new technologies. Based on this feedback, several challenges faced by farmers have already been addressed, with ongoing efforts focused on more comprehensive solutions.

Expressing concern over declining soil fertility, he urged farmers to get the soil tested and select crops based on the Soil Health Card. This is the foundation of sustainable agriculture, he added”

Highlighting the government's priorities, Shri Chouhan emphasized a renewed focus on crop diversification, market-oriented farming, and horticulture-based models. He accentuated that areas like Delhi, with their strong market linkages, hold great potential to become horticulture hubs.

He further stressed:

“In today’s competitive environment, farming cannot thrive without technology. Whether in cultivation or marketing, farmers must adopt technological solutions. The Central Government is fully committed to supporting them at every stage.”

Shri Chouhan also acknowledged that Delhi’s farmers had long remained outside the ambit of several central agricultural schemes, but assured that this situation is set to change.

“Delhi’s farmers will now play a key role in building an Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) and benefit from every Central Government scheme,” he affirmed.

He listed several major schemes to be implemented in Delhi, including:

PM-AASHA (Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan)

Price Support Scheme (PSS)

Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS)

Market Intervention Scheme (MIS)

Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)

Subsidies for polyhouses and greenhouses

Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana

Schemes for new orchard development, rejuvenation of old orchards, establishment of nurseries, agricultural machinery subsidies, and the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (crop insurance)

The Minister informed that the Delhi Government has been requested to submit proposals for the implementation of these schemes. The Centre will also extend support in setting up electronic weighing scales and facilitating fertilizer procurement.

“Our farmers fill the nation’s granaries with their sweat and toil. We will leave no stone unturned in securing their prosperity,” he added.

The Minister also reiterated his government’s zero-tolerance stance against the production and sale of spurious pesticides and fertilizers, stating:

“Those who cheat or exploit farmers will not be spared. The government is preparing to introduce stringent legislation to deal with such offenses.”

Concluding his address, Shri Chouhan said:

“Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, we are committed to transforming both the destiny and the landscape of Delhi’s farmers.”

The 15-day ‘Viksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan’ will culminate tomorrow in Bardoli, Gujarat, where Shri Chouhan will address farmers at the final event following his nationwide tour. To date, 2,170 teams of scientists have reached out to and interacted with nearly 1.08 crore farmers across the country through t

his campaign.
