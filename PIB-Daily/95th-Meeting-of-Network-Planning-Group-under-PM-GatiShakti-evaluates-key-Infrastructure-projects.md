## 95th Meeting of Network Planning Group under PM GatiShakti evaluates key Infrastructure projects

### NPG evaluates Metro Rail, Road, and Logistics Park Projects

The 95thmeeting of the Network Planning Group (NPG) was convened today to evaluate infrastructure projects in the Metro Rail and Roads, Transport & Highways and Logistics Parks. The meeting focused on enhancing multimodal connectivity and logistics efficiency in alignment with the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP).

The NPG evaluated five projects (1 - Metro Rail Project and 2  Road & 2 Logistics Parks) for their conformity to the PM GatiShakti principles of integrated multimodal infrastructure, last-mile connectivity to economic and social nodes and intermodal coordination. These initiatives are expected to boost logistics efficiency, reduce travel times, and deliver significant socio-economic benefits across regions. The evaluation and anticipated impacts of these projects are detailed below:

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affair (MoHUA)

Ahmedabad Metro Rail Project Phase-2A(Metro connectivity to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport)

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA has proposed the plans to extend the Ahmedabad Metro by 6.032 km to provide direct connectivity to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport from Koteshwar Metro Station (excluding). This strategic extension is poised to significantly enhance urban mobility by offering faster, more convenient access to the airport for daily commuters, airport personnel, and residents across the city. The project will not only improve airport accessibility but also contribute to a more integrated and efficient intra-city transit system in Ahmedabad. Designed to support the city’s long-term mobility needs, the corridor aims to reduce travel time, ease congestion, and promote the use of public transport. The planning process has involved close collaboration with key stakeholders, including the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport Authority (SVPIA), Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA), Ministry of Defence, Urban Development & Urban Housing Department (UD&UHD), Ahmedabad Janmarg Limited, AMTS, Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Limited, and the GOLYMPIC team. Once completed, the proposed metro link will enhance both intercity and intracity connectivity between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, supporting sustainable urban development and offering a more seamless and efficient commuting experience.

Ministry of  Road, Transport & Highways(MoRTH)

Construction of 8-lane access-controlled Highways of NH 248S for Connectivity to Proposed Vadhavan port

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has proposed the plans for the construction of an 8-lane access-controlled highway along NH-248S to improve connectivity to the upcoming Vadhavan Port in Maharashtra. This strategic infrastructure initiative aims to ensure efficient cargo evacuation and support the port’s development as a major global trade hub. Vadhavan Port, leveraging a natural draft of approximately 20 meters, is being developed to accommodate large container vessels. In its first phase, the port will offer a container handling capacity of 15 million TEUs, with expansion to 23.2 million TEUs planned in the second phase. Upon completion, the port is expected to rank among the top 10 container ports worldwide. According to traffic projections, the proposed port access road will handle approximately 57,329 Passenger Car Units (PCUs) by 2030. Efficient multimodal evacuation of cargo remains a central focus of the project, with dedicated rail and road corridors being developed for streamlined movement of bulk and containerized freight.
- Key hinterland connectivity features include:
- Mumbai–Delhi Western Railway Line – 12 km
- Delhi–Mumbai Expressway (NE4) – 21 km
- National Highway-48 (NH-48) – 32 km

The dedicated project road will directly connect the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway and NH-48, significantly enhancing logistics efficiency and reinforcing Vadhavan Port’s role as a strategic gateway for international trade.

Construction of Four Lane Elevated Road in Jodhpur city portion from Mahamandir to Akhaliya Chouraha.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH has proposed the plans for the construction of a 4-lane elevated corridor in Jodhpur city, extending from Mahamandir to Akhaliya Chouraha. Strategically aligned along NH-62 and NH-125, the project aims to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance urban mobility across one of Rajasthan’s busiest city corridors. The proposed 2+2 lane elevated structure will span 7.633 km, bypassing 8 major and 20 minor junctions, and is expected to reduce travel time by approximately 20 minutes during peak hours. Key junctions along the route include Mahamandir, Paota Circle, Nai Sadak Chouraha, Ranchordas Mandir Junction, Jalori Gate, 5th Chopasani Road Circle, Bombay Motor Circle, and Akhaliya Chauraha. Out of the total length, 3.50 km will run along NH-62 (from Mahamandir to Station Road), and 1.25 km along NH-125 (from Bombay Motor Circle to Soorsagar Road). The corridor is being designed to meet growing traffic demands, with lane requirements projected to double over the next two decades based on current usage patterns. Once completed, the elevated road will ensure seamless and congestion-free movement across NH-62, NH-125, and NH-25, supporting the city’s long-term development goals and improving connectivity across key urban and regional nodes.

MMLP Hyderabad

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has proposed to develop a Multi-Modal Logistics Park (MMLP) at Parkibanda village in Manoharabad Mandal, Medak district, Telangana. Spanning 315 acres, the proposed facility is aimed at transforming freight logistics in the region by facilitating seamless cargo movement, improving connectivity, and promoting economic growth. The MMLP is projected to handle 1.47 million metric tonnes (MMT) of cargo annually starting 2028, with capacity expected to scale up to 19.98 MMT by 2070. The facility will offer integrated services such as modal shift, cargo aggregation/disaggregation, and customs clearance—benefiting industries in and around Hyderabad. The site is strategically located within a 50 km radius of key industrial hubs including Chandulal Baradari, Sanathnagar, and Azamabad Industrial Estates, and is in close proximity to Jeedimetla, Balanagar, and Cherlapalli Industrial Areas.

The site offers robust multimodal connectivity. It is connected to NH-44 via the existing village road and lies less than 5 km from Manoharabad Railway Station. Upon completion of the Regional Ring Road, the MMLP will have seamless access to major freight corridors, including Mumbai and Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT)—a key gateway for cargo bound to and from Hyderabad.

This strategic development is part of MoRTH’s broader initiative to modernize India’s logistics infrastructure, reduce freight costs, and support economic competitiveness.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has proposed to  develop a Multi-Modal Logistics Park (MMLP) at Jaitiya village, located in Fatuah Taluka of Patna district, Bihar. Spread over 106.19 acres (42.97 hectares), the proposed facility is projected to handle 5.43 million metric tonnes (MMT) of cargo annually by 2071, and is poised to become a major logistics hub for the region.

Strategically located, the site is just 6.2 km from Top Sarthua Railway Station, 30 km from Patna Airport, and 20 km from ISBT Patna (Zero Mile), providing strong multimodal connectivity. It lies within a 30 km radius of key industrial clusters including Fatuah, Patliputra, and Kopakala Industrial Areas, making it ideally positioned to support both regional and long-distance freight movement. The MMLP will benefit from proximity to the Patna–Gaya railway line (9 km away) and direct access to major freight corridors via NH-131G, NH-31, NH-139, NH-22, NH-119D, and State Highway-1 (SH-1). These routes connect the park to key trade nodes such as Patna International Airport, Kolkata, and Haldia Port, enabling seamless domestic and international cargo movement. With its central location, phased development strategy, and integrated infrastructure, the Jaitiya MMLP is set to play a vital role in modernizing Bihar’s logistics ecosystem and supporting the region’s economic growth.

The meeting was chaired by Joint Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Shri Pankaj Kumar.
