## India Participates in 2nd Session of IALA Council as Vice President in Nice, France

India, as the Vice President of the International Organization for Marine Aids to Navigation (IALA), actively participated in the 2nd Session of the IALA Council, held in Nice, France. The IALA Council is the key decision-making body of the intergovernmental organization responsible for marine aids to navigation.

The Indian delegation was led by Shri T.K. Ramachandran, Secretary, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, and included Shri Mukesh Mangal, Joint Secretary, and Shri Karthick Chensudar, Director.

During the opening session, Secretary (PSW) delivered a keynote address, highlighting India’s longstanding association with IALA and its significant progress in marine aids to navigation and vessel traffic services. He emphasized the initiatives of the Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL), including:
- Integration of vessel traffic services across 12 major ports
- Planned international training programs at the Marine Navigation Training Institute in Kolkata

He also extended a formal invitation to all member states to attend the 3rd IALA General Assembly in December 2025 and the 21st IALA Conference in 2027, both to be held in Mumbai.

India has been a longstanding and committed member of IALA since its inception in 1957 and a Council member since 1980 through the Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships. India has actively contributed to harmonizing marine aids to navigation and building capacity to ensure safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible maritime operations.

India’s election as Vice President of IALA during the 1st General Assembly in Singapore reflects its growing global influence and strategic maritime vision.

The Council discussed key technical matters, including:
- Harmonization of marine aids to navigation
- Conservation of lighthouse heritage
- Emerging developments such as the Harmonised Internet of Things (IoT) protocol for visual AtoN
- Maritime Service Registry specifications
- Programme schedule for IALA activities planned for 2025 and 2026

India’s proactive role was appreciated, with Council members welcoming its upcoming leadership in hosting major IALA events. India’s active engagement reflects its commitment to maritime safety, innovation, and heritage preservation.
