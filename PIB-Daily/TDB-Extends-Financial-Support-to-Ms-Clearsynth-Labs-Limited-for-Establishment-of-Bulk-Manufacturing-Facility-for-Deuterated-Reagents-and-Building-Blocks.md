## “TDB Extends Financial Support to M/s Clearsynth Labs Limited for Establishment of Bulk Manufacturing Facility for Deuterated Reagents and Building Blocks”

In a decisive step towards building India’s capabilities in advanced specialty chemicals, the Technology Development Board (TDB), under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, has extended financial support to M/s Clearsynth Labs Limited for setting up a dedicated manufacturing facility for the commercial-scale production of deuterated reagentsand building blocks.

The non-nuclear applications of deuterium are increasingly finding traction across industries. Bulk manufacturing of deuterated reagents and building blocks is becoming increasingly important globally, as other than the use of Deuterium labelled compounds for Clinical Research applications and Pharma research, it has potential application in Medicinal Chemistry and non-medicinal industrial sectors of the market.

Currently, India imports the majority of deuterated solvents. The initiative comes at a time when deuterated compounds are witnessing increasing global demand across sectors such as pharmaceuticals, OLEDs, semiconductors, and fiber optics. Despite India’s robust pharmaceutical manufacturing base, most Indian manufacturers are geared for standard APIs, not isotope-labelled compounds. The country has remained reliant on imports in this strategically important yet niche segment due to the lack of scalable, high-purity production technologies within the domestic ecosystem.This project is a transformative move to strengthen domestic capabilities in high-value chemicals for pharma, OLED, semiconductors, and fiber optics.

TDB’s support will enable the establishment of a dedicated facility forbulk manufacturing of deuterated reagents and building blocks,indigenously, that not only addresses this gap but also lays the foundation for India’s emergence as a global supplier of high-value deuterated compounds. The project is aligned with the Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat missions, aimed at strengthening self-reliance in high-end chemical technologies.

This project, supported by TDB has the advantage of Clearsynth's agreement with the Heavy Water Board (HWB), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Government of India, ensuring long-term access to heavy water. This collaboration extends this facility a distinct competitive edge and scalability, essential for global competitiveness. India is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.

The new facility, backed by TDB, will serve high-end global and domestic customers engaged in pharmaceutical research, complex chemical synthesis, and advanced industrial applications. It also supports India’s ambitions to become a preferred sourcing destination for specialty isotopic chemicals.

With TDB’s support, the project is expected to contribute significantly towards:

Building indigenous capabilities in isotope-labelled compounds

Saving foreign exchange by replacing imports

Fostering innovation through IP generation

Creating high-skilled jobs in chemical manufacturing and R&D

Positioning India as a reliable global supplier in a high-value niche segment

Speaking on the agreement signing, Shri Rajesh Kumar Pathak, Secretary, TDB, said,“This project positions India to capitalise on the rapidly expanding global market for deuterated compounds with widespread industrial applications. The bulk manufacturing of such materials is a strategically valuable and high growth opportunity.

TDB’s support to this project enables the creation of an indigenous, world-class manufacturing base in this high-growth sector.” With rising global demand, a supportive domestic ecosystem, and increasing interest in innovative and differentiated drugs, India can emerge as a key supplier in this niche but valuable space.

Echoing the sentiment, Mr. Vijay Ambati, MD & CEO, Clearsynth Labs, stated: “Manufacturing deuterated solvents and building blocks meeting stringent specifications at a competitive price to compete globally is challenging. With TDB’s backing, we are confident in building India’s scalable capability in this domain, aligned with the nation’s vision for self-reliance and export leadership in specialty chemicals.”
