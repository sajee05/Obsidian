### Discusses Marine Resource Management, Sustainable Fisheries, and the Blue EconomyIndia, Norway Discuss Ocean Governance and Blue Economy at UN Ocean ConferenceDr. Jitendra Singh Discusses Strengthening Fisheries Partnership with Norway at UNOC3

Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh today held a 'bilateral' with Ms. Marianne Sivertsen Ness, Norway’s Minister of Fisheries and Ocean Policy to discuss a range of issues concerning sustainable fisheries, marine resource management, sustainable fisheries and the broader framework of the blue economy.

Later at the delegation level talks led by the two Ministers, India and Norway reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen collaboration on sustainable ocean governance and fisheries during a bilateral meeting held on the sidelines of the 3rd United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC3), currently underway in Nice, France.

During the interaction, the two Ministers exchanged views on enhancing bilateral cooperation in ocean governance, reflecting on the long-standing partnership between India and Norway in the fisheries sector. The discussion also covered shared priorities such as sustainable use of marine resources, improved data sharing mechanisms, and joint efforts to tackle challenges like overfishing and marine pollution.

Both sides acknowledged the significance of international cooperation in achieving the goals of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030), with an emphasis on knowledge exchange, capacity building, and technology sharing. The Ministers also explored opportunities to build on existing India-Norway collaborations, particularly in areas aligned with the development of a sustainable and inclusive blue economy.

The UNOC3, taking place from June 9 to 13, has brought together global leaders, scientists, policymakers, and industry representatives to discuss collective actions toward ocean health, sustainable development, and climate resilience.

India’s participation, led by Dr. Jitendra Singh, reflects the country’s commitment to playing an active role in shaping the global ocean agenda, while also safeguarding the interests of coastal communities and promoting sustainable ocean-based livelihoods.

The discussions in Nice come at a time when countries worldwide are scaling up efforts to balance economic growth with marine conservation. The India-Norway dialogue is seen as a step forward in reinforcing multilateral cooperation to ensure long-term sustainability of ocean resources.
