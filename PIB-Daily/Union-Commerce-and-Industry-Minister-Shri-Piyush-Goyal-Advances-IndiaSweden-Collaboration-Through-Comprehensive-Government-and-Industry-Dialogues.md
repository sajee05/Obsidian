The visit aimed at further deepening the bilateral economic relationship, enhancing trade and investment flows, and exploring new avenues of cooperation in emerging sectors.

In his official interactions, Shri Goyal met with H.E. Mr. Benjamin Dousa, Minister for International Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade, and H.E.

The meeting witnessed participation from key Swedish institutions including LeadIT, Vinnova, the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish National Space Agency, the National Board of Trade, the Swedish Export Credit Agency, Business Sweden, and the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in India. Both sides underscored their shared commitment to advancing joint projects in green transition, advanced technologies, and resilient supply chains.

Shri Goyal also addressed the India–Sweden Business Leaders’ Roundtable, where he interacted with key members of Swedish industry.
