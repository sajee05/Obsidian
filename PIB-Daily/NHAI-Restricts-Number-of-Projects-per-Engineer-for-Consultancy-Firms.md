## NHAI Restricts Number of Projects per Engineer for Consultancy Firms

To enhance quality and supervision mechanism of the National Highway projects, NHAI has restricted the maximum number of 10 projects per ‘Engineer’ for the consultancy firms for supervision of construction or maintenance of National Highway projects.  It was observed that the Consultancy Firms working as Independent Engineer, Authority Engineer or Supervision Consultant are assigning supervision obligations of many projects to a designated ‘Engineer’.

The compliance of specifications and contract provisions is primarily controlled and supervised by the Consultant’s team through the designated ‘Engineer’ assigned to a particular project. Due to more number of projects in hand, the designated ‘Engineer’ may not be able to fulfil contractual obligations, defeating the purpose of qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the projects.

Detailed clauses have also been included in the guidelines for consultancy firms implementing and maintaining National Highway projects on Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM) and Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) mode. The clauses include provisions for the appointment of Independent Engineers/Authority Engineers and Delegation of responsibilities.

The designated ‘Engineer’ from the Consulting firm is required to visit the assigned project site every month and provide inputs in the Monthly Progress Report as per Consultancy and Civil contract provisions. The restriction of a maximum of Ten projects per ‘Engineer’ shall come into effect after 60 days, providing time to the Consultancy firms to make appropriate adjustments in this period.

Restricting the maximum number of projects per ‘Engineer’ will not only enhance operational efficiency and ensure high quality implementation as well as maintenance of highways but will also go a long way to ensure safe, smooth, and seamless travel experience on the National Highways across the country.
