According to Functionalism, what is the definition of 'function'?\nFunction is defined as the contribution that a social institution makes to the maintenance and well-being of the whole society.\n\n## 2. What is one major criticism of Functionalism regarding societal agreement?\nFunctionalists assume a value consensus which may not exist in the society.\n\n## 3. How is Functionalism criticized for its view on conflict?\nIt sees society as very orderly, peaceful, and harmonious, which may not always be the case; it ignores conflict and chaos.\n\n## 4. How is Functionalism criticized for its stance on the existing social order?\nIt tends to justify the status quo or the prevailing arrangements in society.\n\n## 5. What is the criticism of Functionalism concerning causality?\nIt uses tautological explanations, erroneously equating causes with functions within the society.\n\n## 6. How does Functionalism's view of the individual agency draw criticism?\nIt ignores the agency of the individual, suggesting that society dictates actions and the individual merely follows.\n\n## 7. What is the primary work by Émile Durkheim on the theory of religion?\nHis primary work is \"The Elementary Forms of Religious Life.\"\n\n## 8. How did Durkheim define religion?\nDurkheim defined religion as a unified system of beliefs and practices related to sacred things.\n\n## 9. What is the core distinction Durkheim made regarding things in society?\nHe made a fundamental distinction between sacred and profane things.\n\n## 10. What are sacred things according to Durkheim?\nSacred things are those which are set apart and forbidden.\n\n## 11. Provide some examples of sacred things mentioned in the notes.\nExamples include the Holy Bible for Christians, the River Ganga for Hindus, cows in Hindu culture, sacred books, and religious symbols.\n\n## 12. What are profane things according to Durkheim?\nProfane things are ordinary, everyday things.\n\n## 13. Provide some examples of profane things mentioned in the notes.\nExamples include tap water, a donkey, and everyday objects used casually.\n\n## 14. How does the sacred relate to the profane according to Durkheim?\nThe sacred is always separated and set apart from all other objects, particularly the profane.\n\n## 15. What is a key rule concerning access to the sacred from the profane realm?\nThe sacred thing is that which the profane cannot touch and should not touch with impunity. Detailed rules are laid down on how the sacred is to be approached, and it cannot be casually interacted with.\n\n## 16. How is the sacred maintained as distinct?\nThe sacred is protected and isolated through strong prohibitions and taboos.\n\n## 17. Is the utility of a thing relevant to its sacredness?\nNo, it is not the utility of a thing which makes it sacred. Anything can be sacred, regardless of its practical use.\n\n## 18. Which realm, sacred or profane, is considered superior in terms of power and dignity?\nThe sacred is infinitely superior to the profane in terms of power and dignity.\n\n## 19. Are things inherently sacred or profane?\nNo, things are not inherently or always sacred or profane; their status can be context-dependent.\n\n## 20. How can things shift between the sacred and profane categories?\nObjects may make a passage from the profane to the sacred and from sacred to profane through rituals.\n\n## 21. Provide examples illustrating the context dependency of sacredness.\nLaddus are profane when purchased but become sacred when taken to a temple; Bhagawa rang (saffron color) is profane when used to play Holi but becomes sacred when used in a religious context.\n\n## 22. Which tribe did Durkheim study in \"The Elementary Forms of Religious Life\"?\nHe studied the ARUNTA tribe.\n\n## 23. Describe the ARUNTA tribe's social organization.\nThey were a small-sized, simple, and primitive tribe of Australian aborigines, divided into exogamous clans.\n\n## 24. What does exogamy mean?\nExogamy means marrying outside one's own group.\n\n## 25. How is exogamy practiced in Indian society, according to the notes' example?\nIn Indian society, there is caste endogamy (marrying within one's caste) but gotra exogamy (marrying outside one's gotra).\n\n## 26. What is Totemism as observed in the ARUNTA tribe?\nIn Totemism, each clan was represented by a particular plant or animal symbol.\n\n## 27. What is the definition of a totem?\nThe symbol of the clan is known as the totem.\n\n## 28. How was the totem physically represented in the ARUNTA tribe?\nEach clan had its own flag with the totem symbol carved on it, and the totem was also carved on the churunga (a piece of wood used to make sound).\n\n## 29. What was the religious significance of the churunga for the ARUNTA tribe?\nThe churunga was a very sacred object for the members of the clan and an integral part of their religious practices.\n\n## 30. What was Durkheim's central finding regarding the ARUNTA tribe's worship practices?\nHe found that members of a clan worship their totem, and the totem represents the clan itself.\n\n## 31. What was Durkheim's key conclusion about the nature of religion?\nReligion is simply members of a society worshipping itself.\n\n## 32. How did Durkheim relate God and society?\nHe stated that God is society divinized; God and society are not two different things, God is society itself.\n\n## 33. According to Durkheim, what is the primary function of religion?\nReligion provides the members of a society with a shared sense of morality.\n\n## 34. How does religion contribute to shared morality?\nIt helps develop a consensus on what is considered good and bad conduct.\n\n## 35. Provide an example of how religion reflects shared morality, as given in the notes.\nWe worship Sri Ram because he is seen as the ideal man (Maryada Purushottam) who conformed to the shared morality of the society.\n\n## 36. What is another significant function of religion identified by Durkheim?\nReligion helps society maintain social control.\n\n## 37. How does religion facilitate social control?\nIt provides a very strict code of dos and don'ts, defining certain things as sacred and others as taboo.\n\n## 38. Why are religious sanctions often more effective than legal sanctions?\nWhen important social rules are codified in religion as sacred, it provides a very effective mechanism of social control because religious sanctions are often stronger than legal sanctions.\n\n## 39. What is the relationship between man and God, according to Durkheim's insight?\nThe relationship between man and God is exactly the same as the relationship between man and society.\n\n## 40. Describe the nature of the man-God/society relationship.\nIt is a relationship of man's dependence on God/society.\n\n## 41. What are the characteristics of the man-God/society relationship?\nIt is a very unequal, asymmetrical arrangement where God/society is all powerful, and the individual is dependent.\n\n## 42. What function does this dependent relationship serve?\nIt imbues people with a sense of humility, acknowledging their limitations and dependence.\n\n## 43. How does religion provide strength to individuals?\nReligion is an important source of strength, particularly during difficult times.\n\n## 44. During which type of difficult event is religion especially helpful?\nIt is particularly helpful during tragic events like death.\n\n## 45. What mechanisms does religion use to help individuals cope with death?\nIt provides concepts like afterlife and the soul continuing to exist, and it may deny or rationalize the fact of death.\n\n## 46. How does society provide support through religion during difficult times?\nSociety comes together during religious rituals to offer support and consolation.\n\n## 47. What phenomenon occurs during religious rituals involving collective acts?\nSuch collective acts produce a collective effervescence.\n\n## 48. What kind of collective acts are often involved in religious rituals?\nReligious rituals are often accompanied by collective singing, chanting, and dancing.\n\n## 49. What is 'collective effervescence'?\nIt is a pulsating energy created when a collectivity sings or dances together.\n\n## 50. What is the effect of collective effervescence?\nIt strengthens the bonds binding the individual to the religious community and increases the sense of commitment and bonding.\n\n## 51. Provide examples of acts that can produce collective effervescence.\nChanting \"Jai Mata Di\" collectively, singing a national anthem, or the Islamic Azan can produce collective effervescence.\n\n## 52. What is considered the primary function of religion by Durkheim?\nReligion is considered an important source of social solidarity.\n\n## 53. How does religion enhance social cohesion?\nIt serves as a unifying force that enhances social cohesion.\n\n## 54. What is Durkheim's complete definition of religion, incorporating its social function?\nReligion is a unified system of beliefs and practices related to sacred things which unites its members into a single moral community called the church.\n\n## 55. What historical period provided the context for Durkheim's observations on religion in modern society?\nDurkheim was writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after the French and Industrial revolutions.\n\n## 56. What process seemed to be occurring regarding religion during this period?\nReligion seemed to be on a perceptible decline in European society, a process known as secularization.\n\n## 57. What replaced religious explanations in the modernizing society?\nScience had largely replaced religious theological explanations.\n\n## 58. Did Durkheim believe religion was dying in modern society?\nNo, according to Durkheim, religion had not declined or died in modern society.\n\n## 59. How did Durkheim interpret the changes in modern religion?\nHe believed that the old notions of the sacred had been replaced by a new set of sacreds.\n\n## 60. What is a key characteristic of modern society's 'sacred' realm, according to Durkheim?\nModern society is characterized by nation worship, which forms a new sacred realm.\n\n## 61. Provide examples of new sacred objects in modern society according to Durkheim.\nExamples include the national flag, which is sacred and governed by a flag code; the national anthem, which produces collective effervescence; the constitution, seen as the sacred text; and the national emblem, a new sacred symbol.\n\n## 62. Why are new sacreds considered necessary in modern society?\nModern society is heterogeneous and multicultural, unlike traditional homogeneous society, and therefore needs a new shared morality and sacred symbols to maintain unity.\n\n## 63. What term does Durkheim use to describe the religion of modern society?\nHe characterizes modern society by civic religion that cuts across parochial identities.\n\n## 64. What is one major criticism of Durkheim's theory of religion concerning conflict?\nIt is criticized for ignoring or downplaying the huge amounts of conflict and violence that religion has caused throughout history.\n\n## 65. Provide historical evidence cited against Durkheim's view on conflict in religion.\nReligion has led to major conflicts like communal riots, Crusades, the Shia-Sunni divide, and wars between religious communities.\n\n## 66. What methodological issue is raised against Durkheim's study of the ARUNTA tribe?\nHe is criticized as an armchair sociologist who never visited the ARUNTA tribe himself.\n\n## 67. What was the basis of Durkheim's analysis of the ARUNTA tribe?\nHe based his analysis on ethnographies written by others, which could potentially be biased, as he did no direct field work.\n\n## 68. What is the criticism regarding Durkheim's sacred-profane dichotomy?\nCritics argue that it creates a false dichotomy, treating sacred and profane as either/or categories, while in reality, many things may be neither purely sacred nor purely profane.\n\n## 69. Provide examples of things that challenge the strict sacred-profane dichotomy.\nNotebooks (associated with Vidya but not purely sacred), daily meals, and money (associated with Lakshmi Mata) are examples that are not purely sacred or profane.\n\n## 70. What is a criticism regarding the applicability of Durkheim's theory?\nHis theory may be limited in applicability, perhaps explaining the beliefs of small-scale primitive tribes like the ARUNTA, but possibly not equally applicable to large-scale complex world religions like Islam or Hinduism, which have multiple philosophies, scriptures, and interpretations.\n\n## 71. How is Durkheim's view on secularization criticized?\nCritics argue that old sacreds have not been completely replaced by new sacreds in modern societies, and traditional religions continue to play an important role.\n\n## 72. How is religion criticized as a source of immorality?\nReligion is seen as legitimizing oppression and exploitation, sanctioning regressive practices like Sati pratha, child marriage, polygamy, and untouchability.\n\n## 73. What was B.R. Ambedkar's critique regarding religion?\nAmbedkar criticized religion, particularly Hinduism, as potentially a source of immorality that teaches practices like untouchability.\n\n## 74. What is the feminist criticism of Durkheim's theory?\nFeminist scholars suggest that all major religions are patriarchal and justify women's oppression.\n\n## 75. Provide examples of how religions are seen as patriarchal.\nHinduism has passages in Manusmriti against women's rights; Islam and Judaism have practices like women being considered half witnesses, and practices like hijab, nikah halala, and triple talaq are seen as oppressive to women. ⭐(The statement that 'all major religions are patriarchal' is a strong generalization subject to debate and varying interpretations within and across religions. It's a critical perspective, not a universally accepted fact.)\n\n## 76. Which feminist scholars are mentioned in the notes as critics of the patriarchal nature of religion?\nKaren Armstrong and Kamla Bhasin are mentioned.\n\n## 77. What criticism is raised regarding the unity of the ARUNTA tribe?\nThe criticism is that the ARUNTA people were unified at the level of the tribe, not solely at the level of the clan; since the totem was clan-specific, there must have been something other than the totem unifying them across clan lines.\n\n## 78. What is the title of Durkheim's first major work?\nHis first major work was titled \"Division of Labor in Society.\"\n\n## 79. What is the basic concept of the division of labor?\nDivision of labor means the splitting up of an activity into a number of smaller processes.\n\n## 80. What happens after an activity is split into smaller processes through division of labor?\nThese different processes are then undertaken by different persons, leading to specialization.\n\n## 81. How did economists, like Adam Smith, primarily view the division of labor?\nEconomists primarily saw the division of labor as beneficial for production efficiency.\n\n## 82. What historical event significantly highlighted the economic benefits of the division of labor?\nThe Industrial Revolution, where division of labor led to a massive increase in production and productivity.\n\n## 83. How did Durkheim's approach to the division of labor differ from that of economists?\nFor Durkheim, the division of labor was not merely in the realm of economy or production; it had broader benefits for the whole of society beyond just increased production and efficiency.\n\n## 84. According to Durkheim, what needs does the division of labor meet?\nThe division of labor meets some very vital needs of the society.\n\n## 85. Is the division of labor limited to the economy?\nNo, the division of labor exists in every aspect of our social lives, such as in the family and the education system.\n\n## 86. What is the central question Durkheim addressed concerning modern society and the division of labor?\nThe central question is: If modern society is characterized by heightened individualism, what prevents society from falling apart?\n\n## 87. How does the orientation of traditional society compare to that of modern society?\nTraditional society has a collective orientation (collectivism), whereas modern society is characterized by heightened individualism.\n\n## 88. How does individual focus differ between traditional and modern societies?\nIn traditional society, individual aspirations were suppressed, while in modern society, individualism is legitimized.\n\n✓ Topic coverage check: All sections of the provided text, including recap of functionalism, Durkheim's theory of religion (definition, sacred/profane, Arunta tribe, totemism, conclusion on society worship, functions, religion in modern society, criticisms), and the introduction to the division of labor (concept, comparison with economic view, Durkheim's approach, central question, comparison of traditional/modern societies) have been covered through sequential questions and answers.\n</smtcmp_block>",
