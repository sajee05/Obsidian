Compare and contrast traditional society and modern society based on the concepts of collective orientation, individualism, and the social challenge they face.\n\nâœ“ Topic coverage check: All major aspects covered including Functionalism recap and criticisms, Durkheim's religion theory (primary work, definition, Sacred/Profane distinction, Arunta study, society worship conclusion, functions), Religion in Modern Society (secularization, new sacreds, civic religion), Criticisms of Religion theory, and Introduction to Division of Labor (book, definition, economic vs sociological view, central question, traditional vs modern society comparison).\n\n**Answers:**\n\n1.  Function is the contribution that a social institution makes to the maintenance and well being of the whole society.\n2.  Major criticisms include assuming a value consensus that may not exist, ignoring conflict and chaos, justifying the status quo, using tautological explanations (equating causes and functions), and ignoring individual agency.\n3.  \"The Elementary Forms of Religious Life\" is the primary work.\n4.  Religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices related to sacred things.\n5.  Sacred things are those which are set apart and forbidden, while profane things are ordinary, everyday things.\n6.  Examples of Sacred things: Holy Bible, Ganga, cows in Hindu culture, sacred books, religious symbols. Examples of Profane things: tap water, donkey, everyday objects.\n7.  Key principles: separation of sacred from profane, forbidden access of profane to sacred, protection of sacred through prohibitions/taboos, sacredness not about utility, sacred is superior in power/dignity, sacredness is context dependent, and objects can transition between categories through rituals.\n8.  Anything can be sacred (pebble, stone, plant, etc.); the profane may often be far more useful than the sacred, showing utility is not the basis.\n9.  Objects may make a passage from the profane to the sacred and from sacred to profane through rituals. Examples: Laddus purchased (profane) becoming sacred when taken to temple; Bhagawa rang used for Holi (profane) becoming sacred in a religious context.\n10. The Arunta tribe is described as a small-sized, simple and primitive tribe of Australian aborigines divided into exogamous clans.\n11. Exogamy means marrying outside one's group. In Indian society, cast endogamy but gotra exogamy is mentioned as a comparison.\n12. The symbol of the clan, typically a plant or animal, is known as the totem.\n13. The totem was carved on the clan's flag and also on the churunga (a piece of wood with thread).\n14. The churunga was a very sacred object for the members of the clan and an integral part of their various religious practices.\n15. Religion is simply members of a society worshipping itself.\n16. This assertion means that God and society are not two different things; God is society itself, elevated and divinized in the minds of its members.\n17. The six functions are: Shared Sense of Morality, Social Control, Relationship Between Man and God/Society, Source of Strength During Difficult Times, Collective Effervescence, and Social Solidarity.\n18. Religion provides a shared sense of morality by helping members develop a consensus on what is considered good and bad conduct. The example is worshipping Sri Ram as the ideal man (Maryada Purushottam) who conformed to shared morality.\n19. Religion helps maintain social control by providing a strict code of dos and don'ts and defining certain things as taboo. Religious sanctions are considered stronger than legal sanctions. The example given for social control is the protection of Gau mata.\n20. The relationship between man and God is exactly the same as the relationship between man and society. It is a relationship of man's dependence on God/society, characterized as very unequal and asymmetrical where God/society is all powerful and the individual dependent. Its function is to imbue people with a sense of humility, acknowledging their limitations and dependence.\n21. Religion provides concepts like afterlife and the soul continuing to exist, denies or rationalizes the fact of death, and facilitates community support and consolation through religious rituals during tragic events.\n22. Collective Effervescence refers to the pulsating energy and heightened emotions produced by collective acts like singing, chanting, and dancing during religious rituals. Examples include chanting \"Jai Mata Di\", singing the national anthem, or the Islamic Azan.\n23. Collective effervescence strengthens the bonds binding the individual to the religious community and increases the sense of commitment and bonding.\n24. The primary function of religion is social solidarity. Durkheim defines religion as a unified system of beliefs and practices related to sacred things which unites its members into a single moral community called the church.\n25. Durkheim was writing in the late 19th/early 20th century after the French and Industrial revolutions, a time when religion seemed to be in perceptible decline in European society due to the process of secularization and science replacing religious explanations.\n26. According to Durkheim, religion had not declined or died but had transformed; the old notions of the sacred were replaced by a new set of sacreds.\n27. The new sacreds relate to nation worship or civic religion.\n28. Examples of modern sacred objects include the national flag, national anthem, and the constitution.\n29. Modern society is heterogeneous and multicultural, unlike traditional homogeneous society, and needs new shared morality and sacred symbols that cut across parochial identities to maintain unity.\n30. Major criticisms include: Ignoring Conflict and Violence, Methodological Issues, False Sacred-Profane Dichotomy, Limited Applicability, Incomplete Secularization, Source of Immorality, and Patriarchal Nature.\n31. This criticism argues that Durkheim's focus is one-sidedly positive and downplays the conflict and violence religion generates. Historical examples given are communal riots, crusades, the Shia-Sunni divide, and wars between religious communities.\n32. Methodological issues include that Durkheim was an armchair sociologist who never visited the Arunta tribe, based his analysis on potentially biased secondary ethnographies written by others, and did no direct field work.\n33. The dichotomy is criticized as false because in real life, many things are neither purely sacred nor purely profane but exist in a more complex space. Examples given are notebooks, daily meals, and money (due to Lakshmi Mata association).\n34. The theory is considered limited because it may help explain religious beliefs of small-scale primitive tribes like the Arunta but may not be equally applicable to large-scale complex world religions like Islam or Hinduism, which have multiple philosophies, scriptures, and interpretations.\n35. Religion is criticized for legitimizing oppression and exploitation and sanctioning regressive practices. Examples include Satipratha, child marriage, polygamy, and untouchability. Ambedkar's critique of Hinduism teaching untouchability is cited.\n36. Feminist criticism by scholars like Karen Armstrong and Kamla Bhasin suggests major religions are patriarchal and justify women's oppression. Examples include passages in Manusmriti against women's rights in Hinduism, and practices like women being considered half witnesses, hijab, nikah halala, and triple talaq in Islam/Judaism.\n37. The criticism is that the Arunta people were unified at the level of the tribe, not just the clan level represented by the totem. Since the totem was clan-specific, there must have been something other than the totem that unified the Arunta people across clan lines, which Durkheim's theory might miss.\n38. The title is \"Division of Labor in Society\".\n39. Division of labor means the splitting up of an activity into a number of smaller processes, which are then undertaken by different persons (specialization).\n40. Economists like Adam Smith saw the division of labor primarily as beneficial for production efficiency, leading to a massive increase in production. Durkheim, however, saw it as existing beyond just the economy and production, offering broader benefits to the whole society and meeting some very vital societal needs.\n41. Beyond economic efficiency, the division of labor meets some very vital needs of the whole society and exists in every aspect of social life (family, education system, etc.), suggesting broader social benefits.\n42. The central question is how society holds together in modern times, characterized by heightened individualism, when each person is striving for their own goals, potentially preventing society from falling apart.\n43. Traditional society is characterized by collective orientation (collectivism) where individual aspirations are suppressed. Modern society is characterized by heightened individualism, where individualism is legitimized. The social challenge for modern society is how it holds together when everyone pulls in different directions, a challenge not faced by traditional society.\n</smtcmp_block>",
