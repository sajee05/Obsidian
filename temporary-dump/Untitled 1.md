## 71. How is Durkheim's view on secularization criticized?
Critics argue that old sacreds have not been completely replaced by new sacreds in modern societies, and traditional religions continue to play an important role.

## 76. Which feminist scholars are mentioned in the notes as critics of the patriarchal nature of religion?
Karen Armstrong and Kamla Bhasin are mentioned.

## 77. What criticism is raised regarding the unity of the ARUNTA tribe?
