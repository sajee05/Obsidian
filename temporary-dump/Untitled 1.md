### Environmental Impact Assessment
#### Introduction
- EIA is a regulatory framework used to identify, predict, evaluate and mitigate the potential environmental impacts of development projects.

#### EIA Process - SSB-APM-Public-MPC
- Screening
- Scoping
- Baseline Data Analysis
- Impact prediction
- Assessment of alternatives, delineation of mitigation measures
- Public Hearing
- Environmental Management Plan
- Monitoring and Environmental Clearances(EC)

#### Significance
- informed decision making
- identifying mitigation measures (Delhi Metro project)
- Compliance with environmental regulations (CRZ for projects in coastal areas)
- Assessment of the social impact (Tehri dam )
- public consultations allow local communities to voice their concerns (POSCO case)
- inclusiveness in decision making - overall quality
- protection of biodiversity (harmful impact of Gundia hydropower project on Western Ghats);

#### Shortcomings of EIA(notification), 2020
- Exemptions - strategic projects, 'economically sensitive areas' beyond preview of EIA
- Post-Facto Clearance : raises concerns about accountability
- Public Consultation: Reduced to max 40 days and only 20 days
- Expert Committees nominated by government : concern about independence and autonomy
- Transparency and accountability concerns:
    - instances of manipulating data, inadequate monitoring
- **Government Initiatives**
    - National Green tribunal
    - PARIVESH - pro-active and responsive facilitation by interactive, virtuous and environmental single-window Hub

#### Measures | Way forward
- Sectoral EIA is needed
- Creating institutional capacity - clearance, monitoring and compliance
    - Independent EIA Authority
- Insurance and penal action
- Risk financing, risk minimized technology
- Creation of centralized baseline data bank
- Environment supplement plan
- **Prevent**
    - Wetlands
    - Estuaries
    - Biospheres etc.
- Centralized data bank

#### Conclusion
- To achieve the ancient ideals of “Prakruti Rakshati Rakshita” (Nature protects if protected) requires substantive and sustainable action.

    - Overuse of fertilizers and irrigation leading to salinization and alkalinization of land
    - Climate change : changing precipitation patterns, draughts, extreme weather events
- Examples
    - Sahel Region of Africa
    - Aral Sea
    - Amazon Rainforest
    - Punjab Plains
    - Steppes
- Way forward
    - Reforestation
    - Sustainable agriculture
    - Watershed development and rainwater harvesting
    - Land management practices like sand fences, shelterbelt, windbreaks

## Vulnerability
- Vulnerability is the potential for damage due to disaster. It encompasses various dimensions, including physical, social, economic, and environmental aspects.

- Characterizing Vulnerability
    - Exposure : degree to which people, property, and infrastructure are located in disaster-prone areas.
    - Sensitivity : The degree to which people and systems are affected by hazards.
    - Resilience : ability to adapt and recover for impact of hazard
    - Coping capacity : resources and skills available to cope with disaster
- Types of Vulnerability
    - Physical :
        - Quality, location, and design of buildings and infrastructure
        - population density
    - Social :
        - Factors like age, gender, disability, and health status influencing capacities.
            - E.g. elderlies more prone
        - Levels of education and awareness

- Economic :
    - Low income levels
    - Dependence on vulnerable livelihoods like forest, agriculture, fishing
- Environmental :
    - Degradation of ecosystems such as deforestation, wetland loss
    - Changes in climate patterns
- Institutional : effectiveness of government agencies and institutions

## Carbon cycle
- Weathering of plant material
- Microbial Decomposition
    - Cellulose Breakdown into simpler sugars like glucose.
    - Fermentation glucose into organic acids, alcohols
    - Mineralization
