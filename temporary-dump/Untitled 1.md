            -   Melting of ice caps, warming of oceans faster
        -   ![Geography](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Geography 5.png>)
        -   Role in fishing industries
            -   Nutrient Upwelling
            -   Fish Migration
            -   Temperature Regulation
            -   Habitat Formation
            -   Transportation of Larvae
        -   Impacts on Marine Life
            -   Upwelling currents bring nutrient-rich waters from the deep ocean to the surface supporting rich fisheries.
            -   Influence migration patterns of marine species
            -   Help in the dispersal of larvae and eggs, ensuring the spread of species across different regions
        -   Impact on Coastal Environment:
            -   Regulate sea temperature affecting marine biodiversity
            -   Affect weather and climate patterns :
                -   Moderate temperatures by NORTH ATLANTIC drift
                -   Reducing precipitation by CANARIES
-   Thermohaline circulation
    -   ATLANTIC MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION(AMOC)
        -   Due to the freezing of the surface water in the polar North Atlantic region
-   Water mass : large bodies of relatively uniform temperature, salinity and density
    -   Impacts on Marine Life
        -   Supports Thermohaline Circulation:
            -   ANTARCTIC BOTTOM WATER (AABW) influences AMOC
        -   Water mixing between two water masses create distinct habitats for marine species
            -   Formation of anoxic (oxygen-poor) zone in BLACK SEA
        -   Habitat Creation
            -   E.g. deep-sea brine pools and hydrothermal vents along mid-ocean ridges

## Climatology

-   **Factors/elements of Weather and Climate**
    1.  Temperature.
    2.  Pressure.
    3.  Winds.
    4.  Humidity - Precipitation, Clouds, Condensation
    5.  Sunlight.
-   Earth’s Atmosphere – Composition & Structure
    1.  ![Geography](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Geography 6.png>)
    2.  Troposphere determines weather processes
        -   Global wind circulation
        -   Temperature gradient
        -   Geochemical cycles -
            -   Water cycle - vapor and cloud formation
            -   Carbon cycle - respiration, photosynthesis
        -   Weather system - cyclones, fronts, anticyclones, etc. develop here
        -   Jet streams affects temperature and precipitation patterns
        -   Insolation and absorption of outgoing terrestrial radiation
        -   Heat Exchange : greenhouse effect
-   Solar Radiation, Heat Budget & Temperature
    1.  Heat Budget
        -   Vertical heat budget
            -   ![Geography](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Geography 7.png>)
        -   Horizontal heat budget -
            -   ![Geography](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Geography 8.png>)
    2.  Factors affecting insolation - Rotation, Revolution, Axial tilt, Aspect, clouds, sunspots
    3.  Temperature
        -   latitude
        -   altitude
        -   distance from the sea
        -   air-mass circulation
        -   ocean currents
        -   local aspects - Slope, Vegetation, surface
-   Atmospheric Circulation & Weather Systems
    1.  Winds have forces -
        -   pressure gradient force
        -   frictional force
        -   Coriolis force
        -   gravitational force acts downward
        -   ![Geography](<Z9 Obsidian-files/Media/DOCX/Geography 9.png>)
    2.  Temperature inversion
        -   Radiation - Cold winter nights, clear sky, still air.
        -   Subsidence - Valley breeze (day -> air moves up the valley), mountain breeze(night -> cool air -> down the valley)
        -   Marine - Land breeze (night), sea breeze(day)
        -   Frontal
            -   Air mass (homogeneous, little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture)
                -   Maritime tropical (mT)
                -   Continental tropical (cT)
                -   Maritime polar (mP)
                -   Continental polar (cP)
                -   Continental arctic (cA)
            -   Fronts (middle latitudes, steep gradient in temperature and pressure)
                -   (a) Cold; (b) Warm; (c) Stationary; (d) Occluded
    3.  Precipitation
        -   Sleet
        -   Hail
        -   Snow
