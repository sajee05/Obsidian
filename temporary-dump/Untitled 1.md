## Definitions of Art and Culture (02:09)

### Art
- **Art**: is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination like painting, sculpture, music, dance, architecture

* There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. The three classical branches of visual art are [painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting), [sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture), and [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture).
* [Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre), [dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance), and other [performing arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts), as well as [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature), [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music), [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) and other media such as [interactive media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_media), are included in a broader definition of [the arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts).
* Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [crafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft) or [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciences).
* In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the [fine arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_art) are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the [decorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_arts) or [applied arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_arts).
* The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and [interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic_interpretation), are explored in a branch of philosophy known as [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics). The resulting [artworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artworks) are studied in the professional fields of [art criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_criticism) and the [history of art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_history).

### Culture
- **Culture**: is the customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of group of people regarded collectively

* Culture is an umbrella term which encompasses the [social behaviours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior), [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution), and [norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm) found in [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) [societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society), as well as the [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge), [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief), [arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art), [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law), [customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm), capabilities, and [habits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) of the individuals in these groups.
* Culture is often originated from or attributed to a specific region or location.
* Humans acquire culture through the [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning) processes of [enculturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enculturation) and [socialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.

- **[cultural norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_norm)**: codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behaviour, dress, language, and demeanour in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.

* Thus in military culture, [valour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage) is counted a typical behaviour for an individual and duty, honour, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the [continuum of conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_of_conflict).
* In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.

- **Cultural change, or repositioning**: is the reconstruction of a cultural concept of a society. Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies.

Organizations like [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) attempt to preserve culture and cultural heritage.

* Dayaram Sahni 1921 excavated the first site of Harappa.
* In 1922, second site namely Mohonjdaro discovered by R D Banerjee.
* With the discovery of IVC, it became the world's most advanced civilization.
* Its first civilization started to use a burned brick of the same size and shape. Pyramid of Egypt made from unburnt bricks.
* The Next advanced feature of IVC was immaculate urban planning.

### IVC seals.
* One of the important artefacts found in Indus towns.
* It is one of the most important sources of information about the Indus valley civilization.
* It is a geometrically shaped object mainly made up of soft river stones 'Steatite'.
* There were instances of seals made from silver, gold, copper, bronze, etc.
* Seals were pictographic (pictures and symbols) in nature.
  * ![[ANC_4.jpg]]

#### Purpose of seals.
* Seals were considered as a stamp of the IVC authority.
* Perhaps it was the first type of coinage that facilitated trade.
* Seals also provide important information about the socio-religious practices of that time for example Pasupathi seal. It was considered as an Image of proto-Siva.(Check images In the ancient history handout)
* In the image, the person has depicted seating in a yogic posture which indicates that meditative practices were prevalent during the IVC period.
* The images are further surrounded by many animals which are indicative of nature worship.
* The Pipal leaf seal indicates 'nature worship'.
* The unicorn seal is the most abundant seal found in Indus towns.
* Seals were also used as an Amulate(ताबीज़) to ward off evil.
* Cow, camel, horse and lion were not depicted on seals or no evidence yet found thereof.

### Urban Planning of IVC

#### Salient features
* Roads cut each other at right angles
* Drainage system
* Central place for granaries or city place

![[ANC_5.png]]

* Generally, Indus towns were divided into two parts that are upper towns and lower towns.
* Upper town was created on an upraised platform and it was generally known as citadel area.
* This part of town was mainly meant for administrative buildings. Then specific feature of this part of the town was the presence of granary and provision of public bath.
* Granary means for storage of grains and common bath was for a ritual bath
* The great bath of Mohenjo-Daro is the best example of a common bath in which staircases were created from bricks in the North and south direction.
* In the east and west direction changing rooms were created.

![[ANC_6.png]]

* The lower town was the largest part of the town.
* It was divided into various sectors and there was a very good network of roads.
* Roads used to cut each other at a right angle.
* On both, sides of roads drains were created and they were covered with stone slabs or brick slabs.
* In the drains, there were provisions of the manhole which made the job of cleaning the drains easier and at the same point of time, filtered water was discharged into the ground.
* Inside the structure, houses were created with burned bricks of the same size and shape.

![[ANC_7.png]]

* The size of bricks was 4:2:1(length:width:height).
* There were instances of single-story, double-story, and triple-story houses.
* All the houses were connected with the main drain.
* In the houses, there were the provision of a bedroom, separate kitchen, and washrooms.
* In a few of the houses, there were private wells.
* The Houses in the Town were generally created facing inner lanes rather than the main road.
* Perhaps it was done to safeguard their privacy.(there were gates but no doors in their houses)

### IVC Pottery
* General pottery of IVC was red.
* It was clay-shaped, baked on fire.
* They were used for the storage of grains, water, and also as utensils.
* Perforated(छोटे छोटे छेद) pottery meant for straining liquor.

#### Bronze (Tin + copper) sculpture.
* Lost wax techniques were used for creating bronze sculptures.
* In the very first step, they create a wax figure which was quoted with clay then it was baked on fire.
* After baking it on fire the molten rock wax was removed and molten bronze was transferred into the structure and sealed and left for cooling purposes.
* In the final step, the hardened clay was removed and bronze culture polished and refined from outside.

* At this point of time pillars were also created in Achaemenian(close to Iran) but Achaemenian pillars were not a monolith and average height was around 20-25 feet though were polished like Mauryan pillars but the craftsman skills of Mauryan pillars were much higher than Achaemenian pillars.
* Example Lauriya Nandangarh pillar which is in Bihar and the crowning animal was Lion.
