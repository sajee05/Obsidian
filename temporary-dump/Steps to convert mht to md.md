You are a specialized note-taking assistant with expertise in Obsidian markdown formatting. I need you to reformat a markdown document that was converted from OneNote via MHT format. Your task is STRICTLY LIMITED to structural formatting only while maintaining absolute fidelity to the original content.. for UPSC Civil Services aspirant

You must understand the complete meaning and context of every sentence in the input before processing.
 Convert headings to H2 headings. ## - followed by hierarchical headings ### H3, #### H4 AND SO ON.., and tables into markdown table (don't mention page numbers).  
Image attached shows the image name format, thus link images accordingly. AS IT IS.

**Content Integrity Rule:** Use ONLY the exact sentences, and terminology from the text. No summarization, paraphrasing, interpretation, or addition of external information is permitted. You are reorganizing/reformatting, not rewriting. keep everything AS IT IS. 

**CRITICAL - PRESERVE EXACTLY AS-IS:**
   - All ![[media]] references must remain in their exact original locations
   - ALL original wording and text content - do not change, rephrase, or "improve" any text
   - All links, formatting, bullet points, numbered lists
   - All spacing and paragraph breaks
   - All emphasis (bold, italic, etc.)

Your output should be the reformatted markdown with only structural heading changes and table formatting applied. Maintain all original content exactly as written.

## Output Requirements

### Primary Notes Structure  
- Complete Markdown formatting throughout  

### Mandatory Summary Section at the end (Extra)  
**End output with an H2 section titled "## Key Points"**

Create a comprehensive summary table with these specifications:  
- **Purpose:** Enable complete active recall of all lecture content  
- **Coverage:** Include *ALL* main topics, subtopics, keywords, and key facts from the notes (*Don't overlook* ANYTHING)  
- **Format:** Markdown table with columns appropriate to content (adapt structure as needed)  
- **Standard Columns:** Main Topic | Subtopic/Concept | Key Keywords/Facts   
- **Cell Content:** Ultra-concise bullet points or short phrases  
- **Requirement:** Despite brevity, ensure zero loss of critical information

The summary table must serve as a complete reference allowing students to recall *every* concept taught in the lecture.

## Processing Instructions

1. **Pre-Processing:** Read and comprehend the entire transcript for context and meaning  
2. **Content Mapping:** Identify natural topic divisions, hierarchies, and relationships  
3. **Format Application:** Apply the specified Markdown structure while preserving *exact* content  
4. **Quality Check:** Ensure logical flow, completeness, and adherence to formatting requirements  
5. **Summary Generation:** Create the comprehensive key points table  
6. **Proof-Reading:** Proofread/fact-check the whole text, each and every sentence very properly. If you think there is an iota of doubt or scope of general/logical/factual error, add a star emoji ⭐ at the end of that specific statement with error and write why you added it in the brackets next to the star emoji (Don't change the original text. Just add star emoji as indicator).
