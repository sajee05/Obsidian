## NUMISMATICS

### Gupta period demonstrated level of excellence

- **Artistic excellence**: detailed engravings, aesthetic appeal
  - Example: The gold dinars of CHANDRAGUPTA II
- **Standards and uniformity in coinage**: highlight advance minting technology
  - Example: The consistency in weight, size, and purity of GUPTA gold coins is unmatched
- **Features cultural and religious symbols**
  - Example: The depiction of the goddess LAKSHMI on GUPTA coins

### Decline in later period

- **Shift in priorities**: less on artistic detail and more on mass production
- **Change in material**: greater use of less precious metals like copper
- **Political instability**
- **Economic constraints**

However, this is a generalization and there would be certainly examples of exceptional coinage being produced even after the GUPTA era.
