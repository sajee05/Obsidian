**For Notes**
add #review tag, double shift/3 dots = hard/good/easy 

the notes will also be in the review if #📍remember OR #📍remember/forgetting tags are being used. (had to start with hard first.)

notes with these tags will show up in flashcard button under tag folder in left sidebar.
put all #📹Lecture Notes in here. with active recall table, made with prompt. and review it spaced.
