## 28\. Economic Impact of British Rule in India

### Deindustrialisation

- Charter Act 1813: one-way free trade benefiting Britain
- Indian products: 80% European tariffs, markets virtually closed after 1820
- Rail network: European products reached remote areas
- India: From net exporter to net importer

#### No Steps towards modern Industrialisation

- Europe: Rapidly industrialising
- India: Deindustrialised to serve British interest

#### Ruralisation

- Decline of cities
- Artisans abandoned crafts for agriculture → Increased pressure on already overburdened agriculture sector

### Impoverishment of Peasantry

- Permanent Settlement: Transferable land $→Led To$ tenant insecurity
- Zamindars resorted to summary evictions, illegal dues, and "begar"
- Peasants
	- Sold grain at low prices to moneylender to clear zamindari dues
	- Under triple burden: Government, Zamindar, Moneylender

### Emergence of Intermediaries, Absentee Landlordism, Ruin of Old Zamindars

- 1815: Half of Bengal land transferred to merchants/moneylenders
- New zamindars: Land grabbing, sub-infeudation, absentee landlordism
- No investment in agricultural improvements

### Stagnation and Deterioration of Agriculture

- Cultivator: No means/incentives for investment + Minimal government agricultural support
- Land fragmentation → perpetually low productivity

### Famines

- Caused by poverty, not just scarcity
- 1857-1900: 2.8 crore famine deaths

### Commercialisation of Indian Agriculture

- Late 19th century: Agriculture shifted from subsistence to commercial enterprise
- Cash crops (cotton, jute, groundnut, oilseeds, sugarcane, tobacco) grown for national/international markets
- Plantation sector (tea, coffee, rubber): European-owned
- Factors encouraging commercialisation
	- Spread of money economy
	- Custom + Tradition $→Replace By$ Contract + Competition
	- Unified national market, British capital
- For peasants
	- Forced commercialisation process with limited investment surplus
	- 1860s: Cotton boom benefited intermediaries; 1866 price slump caused indebtedness, famine
	- Cultivators received minimal benefits from commercialisation

### Destruction of Industry and Late Development of Modern Industry

- Systematic destruction of Indian industries
	- Textiles
		- British stopped paying in pounds
		- Paid from Bengal revenue at artificially low rates
	- Shipbuilding
		- Destroyed shipbuilding centres, West: Surat + Malabar, East: Masulipatnam + Bengal
		- British ships granted monopoly trade, Indian ships faced heavy duties
		- ==1813==: Ships below 350 tonnes prohibited from India-Britain routes
			- ==1814==: Indian-built ships denied "British-registered vessels" status for America/Europe trade
	- Steel
		- Tata → Forced to produce higher quality steel, Restricted to domestic market only
- Indian Traders, Moneylenders, and Bankers
	- Accumulated wealth but remained subordinate to English merchant capitalists
	- Moneylenders: Provided farmer loans, facilitating colonial revenue collection
	- Traders: Distributed British imports and collected agricultural exports
	- Indigenous bankers: Supported both distribution and collection systems
- Indigenous industries
	- 1854: First cotton textile mill in Bombay
	- 1855: First jute mill in Rishra (Bengal)
	- Handicaps
		- Credit problems
		- No tariff protection
		- Unequal foreign competition
	- Lopsided development
		- Core, heavy industries, power generation → Neglected
		- Regional disparities: Some region favoured more than others
		- No technical education

### Nationalist Critique of Colonial Economy

- Early 19th century: Intellectuals supported British rule, expecting modernization
- 1860s: Disillusionment began; intellectuals examined British rule's reality
- Economic Analysts
	- Dadabhai Naoroji: Developed economic drain theory in "Poverty and UnBritish Rule"
	- Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade
	- Romesh Chandra Dutt: The Economic Theory of India

Economic Drain

- India's wealth diverted to Britain without adequate returns
- Components: British officials' salaries, loan interest, foreign investment profits, service payments
- Hindered Indian capital formation while accelerating British economy
- British surplus entered as finance capital (i.e Indian wealth recycled back to India in the form of loans and investments), further draining wealth

#### British Policies Making India Poor

- Nationalist View
	- India impoverished by British imperialism
	- Poverty viewed as national productive capacity issue
	- Advocated independent economy based on modern industries
	- Foreign capital: Suppressed Indian capital development + Created interests perpetuating colonial rule

#### Growth of Trade and Railways to Help Britain

- Trade pattern: India relegated to raw material exporter, finished goods importer
- Railways
	- Not aligned with India's industrial needs
	- Enabled foreign goods to outsell indigenous products
	- Benefits from railway investments accrued to Britain
	- G.V. Joshi: Railway expenditure was "Indian subsidy to British industries"

#### One-Way Free Trade and Tariff Policy

- One way free trade ruined Indian handicrafts industry
- Taxes burdened poor while sparing British interests
- Government expenditure served colonial needs, ignored development

#### Effect of Economic Drain

- Denuded India of productive capital
- Drain estimated at
	- ≥ land revenue
	- Half government revenue
	- 8% of national product

### Economic Issue a Stimulant to National Unrest

| Infrastructure | • Military organization changes | • British investment in railways, plantations, mining | • Large British capital invested in railways, loans, plantations, coal mining, jute mills, shipping, banking |
| Ideological Justification | • Economic exploitation | • Colonial administration to serve British interests | • "Trusteeship" and "White Man's burden" |
| Miscellaneous | • Wealth drain constituted 2-3% of Britain's national income   • Financed Britain's industrial revolution | • Import duties removed or reduced   • Indian weavers ruined by Company's monopoly | • Britain's industrial supremacy challenged by other countries   • Indian Army used for British expansion in Asia and Africa |
